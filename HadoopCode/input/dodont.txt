     9		I have been programming for twenty years on all sorts of computers,
    10	but the PC is my favorite.  I've seen it all (almost), and done it all
    11	(almost) and I'd like to take this opportunity to help those of you who have
    12	just purchased your first PC.  I am going to give you a few do's and don'ts
    13	- feel free to disagree, but at least I'll give you some interesting ideas
    14	to think about.  First of all, if you have not yet purchased a PC, please
    15	follow the following RULES OF PC PURCHASE:
    16	
    17			   1. If you can, buy at least a 286 or 386.
    18			      (Why? Because the older 8086 PC's are
    19			       just TOO SLOW!)
    20			   2. Get the biggest hard disk you can afford.
    21			      (Why? Because they fill up with good
    22			      software much faster than you would expect.)
    23			   3. Get a color monitor, preferably VGA.
    24			      (Why? Because I like color, of course,
    25			      and have three monochrome monitors
    26			      sitting unused in my closet!)
    27			   4. Make sure one of your floppies is 5 1/4 inch
    28			      size (that's the standard size).
    29	
    30	
    31		Now that you have your PC up and running, here are the things
    32		to do:
    33	1. FOCUS YOUR INTERESTS.  Try to figure out why you got a PC and what you
    34	   want to do with it.  Are you interested in writing, music, art, programming
    35	   or what.  Come on, you must be interested in something! A PC can be used
    36	   for virtually anything.  It is even good for teaching your child to read
    37	   (Reader Rabbit, Amy's Primer). Focus, focus, focus.
    38	
    39	2. USE A SURGE SUPPRESSOR. Go ahead, I know you are almost broke after
    40	   buying that 220 Megabyte hard disk, but GET A SURGE SUPPRESSOR BEFORE
    41	   YOU TURN IT ON!  The very first night I put together my first PC,
    42	   there was a huge thunder and lightning storm.  My house wiring took
    43	   a direct hit while my $3500 investment was on for the very first time!
    44	   A surge suppressor saved my bacon by turning off automatically. After
    45	   30 minutes it mysteriously went back on by itself, and my PC was undamaged.
    46	
    47	3. TRY DESKTOP PUBLISHING & A WORD PROCESSOR. Remember using a typewriter?
    48	   One tiny mistake and you had to retype the whole page! Now, with any
    49	   simple word processor, you can correct your errors before you print the
    50	   first copy. And if you write a lot of letters, it's great to have an
    51	   automatic file of all the letters you wrote on your hard disk, complete
    52	   with addresses.  Desktop publishing is also a terrific advance, and
    53	   with inexpensive products like Publish It! or First Publisher, it is
    54	   also easy to get started.  Perhaps you have an idea for your own
    55	   newsletter?
    56	
    57	4.TRY LOTUS 123 OR ANOTHER SIMILAR SPREADSHEET. The PC became so incredibly
    58	  popular because of Lotus (and Word Processing).  Though I personally am
    59	  bored to tears by spreadsheets, fifty million users can't be wrong,
    60	  so give it a try.
    61	
    62	5.TRY THE BASIC INTERPRETER YOU GOT WITH YOUR MACHINE. Basic, or the GWBASIC
    63	  you probably got free with your clone, is an easy and surprisingly powerful
    64	  language (GW stands for Gee Whiz!).  Even if you plan to buy most
    65	  of your software, you will understand your PC much better if you write a
    66	  few simple BASIC programs of your own.  If you find you like BASIC, you
    67	  may eventually want to move up to QuickBasic or Turbo Basic, which
    68	  run about $69.95 and allow you to compile your Basic Programs to true
    69	  EXE files, just like the professional programs you buy.
    70	
    71	6.LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT DOS.  The Disk Operating System you got with your
    72	  machine is also a powerful language, and you should run, not walk, to
    73	  your nearest bookstore and buy the slimmest book you can find about DOS.
    74	
    75	7.GET A HARD DISK & LEARN TO ORGANIZE IT.  If you already have a PC without
    76	  a Hard Disk, you have already experienced the incredible frustration
    77	  of computing from only one or two floppies. Get a Hard Disk, 40 Megabyte
    78	  minimum.  It shouldn't cost much more than $300. Right now, there is
    79	  a mail-order bargain on the Seagate 65 Meg RLL Drive.  You will need
    80	  an RLL Controller, but the disk is only $260 and built like a tank.
    81	  (See Computer Shopper).
    82	
    83	8. GET THE NORTON UTILITIES. This bag of tricks and techniques will more
    84	  than pay for itself with Quick Unerase, which will allow you to easily
    85	  recover those files you deleted by mistake.
    86	
    87	9. BACKUP IRREPLACEABLE FILES TO FLOPPY DISKS. If you are writing the
    88	   great American Novel, copy your work once a week to a floppy and stash
    89	   it in a safe place.  It only takes a second, and imagine how you
    90	   would feel if the only copy on your hard disk somehow became
    91	   unreadable.  I leave the question of full hard disk backups completely
    92	   up to you.  If you have a lot of important files on your hard disk
    93	   it may be advisable, even if it takes 60 or more floppies. Fastback Plus
    94	   or DSBackup can ease the task. I don't personally backup, but I have
    95	   three machines (one 386, one 286 and one old 8086) and each has copies
    96	   of my most important files.  They are all surge protected, and the
    97	   chance of three simultaneuos hard disk disasters is only 1 in 47,000,000.
    98	   (Approximately).
    99	
   100	10. BUY A DOZEN SHAREWARE PROGRAMS FOR $1.99 EACH, AND REGISTER AT LEAST ONE.
   101	   Shareware is an interesting and inexpensive way to experience a broad
   102	   range of software. It is a unique marketing concept - try before you
   103	   buy. You will help keep it alive, and more good shareware coming, if
   104	   you register the shareware you like and continue to use. You will
   105	   absolutely need a simple ASCII Editor to use your PC properly.
   106	   Without a simple editor, even changing your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
   107	   is a real chore. QEDIT is nice. Put PROMPT $P $G in your
   108	   AUTOEXEC.BAT file RIGHT NOW if it isn't already there. It
   109	   identifies directory names when you change directories.
   110	
   111	11. TRY SOME ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAMS TO PEEK INTO THE FUTURE
   112	    OF COMPUTING.  You have probably heard about Expert Systems, that
   113	    follow rules-of-thumb to give advice like a human expert, but
   114	    through Shareware you can also try one yourself. Other areas are
   115	    Natural Language Programs, that respond to your english language
   116	    sentences, and Neural Networks that mimic the thought process of the
   117	    human brain.  Many can be experienced at low cost through shareware,
   118	    or though the miracle of Modems and Bulletin Boards. Or you could
   119	    select one of the three very special packages we'll introduce you
   120	    to at the end of this Tutorial. Each package is usually $99.95,
   121	    but is offered here for only $59.95.
   122	
   123	12. AFTER YOU ARE FAIRLY COMFORTABLE WITH DOS, TRY WINDOWS 3.0.
   124	    Windows 3.0 is a GUI or Graphical User Interface.  It requires
   125	    the use of a Mouse, because you operate Windows by pointing and
   126	    clicking with the Mouse.  It also requires a serious 286 or 386
   127	    computer with VGA and plenty of hard disk space.  Windows alone
   128	    wants about 5 Meg of your hard drive geography.
   129	    Although most of what you want to do on a computer does not
   130	    require Windows, you should eventually try it, because it
   131	    probably represents the future of PC Computing.
   132	
   133	
   134			THINGS YOU SHOULD TRY TO AVOID
   135	DON'T:
   136	     Move your PC without very good reason. It can destroy the
   137		 programs on your hard disk.
   138	     Get any weird programs that mess with your hard disk if you
   139	     havn't had a problem!
   140	     Make millions of directories within directories.
   141	     Keep your hard disk almost full.
   142	     Worry about OS/2 - it is a dead issue for home users.
   143	     Leave your machine on all the time.
   144	     Worry if you can't learn to program in C, Lisp or Prolog.
   145	     Write COBOL on a PC.
   146	     Worry much about Viruses. They are dying down now.
   147	     Load your machine so full of TSR's at start-up that it gets confused.
   148	     Open your computer unless you absolutely have to.
   149	     Upgrade to a 386 if you have a fast 286.
   150	     Upgrade at all - buy another machine. Two is nice.
   151	     Try to to turn your PC into a MAC - buy a MAC.
   152	     Don't overload your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
   153	     Don't type FORMAT C: unless you really mean it!
   154	
   155	
   156			 A QUICK INTRO TO DOS FOR BEGINNERS ONLY
   157	
   158	     DOS stands for Disk Operating System.  It started ten years
   159	     ago at Version 1.0 and then matured with 3.1 and 3.3. It
   160	     gives your machine the primitive intelligence required to
   161	     run programs (Applications), and organize a hard drive.
   162	
   163	     DOS 4.1 is current as of the beginning of 1991, but a Beta-test
   164	     Version of DOS 5.0 is already available to industry insiders.
   165	     It is recommended.  DOS is a brilliant engineering accomplishment
   166	     by Microsoft.  Over the years, hundreds of very bright programmers
   167	     have contributed to it.
   168	
   169	     DOS is built around the concept of a Hard Drive divided into
   170	     file folders called Directories.  C:\ is the root.
   171	     C:\DOS > is a direcory OFF the ROOT. (You could think of branches
   172	     off a tree, and yes, there are often directories within directories.)
   173	     Try to avoid copying files to your root.
   174	     Instead, make a new Directory (file folder) with a meaningful
   175	     name (MONEY, TEMP, WORK, NEW, LOTUS, WORD, etc) and change
   176	     to that Directory. Then copy your files into that Directory.
   177	     The exact commands are given below, and you will keep your
   178	     Hard Drive neat and tidy.
   179	
   180	
   181	     Most used Commands: (you press the ENTER KEY after you type
   182				  any one of these commands.  Practice on
   183				  a formatted floppy, not your hard drive.)
   184	
   185	
   186		DIR produces a directory list of files and programs on the
   187		    disk, example DIR A:, or just DIR
   188		DIR/P pauses when the screen is full for long Directories
   189		DIR/W (Directory Wide) puts the Directory list in several
   190		    columns across the screen
   191		COPY copies a file or program to a new name, new directory
   192		    or new disk, example COPY *.*  C:
   193		    (If you have a new disk in A: and want to copy ALL the
   194		    programs on the disk to C: you would type this at the
   195		    A:> prompt.)
   196		CD changes from one directory to another. CD\ changes back
   197		    to the root    CD\MYDIR, then to change back: CD\
   198		MD makes a new directory
   199		    example MD MYDIR
   200		TYPE displays the contents of an ASCII file on the screen
   201		    TYPE ORDER.FRM
   202		PRINT prints a file on the printer
   203		    PRINT ORDER.FRM or COPY ORDER.FRM LPT1
   204		    Note: there really is an ORDER.FRM on this disk,
   205		    so you can try this command later on the MoneyMaker Disk!
   206		Pressing the Shift/Print Screen Keys causes the current
   207		     screen to be printed
   208		DEL deletes a file....be careful   DEL BADPGM.EXE
   209		RD removes an empty directory      RD MYDIR
   210	
   211		Using different disk drives: to switch to another drive,
   212		     type the letter of the drive followed by a colon
   213		File Extensions: File names are made up of three parts:
   214		a name, a period, and an extension, example  LOTUS.EXE
   215		name: up to eight characters
   216		extension: up to three characters
   217		Some extensions are reserved names: EXE, COM, BAT
   218		an EXE or COM file is a program ready to run just by
   219		   typing the first part of the name (and pressing ENTER)
   220		a BAT file consists of DOS Language statements, and
   221		    most BAT files are used to start COM or EXE programs
   222		    The AUTOEXEC.BAT File runs automatically whenever
   223		    you boot or start your PC.
   224	
   225		 if you get hopelessly confused, just BOOT!
   226		 (turn your computer OFF and back ON, or
   227		 press CTRL-ALT-DEL simultaneously).
   228	
   229		 LIST.COM, included on this disk, should be installed
   230		 in the Root Directory of your PC.  It is better than
   231		 the type command.  To use it, just type LIST followed
   232		 by the text file name you want to read.  When you
   233		 EXIT the Main Menu from AITUTOR, try typing
   234		 LIST CATALOG.TXT to read a selection from our AI Catalog.
   235	
   236		 Serious DOS mistakes:
   237		 typing FORMAT C: (erases your whole C: Drive)
   238		 not backing up critical files to floppy disks
   239		 typing DEL *.* in your ROOT (deletes all root files)
   240		 pouring coffee in your keyboard. (keyboards prefer water).
