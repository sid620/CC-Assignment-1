     1	February 10, 1991, Boston, MA -- Output Technology Corporation, (OUTPUT)
     2	will showcase its new BetterYet line, designed to provide complete laser
     3	enhancement solutions for Hewlett Packard LaserJet and compatible laser
     4	printers. Leading the new product line is BetterYet III, a PCL-5 emulation
     5	cartridge that upgrades HP LaserJet Series 11 printers to HP LaserJet III
     6	compatibility.
     7	
     8	"Upgrading to LaserJet III capability will become more and more critical to
     9	corporations," said John Lugviel, Vice President of Sales & Marketing.
    10	"The full power and capabilities of today's software, including Microsoft
    11	Windows, WordPerfect, and Windows-based programs, has driven user demand
    12	to remarkable levels. And, the majority of these capabilities, such as
    13	scalable fonts, are only accessible with the LaserJet III."
    14	
    15	The BetterYet III plug-in cartridge provides an alternative upgrade
    16	solution that's easily installed by the user into a font slot, and that
    17	also allows corporations to standardize their equipment at LaserJet III
    18	levels at minimal cost. "We see this upgrade as a way for corporations to
    19	preserve their capital assets, leveraging the significant investment
    20	already made in Series ll printers," Lugviel added.
    21	
    22	Also introduced as part of the BetterYet product series is a complete line
    23	of other enhancement products, featuring the widest range of font types
    24	and special fonts available on single cartridges.
    25	
    26	The BetterYet line was developed in collaboration with several leading
    27	industry technology partners, including: Intel Corporation, who provided
    28	the chip technology; Agfa Corporation, who supplied Intellifont scaling
    29	technology and typefaces; and PeerLess Group, who supplied the printer
    30	emulations.
