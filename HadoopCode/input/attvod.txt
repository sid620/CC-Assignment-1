    10	FOR RELEASE: MONDAY, MAY 4, 1992
    11	
    12	     MORRISTOWN, N.J. -- AT&T said today it will provide technology and 
    13	equipment to companies to help them deliver a host of new entertainment 
    14	offerings -- including pay-per-view and video-on-demand services -- to 
    15	their customers.
    16	
    17	     Using digital compression technology, AT&T will offer an "end-to-
    18	end" system -- ranging from equipment used by program providers down to 
    19	the set-top box in people's homes -- to help speed the delivery of 
    20	entertainment services to consumers.
    21	
    22	     Today's announcement is the latest in a series of offerings 
    23	reflecting AT&T's commitment to visual communications over a variety of 
    24	media and through various providers.
    25	
    26	     "Digital signal processing is one of AT&T's key strengths," said 
    27	Robert M. Kavner, group executive, communications products. "AT&T 
    28	expects to use this strength to become a leader in visual 
    29	communications, including both transmission products and services for 
    30	digital standard and high-definition television."
    31	
    32	     Working with partners such as the ComStream Corporation and News 
    33	Datacom, AT&T will provide an integrated system to deliver entertainment 
    34	programming via satellite to headend locations and then to people's 
    35	homes, said Bob Stanzione, vice president- transmission systems.
    36	
    37	     ComStream Corp., a leading supplier of satellite products and 
    38	networks, will work with AT&T to provide the equipment needed to 
    39	transmit compressed channels via satellite to the headend location.
    40	
    41	     News Datacom, a subsidiary of The News Corporation Limited, will 
    42	provide the systems needed to authorize and process customer requests 
    43	for programs.  The company's encryption/security system uses "Smart 
    44	Card" technology to give cable operators the highest level of protection 
    45	against program theft by unauthorized persons.  AT&T initially will 
    46	provide the satellite program delivery system needed to carry channels 
    47	from programmers to the "headend" office of cable television service 
    48	providers.  The system is comprised of compression, transmission and 
    49	access control network elements at the satellite up-link and down-link 
    50	sites.
    51	
    52	     Following testing later this year, equipment for the satellite 
    53	delivery system will be available for sale in 1993.
    54	
    55	     At the same time, AT&T is exploring potential partnerships for and 
    56	continuing development of the cable-plant portion of the system -- from 
    57	the cable headend to consumers' homes.  The company ultimately plans to 
    58	offer an end-to-end system that will boost the capacity of today's cable 
    59	networks 3-13 times.
    60	
    61	     The digital compression technology underlying today's system 
    62	announcement is key to paving the way for new entertainment options for 
    63	people.
    64	
    65	     AT&T's video compression algorithm for cable television service is 
    66	based on the one used in the high-definition television (HDTV) system 
    67	that AT&T and Zenith Electronics Corp. are asking the Federal 
    68	Communications Commission (FCC) to adopt as the U.S.  HDTV standard.
    69	
    70	     The technology -- an outgrowth of advanced research in Bell 
    71	Laboratories -- allows programmers to squeeze 4-18 television channels 
    72	onto a single satellite transponder, and 3-13 digitally compressed 
    73	channels onto a conventional analog cable channel. Without digital 
    74	compression, only one channel could be transmitted over a single 
    75	satellite transponder to the cable headend.
    76	
    77	     Bottomline, the technology is expected to have a dramatic impact by 
    78	making available to consumers hundreds of new entertainment offerings in 
    79	movies, live-action sports, homeshopping, in-home education services, 
    80	etc.  Not only that, it will give people the shows and services they 
    81	want, when they want them.
    82	
    83	     AT&T already is working with U S WEST and Tele- Communications, 
    84	Inc. (TCI) to explore two video entertainment services -- enhanced pay-
    85	per-view and video-on-demand -- in a market trial set to begin this 
    86	summer.  The trial, which uses existing technology, is designed to 
    87	measure customer reaction to and acceptance of these services.
    88	
    89	     AT&T's commitment to create innovative visual communications 
    90	products and services has been demonstrated through several earlier 
    91	announcements this year.
    92	
    93	     In January, AT&T introduced the VideoPhone 2500, which delivers 
    94	images of calling parties through ordinary phone lines. The company 
    95	subsequently introduced the AT&T Group Video System, a compact, 
    96	rollabout system that can extend digital videoconferencing throughout a 
    97	business.  Global Business Video Services recently expanded its service 
    98	offerings, and NCR announced a multi-media automatic teller machine 
    99	(ATM) with video-conferencing capabilities.
   100	
   101	     In addition, AT&T Microelectronics introduced a video codec chip 
   102	set that will permit videoconferencing and full-motion video on 
   103	equipment as compact as desktop PCs and video telephones, and as varied 
   104	as teller machines and point-of-sale terminals.
   105	
   106	     Digital compression technology will be demonstrated in AT&T's 
   107	exhibit at the National Cable Television Association (NCTA) convention 
   108	this week in Dallas, Texas.
   109	
   110	     By offering compression technology and equipment to cable and 
   111	telephone companies, AT&T expects the entire market for visual 
   112	communications will grow to the benefit of all.

   117	                          Backgrounder
   118	                     on Digital Compression
   119	                           Technology
   120	
   121	
   122	     Digital compression uses computer and algorithm techniques to 
   123	compress a video signal from 216 Mb/s (CCIR-601) or 120 Mb/s (NTSC) to 
   124	between 1.5-8 Mb/s while maintaining good picture quality.  With digital 
   125	compression, more programs can be squeezed into a single transponder, 
   126	and more channels can be packed into a 6 Megahertz slot on the broadband 
   127	cable spectrum.
   128	
   129	     The technology promises a host of benefits to cable programmers, 
   130	operators and subscribers.  For programmers, it means up to 18 programs 
   131	can be transmitted via a single satellite transponder to the cable 
   132	headend.  Up until now, a single satellite transponder could only handle 
   133	one program per channel.
   134	
   135	     With this technology, the amount of compression -- also known as 
   136	the compression ratio -- can be flexibly selected by a service provider 
   137	to match a particular service offering like pay-per-view movies and 
   138	video-on-demand, live-action sports, in-home education, homeshopping, 
   139	etc.
   140	
   141	     For example, compressed rates as low as 1.5 Mb/s can be used to 
   142	provide fairly inexpensive -- but highly compressed -- VCR- quality 
   143	services from film sources.  On the other hand, an 8 Mb/s compression 
   144	rate can transmit the most complex video material -- a Superbowl game, 
   145	for example -- while maintaining the highest "broadcast quality" picture 
   146	for viewers or other distributors.
   147	
   148	     Digital compression not only provides programmers with tremendous 
   149	savings, it offers spectrum capacity that wasn't previously available 
   150	for new types of programming.
   151	
   152	     Once the technology is fully deployed, it's expected to boost the 
   153	capacity of today's cable networks 3 to 13 times.  With more programs 
   154	and channels squeezed into a set amount of space, the technology 
   155	ultimately will allow hundreds of programs to be transmitted from cable 
   156	operator "headend" locations to subscribers' homes.
   157	
   158	     More channels for cable operators means, of course, new sources of 
   159	revenues.  For cable TV subscribers, digital compression will provide a 
   160	wealth of new video services.  Enhanced pay-per-view -- giving people 
   161	the shows they want, when they want it -- video-on-demand and 
   162	interactive services are just some of the possibilities.  In fact, the 
   163	technology promises applications that have yet to be developed or even 
   164	imagined.
   165	
   166	     AT&T's video compression algorithm is based on the one used in the 
   167	high-definition television (HDTV) system that AT&T and Zenith 
   168	Electronics Corp.  are asking the Federal Communications Commission 
   169	(FCC) to adopt as the U.S. HDTV standard.
   170	
   171	     AT&T proposed its program delivery system to CableLabs, Inc. 
   172	(CableLabs), Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI), Viacom International and 
   173	the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) last December after the industry 
   174	consortium asked companies to describe how digital compression 
   175	technology could be deployed.

   180	                Backgrounder on AT&T/TCI/U S WEST
   181	                      Video Services Trial
   182	
   183	
   184	     This summer, AT&T, Telecommunications, Inc. (TCI) and U S WEST will 
   185	begin a market test of two services -- enhanced pay-per- view and video-
   186	on-demand -- in a suburb of Denver, Colo.  The test, which will use 
   187	current technology, is being conducted to measure customer reaction to 
   188	and acceptance of "viewer-controlled cable television" (VCTV) services.
   189	
   190	     The trial will allow customers to view programming in two ways.  
   191	Half of the more than 400 customers participating in the test will use a 
   192	remote control device to select more than 1,000 movies and special 
   193	events from a printed guide.  Customers will have total control over 
   194	what to watch and when, without having to leave home.  They'll also be 
   195	able to "pause" programs for up to 10 minutes at a time.
   196	
   197	     The other half of the test group will be able to watch any of 15 
   198	movies and features a day, at least six of which will be available at 
   199	any one time.
   200	
   201	     About halfway through the test, both groups will receive both 
   202	services.  In all cases, the services will be offered in addition to 
   203	TCI's regular cable service.  And Denver-based consumers who do not 
   204	currently subscribe to cable TV will be able to participate in the test, 
   205	which is expected to run for between 12-18 months.
   206	
   207	     AT&T is participating in the trial to gain insights into customer 
   208	desires so it can develop and deploy technology that best meets 
   209	customers' needs.
   210	
   211	     Jerrold Communications, a division of General Instrument Corp., 
   212	will supply the set-top equipment that will be installed in customers' 
   213	homes for the duration of the test, as well as the modulators, encoders 
   214	and scramblers for the video source systems.
   215	
   216	     Optical Networks International is supplying the AT&T LaserLink II 
   217	optoelectronics and AT&T fiber-optic cable that TCI and U S WEST will 
   218	use for their portions of the test network.
   219	
   220	     TCI, headquartered in Denver, is the nation's largest cable 
   221	television company.  It serves 11.3 million cable customers in 48 
   222	states.
   223	
   224	     AT&T Network Systems, headquartered in Morristown, N.J., is among 
   225	the world's largest suppliers of communications network equipment.  
   226	AT&T's equipment is designed by AT&T Bell Laboratories, the research and 
   227	development arm of AT&T.  Its products include digital switching and 
   228	transmission equipment, fiber-optic and copper cable, operations support 
   229	and data networking systems, and wireless systems for mobile phone 
   230	networks.
   231	
   232	     U S WEST owns companies involved in communications, marketing, 
   233	services and financial services, as well as cable and telecommunications 
   234	operations in the United Kingdom, France, Hungary and Scandinavia.  U S 
   235	WEST Communications provides telecommunications services to 25 million 
   236	customers in 14 western states.
