     7	Jim Thomas is an associate professor in Sociology.  Gordon Meyer
     8	received his M.A.   in Sociology in 1989.   They are currently
     9	researching the computer underground from which the data for this
    10	note are drawn.

    13	The university policy against  computer software piracy has
    14	been widely publicized,  including in a recent issue of Computing
    15	News (December, 1989).   There is no question that the university
    16	must protect  itself against actions  of the NIU  community for
    17	which it could be held legally accountable.   However,  based on
    18	our current research of the "computer underground" and the active-
    19	ities of "phreaks, hackers,  and pirates," we find no evidence to
    20	support the many value judgments  offered in the rationale circu-
    21	lated by the university.  These normative judgments contribute to
    22	law enforcement tendencies to expand the definitions of illegali-
    23	ty and, as one recent government publication has done,  to place
    24	piracy in the  same category of crimes as  "computer theft" and
    25	"theft of trade secrets."  Our intent  here is neither to justify
    26	software piracy nor to challenge University policy.  However, be-
    27	cause the area of copyright and  "computer abuse" law is so new,
    28	and because these laws tend to rely in media and other depictions
    29	of "computer underground" activeity as criminally sanctionable, we
    30	challenge conceptions  of underground activeity that  seem unsub-
    31	stantiated by evidence.
    32	
    33	The university's normative justification  of the University
    34	policy can be summarized in three broad principles:
    35	
    36	1. Software piracy shows disrespect for the intellectual work
    37	   and property of others and subverts the mission of higher
    38	   education.
    39	
    40	2.  Software piracy deprives authors of  a "fair return" for
    41	    their work.
    42	
    43	3. Software piracy is unethical.
    44	
    45	These assertions help justify  criminalization and corresponding
    46	sanctions.   However,  The data from our research do not support
    47	these judgments for several reasons.   First,  software pirates
    48	make a clear distinction between  "pirates," persons who collect
    49	and share software for as hobbyists akin to stamp collectors, and
    50	"bootleggers." Bootleggers  are persons who  distribute software
    51	for material gain.  Pirates may copy and install programs,  but
    52	generally their goal is to collect,  and they derive satisfaction
    53	from running programs for which they  have no need and that they
    54	will rarely, if ever, use.
    55	
    56	Second,  software  pirates--despite the claims of  the SPA
    57	(Software Publishsers Association)--report  spending considerably
    58	more money purchasing software than  the average user.  Many of
    59	these purchases are for trading,  and there is a strong ethos in
    60	the pirate world that if one  uses a program,  one purchases it.
    61	Reasons for purchasing include documentation,  acquiring informa-
    62	tion about and discounts on updates,  and on-line technical sup-
    63	port.  It is quite common for pirates to purchase identical pro-
    64	grams to those they have already obtained.
    65	
    66	Third, the "no return" policy of most software merchandisers
    67	makes it difficult for potential buyers  to assess the ability of
    68	a program to meet their needs or work adequately on their system.
    69	Piracy creates an informed public  by assuring that programs are
    70	available for pre-testing, by providing a pool of reasonably lit-
    71	erate users to publicly discuss the merits of competing products,
    72	and to even  offer technical assistance to those  who have pur-
    73	chased a program.   In this sense, the "unauthorized" copying of
    74	software can be seen as contributing to the university mission of
    75	expanding knowledge, of preventing exploitation of consumers, and
    76	above all,  to the expansion of computer literacy contributing to
    77	the free flow of information.
    78	
    79	Fourth,  pirates spend a considerable  sum on their hobby.
    80	Among the  most active topics  of discussion among  pirates are
    81	those of the need to endlessly upgrade,  the endless purchase of
    82	diskettes on which to store programs, and--with the popularity of
    83	9600 baud  modems--the advantages of investing  between $600-900
    84	for expanding telecommunications hardware.   Because most pirates
    85	exchange software across telephone lines,  piracy has benefitted
    86	telephone companies because of the  growth of Bulletin Board Sys-
    87	tems (BBSs). Our data indicate that an average monthly phone bill
    88	of $200 or more is common,  and active pirates easily double that
    89	cost.
    90	
    91	Fifth,  there is simply no evidence to corroborate the claim
    92	that piracy deprives authors of  revenue.  Our data suggest that
    93	pirates annually purchase no less than  three times the 1.5 pro-
    94	grams the SPA estimates for the "average" user, purchases direct-
    95	ly related to the hobby rather than a need. Further, few students
    96	or faculty could afford the price of Dbase 4 and other large pro-
    97	grams, and few people could afford to spend several thousand dol-
    98	lars a year on computer games.  Traded programs would simply re-
    99	main unpurchased. Because piracy creates an interest in software,
   100	expands consumer literacy,  and contributes  to a "user culture"
   101	that benefits the industry as a  whole,  we suggest that without
   102	such a culture there would be less interest in software and, con-
   103	sequently, less revenue for authors.
   104	
   105	Sixth,  the claim that piracy is unethical is usually a glib
   106	one made without a strong rationale. Although we make no metaphy-
   107	sical claims here,  we do suggest that the appeal to ethic in at-
   108	tempts to criminalize piracy is far  too serious to be so glibly
   109	asserted, and the underlying issues require far more research and
   110	debate.  Even in the debates over VCR reproduction and photocopy-
   111	ing books or journal articles, the appeal to ethics was never ad-
   112	duced as stridently  and self-righteously as in  discussions of
   113	software piracy.
   114	
   115	The rapid growth of computer and telecommunications technol-
   116	ogy brings with it new ethical, legal, and practical questions of
   117	the nature of "private property," free  and open access to infor-
   118	mation and resources,  and definitions of "authorship." Few among
   119	us condone any form of  predatory behavior.  However,  we find
   120	equally disturbing the tendency to assumptively assert claims and
   121	definitions that rightly  should be brought into  a public forum
   122	for debate rather.   The University has the obligation to protect
   123	the law, but it also has an equal obligation to do so responsibly
   124	without contributing to the  current hysteria surrounding alleged
   125	"computer crime."

   128	The preceding article is from the
   129	Computer Underground Digest Issue #1.03 / File 5 of 6
   130	available on USENET, BITNET, Compuserve, and various other interesting
   131	places.

   133	Gordon and I wrote the following for Northern Illinois University's THE
   134	COMPUTING NEWS. It was not published for two reasons.  First, despite the
   135	fact that our comments are drawn from an on-going research project, it was
   136	considered "opinionated." We were in a catch-22 situation: We were required
   137	to work within severe space constraints, and could present neither data nor
   138	other research citations, yet, we were also advised not to make the article
   139	"too scholarly" for a general audience. Second, and apparently most
   140	important, we were told that if the article were published, it would appear
   141	to violate the NIU policy, so was inappropriate. Only through the most
   142	adept feat of intellectual aerobics could such an interpretation be made,
   143	because we were then, and our article is quite explicit that, in no way
   144	opposing the policy, but only the rhetoric in which it was presented. Our
   145	goal was to debate the rhetoric, not the policy. Such a rationale strikes us
   146	as the CHILLING EFFECT that has occured because of recent hysteria
   147	surrounding alleged computer abuses, and we find it quite ironic that a
   148	University, normally the cornerstone of debate, seems to be stifling debate
   149	on this issue. So, we present it here instead.
   150	
   151	We have seen an earlier version of this article floating around on bulletin
   152	boards, but this is the final, "official," version.
