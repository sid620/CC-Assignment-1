     1	DALLAS, October 15, 1991 ... The ARCNET Trade Association (ATA) has
     2	petitioned the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for approval
     3	of the ATA's "ARCNET Local Area Network Standard" as an ANSI standard.
     4	
     5	ATA officials say should the process continue its present course, final
     6	adoption of the standard by ANSI's executive committee should take place
     7	by late 1991 or early 1992. The ATA, which has been approved by ANSI as a
     8	standards developing body, is in the midst of ANSI's canvass process to
     9	obtain approval of the ARCNET protocol as a U.S. standard.
    10	
    11	The ARCNET Standard was generated under documented, strict adherence to due
    12	process rules of committee review and consensus standards development
    13	customarily used by standards-developing bodies. Participation in the
    14	process was open to all ATA members and others having direct and material
    15	interest in the standard. Before announced review meetings, drafts were
    16	circulated to all members. During the meetings, all comments were
    17	discussed, resolved, and documented for inclusion in the subsequent
    18	revision.
    19	
    20	Revision 1.6--the version which has been circulated in the ANSI canvass
    21	process--was approved by the ATA board which authorized the document to be
    22	published for dissemination to interested LAN technology users.
    23	
    24	ARCNET, which was introduced in 1977, today is supported by more than 50
    25	supplied and has an installed base approaching four million nodes in more
    26	than 300,000 networks. Most manufacturers offer ARCNET products under
    27	their proprietary names, giving ARCNET a low profile in its thousands of
    28	office and factory floor applications. Currently, between 750,000 and one
    29	million ARCNET nodes are being shipped annually for installation in tens
    30	of thousands of networks.
    31	
    32	The ATA is a not-for-profit organization formed in 1987 to increase
    33	visibility, support and development of this widely-installed LAN
    34	technology.
    35	
    36	Copies of the standard are available from the ATA office at the address
    37	below. The non-member price is $75, and the member price is $55. There is
    38	an additional $10 charge for shipping and handling.
