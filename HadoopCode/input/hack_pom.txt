     3	                               Casey at the Byte
     4	                  (with apologies to Ernest Lawrence Thayer)

     6	
     7	The meeting at the White House
     8	     Wasn't going well that day;
     9	The budget plan was lost,
    10	     Thus causing ulcers and dismay;
    11	And when Jones failed at the keyboard
    12	     And Kowalski proved a dud,
    13	One could sense some great disaster,
    14	     Like an avalanche or flood. 
    15	
    16	
    17	"Don't panic," said the President,
    18	     "Don't blab it to the press;
    19	"It's true without the budget plan
    20	     "The country's in a mess;
    21	"Two other 'aces' failed so far
    22	     "To find just where it is,
    23	"And so I've summoned Casey -
    24	     "With computers he's a whiz."
    25	
    26	
    27	A gasp was heard as Casey
    28	     Made his entrance on the scene;
    29	'Twas clear that he was just a lad
    30	     No older than sixteen;
    31	And yet despite his lack of years,
    32	     One fact outshone the rest -
    33	As a trouble-shooting "hacker"
    34	     His credentials were the best.
    35	
    36	
    37	He boasted a degree from Yale,
    38	     Plus two from M.I.T.;
    39	His work with "backup," "RAM" and "track"
    40	     was marvelous to see;
    41	The range of his computer skills
    42	     Was hailed both near and far
    43	From Commodore to IBM
    44	     From Wang to NCR.
    45	
    46	
    47	There was ease in Casey's manner
    48	     As he entered his commands;
    49	One could sense some mighty power
    50	     Was contained within his hands.
    51	With lightning speed his fingers moved
    52	     To press each crucial key;
    53	"The budget plan exists," he said.
    54	     "it cannot hide from me."
    55	
    56	
    57	
    58	
    59	
    60	
    61	
    62	With great persistence Casey toiled,
    63	     And yet, upon the screen,
    64	No buried data came to light
    65	     From in the great machine,
    66	Except for birthday greetings
    67	     To a Congressman in Maine,
    68	Two vetos and a slogan
    69	     From the '84 campaign.
    70	
    71	
    72	The strain now shows in Casey's eyes;
    73	     He's aged a dozen years;
    74	But then, at last, to joyful shouts,
    75	     The budget plan appears!
    76	And now he lifts his head in pride,
    77	     A smile upon his face;
    78	And now the mood is shattered
    79	     As his elbow hits "ERASE."
    80	
    81	
    82	Oh, somewhere there are nations
    83	     Where the keenest minds prevail,
    84	Where budgets can be balanced
    85	     And the experts never fail;
    86	And somewhere data's safely stored,
    87	     Preserved beyond a doubt,
    88	But no plan can save the White House -
    89	     Klutz Casey wiped it out.
