     3	AIDS TROJAN MARCHES ON
     4	
     5	LONDON - It has been almost three
     6	months since infected Aids Information
     7	disks started landing on user's desks.
     8	Despite the high level of publicity,
     9	users continue to ignore the warnings
    10	install the disk and allowing the Trojan
    11	to continue causing damage.
    12	
    13	UK-based detective Barry Donovan predicts
    14	there will be users who will install the
    15	disk and then forget about it until it
    16	triggers after 90 or so reboots.  For 
    17	some users, those 90 reboots are now
    18	up.

    20	A representative from Michelin Tyres
    21	in Nigeria contacted PC Business World,
    22	UK, to request a Clearaid disk because the
    23	virus had just triggerd on his home PC.  He
    24	said a significantly large number of disks
    25	are in circulation in West Africa.
    26	
    27	The US arm of Save the Children Fund offices
    28	in Ethiopia also became a victim of the
    29	blackmail attempt having PC's "wiped out
    30	by the Trojan".  Other US-based charities
    31	with offices in the African continent have
    32	reported similar attacks, despite local 
    33	media coverage and warning issued by 
    34	charities, local police forces, and wide area 
    35	networks like Usenet.
    36	
    37	Joseph Popp, whom FBI agents arrested in 
    38	connection with the mailing, is still being
    39	held in an Ohio prison awaiting extradition
    40	proceedings.  He has made a second court
    41	appearance to appeal against his continued
    42	detention in order to be medically examined.
    43	The court, however, ruled such assessments
    44	should be conducted in prison.  According to
    45	Scotland Yard, Popp's extradition hearing will
    46	be held in early April.
