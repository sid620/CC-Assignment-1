     1	BOSTON, Feb. 11, 1992, NetWorld Booth #4703 -- Anco Corporation today
     2	expanded its family of Ethernet LAN products with two notebook and laptop
     3	computer parallel port adapters, 8- and 16-bit NetWare compatible network
     4	interface cards (NICs) and an 8-port hub. All five products are designed
     5	for applications requiring highly reliable networking products that are
     6	also economical to implement.

     8	Parallel Port Adapters for Notebook to Network Communication
     9	
    10	Anco is one of few manufacturers offering parallel port adapters that allow
    11	PC notebook and laptop computers to simultaneously access a local printer
    12	and communicate with the network. Unlike standard competitive solutions
    13	that feature only two ports, the E-NET 10Base-T and ENET Coax (10Base-2)
    14	parallel port adapters provide four connectors; a DB25 male connector for
    15	attachment to a laptop, a DB25 pass-through port for attachment to a local
    16	printer or other parallel-port peripheral, a DB15 port for Thicknet
    17	connection and either an RJ45 port or a BNC port for 10Base-T or 10Base-2
    18	applications respectively.
    19	
    20	"With the emergence of the laptop market, network demands have changed and
    21	Anco is dedicated to providing reliable low-cost solutions" said John
    22	Koon, director of product marketing. "Users come in from the field and
    23	want to connect with their company's network to download data, check their
    24	E-Mail, etc. They also want to conveniently print their output for the day
    25	from a local printer or back up their laptop hard drive. New parallel port
    26	peripherals are being announced every day and Anco's parallel port
    27	adapters provide affordable and convenient access to these local devices
    28	while simultaneously allowing communication with the network."
    29	
    30	Anco's compact E-NET 10Base-T and E-NET Coax also feature proprietary
    31	optimized software drivers for Novell NetWare compatibility, LEDs to
    32	monitor collision, activity and link status for easy diagnostics and slim
    33	packaging (7"x6.25"x1.5"). The adapters are affordably priced at more than
    34	40 percent below that of competitive products offered by such companies as
    35	Xircom.
    36	
    37	The Anco E-NET 10Base-T and E-NET Coax parallel port adapters are now
    38	available in sample quantities. Production units will be available in
    39	March and retail at a list price of $345. Anco's parallel port adapters
    40	comply with the IEEE 802.3 standard and carry a two-year warranty.
    41	
    42	NE-1000 and NE-2000 Compatible NICs are Built in America
    43	
    44	Anco's new adapter cards, the E-NET 10Base-T NE-1000 and NE-2000 compatible
    45	NICs, also provide a low-cost solution for network communication between
    46	8-bit (PC/XT/AT bus) and 16-bit (286/386 bus) workstations respectively.
    47	Both products are socketed for remote boot ROM for use with diskless
    48	workstations. Designed and manufactured in the United States, these
    49	products feature the National Semiconductor ST-NIC chip to provide a
    50	highly reliable yet affordable networking alternative in comparison to
    51	competitive offerings.
    52	
    53	The E-NET 10Base-T NE-1000 and NE-2000 compatible NICs are available and
    54	retail at a list price of $170 and $180 respectively. The new Anco NICs
    55	comply with the IEEE 802.3 standard and carry a two-year warranty.
    56	
    57	8-Port Hub for Low-Cost Networking
    58	
    59	Anco's E-NET 10Base-T 8-Port Hub at $50 per port provides a very low-cost
    60	solution for small networks or for users who want an inexpensive way to
    61	expand to sixteen ports with two hubs. Status LEDs show the link status of
    62	each 10Base-T port and include indicators for collision/partition, link
    63	integrity, polarity and traffic. The E-NET 10Base-T 8-Port Hub is
    64	available at a retail price of $450. It complies with the IEEE 802.3
    65	standard and carries a two-year warranty.
    66	
    67	Anco Corporation provides complete networking solutions for
    68	budget-sensitive applications where reliable, high quality communications
    69	are required. Anco manufactures hardware for both Ethernet and Token-Ring
    70	networks. The company has recently expanded its family of products offered
    71	directly to end users under the Anco Corporation label to complement its
    72	OEM sales efforts. Multi-station access units (MAUs), hubs, network
    73	interface cards (NICs), connectors, transceivers, baluns, and filters as
    74	well as cables, and other networking accessories are available from Anco.
    75	Established in 1979, Anco Corporation, based in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif.,
