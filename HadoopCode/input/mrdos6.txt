     1	Hard Disk Management - Level 1:
     2	
     3	DOS    Disk Operating System   (Director Of Services)
     4	---
     5	Master control program for the flow of information within a PC.  One of
     6	its primary functions is to oversee all disk activities -
     7	reading/writing information from/to a disk, and loading/executing
     8	programs.  It controls (links) all hardware devices so they may
     9	communicate with one another including:
    10	
    11	      Floppy Drives:   5.25", 3.5"
    12	        Hard Drives:   10mb, 20mb, .....
    13	           Ram Disk:   Simulates a disk drive from within RAM
    14	         Laser Disk:   "CD's" for computers
    15	Tape Storage Device:   Backup system typically using cassette type
    16	                       tapes
    17	
    18	PLUS,  Screen, Keyboard, Printer, Modem, Mouse, ...
    19	
    20	As if this wasn't enough, this modest software called DOS also keeps
    21	track of the current time and date, and the usage of all memory
    22	locations within RAM.
    23	
    24	
    25	Once DOS has been properly BOOTed, you will see the familiar "DOS
    26	Prompt":
    27	
    28	     A>
    29	
    30	This says:  1. DOS has been properly installed
    31	            2. "A" is the default drive
    32	            3. DOS is awaiting your next command
    33	
    34	
    35	HARD DISK DRIVES
    36	----------------
    37	Also called Hard Drive, Hard Cards, Fixed Disk Drives.  Hard Drives are
    38	essentially large floppies housed within the computer.  They are much faster,
    39	much higher capacity, and less likely to fail due to the safe environment from
    40	within which they operate.
    41	
    42	Hard Disk cost is related to its capacity and it Access Time.  Access Time is
    43	the amount of time it take the disk to locate a random piece of information.
    44	Access Time is measured in milliseconds (ms-millionths of a second).  A fast
    45	one would be 28ms, a slow one 65ms.
    46	
    47	
    48	DOS REALITIES
    49	-------------
    50	There are three types of FILES that may be successfully "executed" from
    51	the DOS Prompt:
    52	
    53	    1. *.EXE Commands      ("EXECUTE" Program files  Lotus, dBASE,....)
    54	    2. *.COM Commands      ("COMMAND" Program files  Lotus, dBASE,....)
    55	    3. *.BAT               ("BATCH" Custom programs )
    56	                                                                                
    57	
    58	
    59	
    60	
    61	
    62	
    63	To successfully execute one of the *.EXE, *.COM, or *.BAT  command
    64	files, the file itself must be either:
    65	
    66	          1. In the Current directory
    67	          2. Within a directory that is part of the DOS "PATH" command
    68	
    69	Batch (.BAT) files are the only executable files you can write using a
    70	simple word processor, or DOS's built in Line Editor (EDLIN) - more later.
    71	
    72	BOOTING (or Bootstrap)  To load and execute the Disk Operating System-DOS
    73	-------
    74	This term comes from the phrase "pull yourself up by your own bootstraps".
    75	This happens within a PC when it is turned on.  Actually, a built-in program
    76	(ROM) is executed, then a couple of "hidden" files from the ROOT directory
    77	(hard drive) or DOS Disk (floppy disk), then COMMAND.COM (DOS internal command
    78	interpreter) followed by the Optional CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.
    79	
    80	COMMAND.COM:  Must by loaded for DOS to operate properly, it contains
    81	              the Internal DOS commands - those used most often: Copy,
    82	              Dir, Del, etc.  The remainder of files on the DOS disk
    83	              are called External Files (DISKCOPY, CHKDSK,...).  To
    84	              utilized one of these commands, the DOS disk must be
    85	              accessible.
    86	
    87	CONFIG.SYS:   Optional.  If it is located on the Disk that you are
    88	              BOOTing from, DOS will "open" it and read and interpret a
    89	              list of system configuration commands.  This is a ASCII
    90	              text file which can be created by any text editor.
    91	              Configuration commands include: FILES, BUFFERS,
    92	              DEVICE,...
    93	
    94	AUTOEXEC.BAT: Optional.  An ASCII text file. "Opened" and read after
    95	              CONFIG.SYS, IF it exists on the BOOT disk.  A "batch"
    96	              file.  A set of DOS commands and other special commands.
    97	
    98	
    99	SOME FREQUENTLY USED DOS COMMANDS WITHIN A HARD DISK ENVIRONMENT
   100	----------------------------------------------------------------
   101	A Hard Disk is just like a floppy.  However, due to its size additional file
   102	management commands are needed.  The following can also be used on floppy
   103	disks, but they are most common in Hard Drive Environments.
   104	
   105	INTERNAL  ³   EXTERNAL (Insert DOS in Drive A)
   106	          ³
   107	 MD       ³   CHKDSK
   108	 CD       ³   BACKUP
   109	 RD       ³   RESTORE
   110	 PROMPT   ³   SUBST
   111	 PATH     ³   TREE
   112	
   113	                                                                                
   114	
   115	
   116	
   117	
   118	
   119	**-- Internal DOS Commands -
   120	
   121	MD - Make a directory (see below)
   122	
   123	CD - Change to a directory (see below)
   124	
   125	RD - Remove a directory - must be rid of files first (see below)
   126	
   127	PROMPT $p$g - Changes the way the DOS prompt is display.  $p$g insures that
   128	              the current directory is shown at the prompt.  Very useful.
   129	              Usually "set" in the AUTOEXEC.bat file (see below)
   130	
   131	PATH=c:\DOS;c:\BATCH;c:\UTILITY
   132	
   133	     Sets up a command (*.EXE, *.COM, *.BAT) search path in the DOS
   134	     environment.  When a command is issued from the DOS prompt, it
   135	     first looks in the directory you are currently in, then looks in
   136	     each directory noted on this path.  Usually this command is built
   137	     into the AUTOEXEC.bat file (see below)
   138	
   139	
   140	**-- External DOS Commands -
   141	
   142	
   143	CHKDSK C:\*.*  /F
   144	
   145	  Checks the integrity of disk files - the level of fragmentation of files.
   146	  Indicates the number of files and amount of free storage space remaining on
   147	  the disk in drive A.  It also indicates the amount of RAM storage.
   148	  If any lost clusters are found (data without a home), they can be converted
   149	  to *.CHK files so you can delete them to free up the disk space.
   150	
   151	SUBST  E:  c:\LOTUS\123FILES    - Assigns a 1-letter drive ID to a
   152	                                  directory path
   153	
   154	SUBST E: /D   - Cancel previous designation
   155	
   156	TREE  /F  -  Displays a list of files and directories on the disk.
   157	             /F - more detail - all files, all directories
   158	
   159	BACKUP  (see below)
   160	
   161	RESTORE  (see below)
   162	
   163	
   164	DIRECTORIES
   165	-----------
   166	As previous mentioned, a hard disk is essentially a large floppy disk.
   167	However, it offers some distinct advantages:
   168	
   169	   Is much larger
   170	   Stays inside the machine
   171	   Operates (transfers data) at a much higher rate (5-10x)
   172	                                                                                
   173	
   174	
   175	
   176	
   177	
   178	Because a Hard Disk is so much larger than a floppy, we use an
   179	additional file organization tool called SUBDIRECTORIES.
   180	
   181	If a floppy is like a filing drawer, than a Hard Drive is like a wall
   182	of file drawers, each drawer call a SUBDIRECTORY.
   183	
   184	DOS lets you organize files using tree-structured directories rather than a
   185	single directory.  In other words, since a 20  meg (20,000,000 byte) capacity
   186	hard drive can contain approximately 60  floppy disks worth of files, an
   187	additional organization tool is needed.  The creation of SUBDIRECTORIES allows
   188	us to subdivide a disk to contain related files.  It's as if we have many file
   189	cabinets available to store our files rather than a single giant one.
   190	
   191	DOS permits up to 112 files on a floppy disk.  However, with that many
   192	it is a labor to examine via a DIR and it also slows DOS's file access
   193	and retrieval.
   194	
   195	ROOT DIRECTORY - Main directory - it provides support for all the
   196	SUBDIRECTORIES.  It contains all the SUBDIRECTORIES.
   197	
   198	Each SUBDIRECTORY can contain files as well as other SUBDIRECTORIES.
   199	These other Subdirectories could be thought of as SUB-SUBDIRECTORIES.
   200	
   201	To use a file in a different drive we have specified the drive and
   202	filename (B:Filename.ext).  Similarly, if we want to access a file in a
   203	SUBDIRECTORY we specify a PATH, OR make that SUBDIRECTORY the "current"
   204	one.

   224	PATH:  A PATH specifies the names of the directories that DOS must go
   225	through from the ROOT DIRECTORY to get to the file.  The directories
   226	are separated by a forward slash (  \  ).  (NOT the same as the DOS PATH

   248	DOS & SUBDIRECTORIES  - there are only 3 key commands in dealing with
   249	Subdirectories:  MD, CD, and RD
   250	
   251	TO MAKE A SUBDIRECTORY
   252	----------------------
   253	MD dirspec  - Internal - to MaKe a DIRectory -dirspec is the name of
   254	                         the subdirectory or its PATH
   255	
   256	     EX: C>MD 123FILES  <ENTER>   -  This creates a subdirectory
   257	                                     called 123FILES
   258	
   259	         - Naming a SUBDIRECTORY follows the same rules for
   260	           file naming, except extensions are not used
   261	         - You can created unlimited number of SUBDIRECTORIES
   262	         - Identical Filenames can exist in different SUBs
   263	           (Remember, 2 files with identical filenames CANNOT coexist
   264	            in the same SUBDIRECTORY)
   265	
   266	TO CHANGE THE "CURRENT" SUBDIRECTORY
   267	------------------------------------
   268	The computer can only have 1 "file drawer" open at a time - thus this is
   269	called the current directory.  Unless instructed otherwise, the computer will
   270	assume all files sought and sent will go into this current subdirectory.
   271	
   272	CD\dirspec - to Change the "current" Directory
   273	
   274	   - EX:  C>CD\LOTUS    <ENTER>    -  This makes a subdirectory
   275	                                      called LOTUS the current one
   276	TO REMOVE/ERASE A SUBDIRECTORY
   277	------------------------------
   278	     1. First make this directory the current one C>cd/dirspec
   279	     2. DELETE all the files within this directory
   280	           C>DEL *.*
   281	        It will ask if you are sure - Y
   282	     3. Go to the ROOT DIRECTORY   C>cd\
   283	     4. RD dirspec     - Reove Directory
   284	
   285	              C>RD dirspec
