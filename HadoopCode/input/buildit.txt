    26	      [Ed: Andrew is the brains behind the original Proton Ram boards,
    27	           which are still valued very highly by their owners. He is now
    28	           running his own Amiga-specific hardware manufacturing business
    29	           (on a human scale, with human scale prices, too) and it may not
    30	           be an exaggeration to say that there is little he doesn't know
    31	           about the Amiga in general, and hardware specifically. He
    32	           provides numerous products for all models of the Amiga,
    33	           including 8-meg Ram boards, hard disks, digitisers, real-time
    34	           clocks, and many other products. You'll see below that he
    35	           really knows what he's talking about, and he's always been
    36	           available to me when I have a hardware problem. He can be

    42	           With the expert help of Mario Nicotra, this mod was done to my 
    43	           early (Rev. 5A) A500, and it worked fine - the business of the
    44	           switch from NTSC to PAL screens was done by bending the socket
    45	           of pin 41 of the Agnes chip, perhaps the easiest of the alter-
    46	           natives mentioned by Andrew. Note also that the full details
    47	           required are here: all the docs from the US and even from 
    48	           Commodore here tend to forget to show you how to make the change
    49	           from NTSC to PAL...

    69	  The Obese Agnus Chip.
    70	  ---------------------[0m
    71	   The Obese Agnus Chip (8372A or 318069-02) is the new Agnus chip capable
    72	   of addressing 1 MegaByte of Chip Ram on the A500 or B2000. This allows
    73	   you to have more than TWICE as many windows and screens open than is
    74	   possible with a standard Fat Agnus equipped machine. If opening twice
    75	   as many screens and windows isn't your thing then it also means that
    76	   the Hi-res modes of such programs as Digiview, DeluxePaint and others
    77	   which refuse to run until all extra drives, windows, screens are closed
    78	   will now open and also allow you to run extra flip screens etc. Games
    79	   such as Boulderdash/Emerald Mines which refuse to load unless all
    80	   external drives are disconnected are now much happier as well.
    81	
    82	    Commodore is now shipping the Obese Agnus in most of the current A500s
    83	   (without telling anybody) although Commodore in the USA will admit to
    84	   it when questioned. These A500s are set up in Fat Agnus Mode so that
    85	   even if an A501 board is plugged into them no improvement is obtained
    86	   without further internal modification.

    88	  Obese Agnus Software Compatibility.
    89	  -----------------------------------[0m
    90	   Already 1 animation package (VideoFX 3D I believe) has been found which
    91	   will not run with the 8372A in either Fat or Obese mode. This is a
    92	   problem caused by the programmer reading or writing to registers in the
    93	   Agnus chip in an illegal (non-Commodore approved) manner and may
    94	   (should) be fixed in later releases of the package. CHECK that any
    95	   software that you HAVE to use works with ONE Meg of Chip Ram before
    96	   committing to this upgrade. All other programs tried so far, about
    97	   150, have been completely compatible.
    98	[33m
    99	  Fitting the Obese Agnus to Early A500s.(REV5 Boards)[0m
   100	  ---------------------------------------
   101	   Contrary to a message appearing on many local Bulletin boards it is not
   102	   necessary to have the new Rev 6A board to fit the Obese Agnus to an
   103	   A500.  The 8372A can be fitted to the older Rev 5 boards simply by
   104	   doing the following :
   105	
   106	   1 Remove the Fat Agnus 8371 from its socket (see warning above).
   107	     Check orientation of pin 1 to facilitate installation of 8372A. Pin
   108	     41 of the Agnus socket which is earthed on all REV5 boards controls
   109	     whether the A500 starts up in NTSC or PAL mode. When it is earthed
   110	     the Obese Agnus initialises in NTSC Mode which means that all USA
   111	     owners need to do is plug in the chip and they are in the correct
   112	     mode. We on the other hand have to de-solder and remove the socket
   113	     from the board to isolate pin 41 which is connected to earth on both
   114	     sides of the board. This chip was designed in the USA!! Removing
   115	     the socket is a difficult and laborious task so other methods of
   116	     isolating pin 41 are possible. I DO NOT recommend trying to drill
   117	     through the board as the two pins 41 and 42 are very close together,
   118	     the trace between them is thick and there are thin tracks either side
   119	     of it under the socket on the top of the board. Bending the contact
   120	     on the socket is a possibility but make sure you get it right or
   121	     you'll be removing the socket anyway. Placing a thin piece of hard
   122	     plastic, eg mylar, between the pin and the contact is another
   123	     possibility. By putting a SPST toggleswitch between pin 41 and earth
   124	     it is possible to switch between NTSC and PAL on resetting the
   125	     machine. This would give good compatibility with American software
   126	     and for this reason and others DO NOT just break or cut pin 41 off
   127	     the chip. Pin 41 is taken to a jumper pad on REV6A boards.

   160	
   161	  2  Insert the Obese Agnus 8372A into the socket paying particular
   162	     attention to the orientation. Pin #1 is located in the centre of the
   163	     side immediately clockwise from the beveled corner of the chip and is
   164	     marked by a small dimple. The 8372A should be installed with pin 1
   165	     to the front of the socket. This is marked by a large 1 on the
   166	     silkscreening on the circuit board just above the words "FAT AGNUS".
   167	     I overstress this point because this is an expensive chip and a
   168	     wrongly inserted chip which has had power applied to it probably has
   169	     a value of 0000 dollars. The socket on the REV6A boards has been
   170	     rotated 90 degrees anticlockwise. BE WARNED!!
   171	
   172	  3  Locate the jumper JP2 on the circuit board to the right of the 68000
   173	     chip.  Cut the trace between the centre and lower pads carefully with
   174	     a sharp knife. Join the centre and upper pads with a small piece of
   175	     light wire.  This jumper changes the address of the A501 board or
   176	     equivalent from C00000H to 080000H to make it contiguous with the
   177	     first 512K of memory to give a 1MEG block of chip ram. The three
   178	     pads of JP2 can be wired to a SPDT toggleswitch to allow changing
   179	     from one memory location to the other if there is any software
   180	     incompatibility with the new setup.
   181	
   182	  4  Pin 32 of the GARY chip (located above right of the Agnus socket)
   183	     must be open circuit for this upgrade to work. This pin is the
   184	     *EXRAM signal which is normally earthed by the A501 board when it is
   185	     plugged into the A500. Several methods of achieving this are
   186	     available as follows:
   187	
   188	       a. If you have installed one of my A501 memory disable switches
   189	          or other similar modification which open circuits pin 32 of the
   190	          A501 memory expansion connector then this will serve the
   191	          purpose. Leave it in the OFF position and disregard the rest of
   192	          section 4.
   193	
   194	       b. Locate the GARY chip and remove from its socket. Locate pin 32
   195	          and CAREFULLY bend it slightly outwards so that when GARY is put
   196	          back in its socket pin 32 does not go into its socket. Return
   197	          the GARY chip to the socket making sure that it is correctly
   198	          positioned ie. pin 1 and notch to the right hand side. Pin 32
   199	          can be connected through a SPST toggleswitch to earth to
   200	          preserve compatability with the Fat Agnus.

   246	     of Chip Ram and no Fast Ram on a 1MEG A500. Now try loading a
   247	     picture, The Tiger on Megadisc 5 is most suitable, repeatedly. It
   248	     should be possible to load more than twice as many as before (about 8
   249	     as against 3 I think from memory).

   253	  The NEW REV6A 500 Board.
   254	  ------------------------[0m
   255	   This board has been shipped by Commodore for approx. 2 to 3 months.
   256	   The main reason for the change has been to allow Commodore to use the
   257	   newer 1 Megabit chips and to allow for 1 megabyte of memory on the main
   258	   board. This means that the A501 board is no longer needed if the extra
   259	   512K is installed on the main board. Current cost of this upgrade is
   260	   approximately $160.00 . If the Real Time Clock is needed then clock
   261	   boards plugging into the A501 slot are available for $50-60. There is
   262	   provision for several resistor packs on the board although they are not
   263	   fitted and their use is not clear. The change has little to do with
   264	   the Obese Agnus upgrade although it is a little easier to fit to a
   265	   REV6A board. The board also contains several new jumper pads, details
   266	   of which are given below.

   296	  (A Week Later)
   297	   As can be seen from the above table most of these new jumpers are for
   298	   convenience and do not represent radical improvements over the previous
   299	   board.
   300	
   301	
   302	    Conversion of a REV6A board to work with Obese Agnus is fairly simply
   303	   and will be covered in a later article which will also cover fitting
   304	   the extra 512K of RAM to the main board.

   307	 The Different Types of A500s and Identifying Them.
   308	 ---------------------------------------------------[0m
   309	
   310	    This section does not attempt to identify the different types of disk
   311	   drives, keyboards etc. which, particularly in the case of the A500,
   312	   seem to change almost weekly.
   313	
   314	  The A500.
   315	           The base model of the range which, contrary to what B2000
   316	           salesman say, is expandable to Approx. 15 Meg of RAM, Hard
   317	           Drives, etc.  Somewhat limited power supply so a larger one is
   318	           needed for hard drives.
   319	
   320	   There are two basic types :
   321	
   322	        A. The original REV5 board supplied from the beginning up until
   323	           early 1989. Requires the A501 Board or equivalent for
   324	           expansion to 1 Meg and use of Obese Agnus.
   325	
   326	        B. The new REV6A board supplied from April/May 1989 on. The way to
   327	           recognise it is to check the expansion bus connector on the
   328	           left hand side of the computer. You'll notice that the early
   329	           model A500 has a "fat finger" metal strip at the back end of
   330	           the connector - the new A500 doesn't, instead it has two thin
   331	           "fingers", ie, 2 metal strips in the corresponding place, of
   332	           the same width as the rest of the strips of the connector.
   333	
   334	
   335	    More on this and other related matters in the next issue.
   336	
   337	
   338	    2000 MODIFICATION
   339	
   340	    Ed: The modification for the A2000 is pretty similar, and has been 
   341	    done by Mario (mentioned above) on a very souped-up system. Keeping
   342	    in mind all the warnings and hints above, it goes like this:
   343	
   344	    A. Remove computer cover, floppy cable (noting position of the red
   345	       wire on the cable), power plug from connectror CN400, and power
   346	       supply and drive assembly from the main unit.
   347	
   348	    B. Remove the old slimmer Agnes as above, preferably using a chip
   349	       extractor. Insert the new chip with the right alignment.
   350	
   351	    C. Find Jumper J101 located on the lower right side of the power 
   352	       connector CN400, and consists of 3 posts - 2 of the posts are 
   353	       shorted together using a shorting block. Remove the shorting block
   354	       and move it to the left, towards the power connector. For further
   355	       info, see Page 13 of the A2000 system schematics - this jumper
   356	       will enable address line 19 from the 68000 which controls the 1 
   357	       meg address range.
   358	
   359	    D. Locate and cut Jumper pad J500 (to the lower left of the 8520 at
   360	       U301). This is a 2-pad jumper with a trace connecting the two 
   361	       pads. See Page 9 of the A2000 system schematics - cutting this
   362	       trace keeps the _EXRAM signal from being tied to ground.
   363	
   364	    E. Finally, to enable PAL rather than NTSC - locate and cut J102, 
   365	       NOT J201 as suggested in some docs. This is the equivalent of 
   366	       bending pin 41 of Agnes in the A500 mod.
   367	
   368	
   369	       The mod is now finished, so re-assemble the unit, power up and
   370	       hope for the best! And don't attempt it unless, as mentioned 
   371	       above, you're very adept at electronics hacking. Show these docs
   372	       to such a person, however, and there should be little difficulty.

   389	    Several of my friends who are Amiga owners have had problems with the
   390	   internal drive. This modification will overcome that problem by
   391	   allowing Amiga 500 owners to boot from df1:.
   392	
   393	    This mod is also useful for people who own the Commodore 5 1/4 inch
   394	   drives and wish to boot from them. More importantly, people who have
   395	   added an 80trk 5 1/4 inch drive (such as myself) as described in the
   396	   file ADD_5.25_DRIVE can boot from it. As 5 1/4 inch disks can be
   397	   bought for as low as $5.95 for 10 in some places, it is well worth
   398	   considering as a cheap backup library option OR indeed as an
   399	   alternative primary storage medium.
   400	
   401	      You will need the following tools and parts:
   402	
   403	      * Low wattage soldering iron, suitable for PCB's
   404	      * DPDT switch mini toggle variety is fine
   405	      * 1 foot of ribbon cable
   406	      * solder
   407	      * small snippers
   408	      * hand drill
   409	      * tool to unscrew the @#$%^& non-standard case screws
   410	      * Exacto knife or similar
   411	
   412	    Start by unscrewing the 6 hex style screws around the edge of the
   413	   case (Goodbye warranty!).  Do not remove the three phillips screws as
   414	   they are holding the drive in place.  Turn the machine back the right
   415	   way up and remove the lid by pressing around the edge to ease off the
   416	   catches.  Remove the keyboard making careful note of the orientation of
   417	   the connector on the main board!!!!!  Now remove the further 4 hex
   418	   screws which are holding the top rf shield in place and remove the
   419	   shield.  Unplug the disk drive POWER cable from the drive end only.
   420	
   421	    Remove the 34-way disk drive patch lead taking note of its orientation
   422	   (This saves so much time when you have forgotten later on!)  Unscrew
   423	   the Disk drive unit and remove it.
   424	
   425	    The main PC board should now come free with the lower RF shield.
   426	   Unscrew the hexagonal socket retainers on the I/O connectors at the
   427	   rear of the board and this shield should come free.
   428	
   429	    You are now ready to start!
   430	
   431	    Locate connector 11 (CN11) on the component side, this is the socket
   432	   that you just unplugged the disk drive patch lead from.  In front of it
   433	   should be U8 which is an 8520 chip.
   434	
   435	    CN11 is 2 rows of 34 pins.Count along the front row from the right
   436	   hand side until you see the 5th and 6th pins (pins 9 and 11 of the
   437	   connector respectively).  There should be two circuit traces that lead
   438	   from these pins and disappear under U8.  Using the exacto knife cut
   439	   both of these traces leaving no stray copper. A 1mm cut should be
   440	   sufficient.
   441	
   442	    Turn the board over to the solder side.
   443	    Leave the board for a moment and get the DPDT switch.
   444	    For ease I will label its pins as such:
   445	
   446	        A   B
   447	
   448	        C   D
   449	
   450	        E   F
   451	
   452	    Cut a piece of ribbon cable about 1' long with 4 conductors.
   453	    Strip and tin the wires then connect them to A, B, C and D.
   454	    Cut two small pieces of wire and connect A-F and E-B.
   455	
   456	    Tin and strip the other ends of the ribbon cable.Using the snippers
   457	   trim these tinned ends until there is about 1 1/2 to 2mm showing. Any
   458	   longer is unnecessary and can lead to solder blobs etc.
   459	
   460	    Grab the Amiga pc board again. On the solder side locate pins 9 and
   461	   11 of CN11 as described earlier. Solder the lead from A to pin 9 and
   462	   the lead from B to pin 11.
   463	
   464	    Locate pins 13 and 14 of U8.
   465	
   466	    If you are unsure of pin numbering on IC's refer to one of the data
   467	   sections of DSE's or ROD Irving catalogues.  Otherwise looking at the
   468	   chip there is a notch at the right hand end of the board. Pin 1 is
   469	   behind this notch (relative to the pc board) and the numbers increase
   470	   in an anti-clockwise fashion around the chip.  Solder the lead from C
   471	   to pin 13 of U8 and the lead from D to pin 14 of U8.  That completes
   472	   the soldering side of things.
   473	
   474	    All that remains is to drill a hole for the switch and put the rest
   475	   back together. There is a convenient spot to the right of the joystick
   476	   socket that will house 3 or 4 switches comfortably.
   477	
   478	    PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE be careful of the orientation of the connectors
   479	   when assembling your amiga.
   480	
   481	    To use the mod:
   482	             1. Remove ALL disks from ALL drives.
   483	             2. Flick the switch to the NORMAL position.
   484	             3. Turn the machine ON or reset if already ON.
   485	             4. If you wish to boot from drive DF1: now is the time to
   486	                flick the switch to the NON-standard position.
   487	             5. Insert the appropriate disks in the appropriate drives.
   488	
   489	    HOW it works.
   490	   The mod works by switching the drive select lines SEL_0 and SEL_1.
   491	   SIMPLE!
   492	[33m
   493	    IMPORTANT:!![0m
   494	   The switch must be in the NORMAL position when you either turn the
   495	   machine on or reset.The reason for this is that after a cold or warm
   496	   boot the KERNEL roms go looking for what equipment is connected to the
   497	   system. A part of the GARY chip which is triggered by the SEL_0 signal
   498	   provides seperate MOTOR_ON signals for the internal and external
   499	   drives. When the switch is in the ALTERED position the GARY chip is
   500	   fed by the SEL_1 signal and surprise surprise! the KERNEL roms won't
   501	   find the internal drive!  However is is PERFECTLY safe to change the
   502	   switch at ANY time the power is on (without disks in the drives!). So
   503	   if the switch is changed after the roms have found what drives are
   504	   online, the drives 0 and 1 will operate fine only reversed.  More
   505	   circuitry could have been added to swap the motor_on signals so that
   506	   this extra switching wasn't required, however most people would
   507	   probably like to keep their mods to the main pcb to a MINIMUM!
   508	[33m
   509	    *NOTE*[0m
   510	   If the switch is changed while disks are inserted in the drives,
   511	   AmigaDOS will become confused as to what volumes are on line and if
   512	   your write-protect tags are OFF, chances are your directories will be
   513	   CLOBBERED!!
   514	
   515	    The mod is relatively simple, however if you are unsure of your
   516	   ability to perform it.. DON'T. get some hardware oriented person to
   517	   help or drop me a line at PARAGON bbs if in Sydney, or via Megadisc and
   518	   I may be able to help or do it for you at a small nominal cost.
   519	   Naturally I cannot guarantee your labour content so therefore I cannot
   520	   make any warranties, implied or otherwise, as to the suitability or
   521	   performance of this modification.  However I can say that I am not too
   522	   worried about my software collection as I have a set of bootable 5 1/4"
   523	   backups!!
   524	
   525	    Good luck and I hope that this is of some help.

   533				AUDIO BOOST ON THE AMIGA 500
   534	----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   535	This hardware hack is not advanced and gives you a much higher volume out
   536	of your Amiga (With good quality!)
   537	
   538	First remove the screws (This will destroy your warrenty!) from the Amiga
   539	shell (even the screws for the drive!) now carefully open your Amiga,
   540	There are some pigs holding the shell at it's place so don't break those!
   541	(as i have!)   Now remove the screws from the metallic shield and gently
   542	remove the keyboard cable! (Remember the direction the connector are!)
   543	now remove the drive! (Yet another time remember how it was connected!)
   544	now find the filter (LF347) near this circuit you find the condensators
   545	at 22uF (you will actually find two!) the condensators are named C334 and
   546	C324 and two resitors named R334 and R324 now take a dual switch and connect
   547	it like this:
   548	
   549			SWITCH:
   550	
   551	    +------------1  4------+
   552	    |                      |
   553	    | +----------2  5----+ |
   554	    | |                  | |

   559	    +--  R334            |
   560				 + R324
   561	
   562	And now you can boost more sound of ya Amiga, but be carefull you can
   563	destroy
   564	your speekers if ya pump up the volume too much!
   565	(The level meter on my gettoblaster goes to max if i turn on my boost)
   566	
   567	I must say that if your Amiga brakes down cause of this little hardware hack
   568	then don't blame me!
   569	
   570	And if you are not good at soldering then let someone else do it! (even if
   571	the soldering on this hack is really easy!) and DON'T USE A HIGH WATTAGE
   572	SOLDER IRON! (MAX 25 WATT)

   582	right side, I don't know where it's on the 2000!) solder a wire on pin 17
   583

   620	Thats it!   It's not dangerous to pause the computer as some guys thinks
   621	Even if it can look strange sometimes (even crash sometimes) but that
   622	depends how the programmer have done some things! (like showing bitmaps
   623	and so on!)
   624	
   625	The DMA is not stopped with this pause so for example sounds and copperlist
   626	will go on on the Amiga (not musics like soundtracker then just the sounds
   627	will go on but no new will come cause it's a little program but the
   628	processor is halted so no new data will come!)
   629	
   630	This feature can be good if you reads for example a scrolltext and the
   631	phone is ringing then you just have to pause or if you want to check
   632	how some guys have made some effects in a proggy
   633	
   634	If you are not good at soldering let someone who is good to solder in your
   635	computer!
   636	
   637	AND DON'T USE A SOLDER IRON WITH A HIGHER WATTAGE OF 25 WATT!!!

   713	
   714	   all odd numbered pins of the 34 pin connector should be tied to pins
   715	   3, 4, 5, 6 & 7 of the 23 Pin connector (grounds).
   716	
   717	
   718	    In addition, pin 11 of the 23 pin connector should be wired to a
   719	   momentary push-button that can be activated whenever a diskette is
   720	   removed and replaced with another.  This tells the DOS that a different
   721	   diskette has been inserted into the drive.  Simply change the diskette,
   722	   push the button and hold until DOS accesses the drives.  The switch may
   723	   then be released.  This function is necessary due to the fact that the
   724	   DOS seems to read the directory of the current diskette into ram, and
   725	   unless the DOS is told of another diskette being used, it will either
   726	   ask you to replace the diskette that was in the drive or write to the
   727	   diskette using parameters from the previous disk.  This, of course, is
   728	   very undesirable.
   729	
   730	
   731	    Also, note that the drive must be connected when booting DOS or it
   732	   will not be noted as being on-line.  The diskette does not have to be
   733	   inserted, just the drive plugged in.
   734	
   735	
   736	    Do not make any connections to the 23 pin connector, pins 23 or pin
   737	   12.  These pins provide power to the Amiga drive 1 and may not be used
   738	   to power an external 5 1/4" drive.  An external power supply must be
   739	   used.
   740	
   741	
   742	    The 5 1/4" drive selection header may be programmed as drive for drive
   743	   2.  Drive 1 selects as DF2: and drive 2 selects as DF3:.
   744	
   745	
   746	    A motor on latch circuit may be built to eliminate the motor
   747	   continuously turning, however, the way indicated above is the quickest
   748	   and simplest method to get another drive on-line.
   749	
   750	
   751	    After this procedure is completed, the 5 1/4" drive may be used just
   752	   as any normal Amiga drive.
   753	
   754	
   755	    Considering the $295.00 list price of the Amiga drives, versus about
   756	   $50 dollar price of 5 1/4" drives, it's a real bargain.
   757

   759	    *** As always, with any hardware project -
   760	    (1) - if you are not sure of what I am talking about, get
   761	   knowledgeable help and
   762	    (2) - TRIPLE CHECK your work before plugging in the new drive.
