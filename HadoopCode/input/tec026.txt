    27	    exit.
    28	 
    29	 6. Type the following:     INSTALL

    44	13. The Install program will reboot your computer after the
    45	    drive has been created.  Change to C:\STACKER  
    46	
    47	14. Type :      SREMOVE D: 
    48	    This will remove the temporary D: drive.
    49	
    50	15. Edit the Config.sys on drive C: to remove the reference to 
    51	    the temporary D drive. The line should read as follows:
