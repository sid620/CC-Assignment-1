     3	Timo's subjective choice of best PD & SW MS-DOS early material
     4	--------------------------------------------------------------
     5	
     6	Not surprisingly many of the selections that were on my earlier
     7	versions of the best programs list BESTPROG.TXT were utilities that
     8	complemented what the earlier MS-DOS versions lacked. I have moved
     9	the consequently outdated selections in here.
    10	
    11	ask.exe         The most important command originally missing from
    12	                MS-DOS batch programming. Ask comes under many names
    13	                and has been rewritten by countless programmers.
    14	                Also I have written my own in ftp://garbo.uwasa.fi
    15	                /pc/ts/tsbat47.zip. The basic idea of asks is to
    16	                prompt the user for a choice, and return an
    17	                errorlevel (or sometimes put a value to an
    18	                environment variable), which then can be used for a
    19	                conditional jump in the batch in accordance with the
    20	                user's choice. My own ask uses the most common ask
    21	                standard of returning as the errorlevel the ASCII
    22	                number of the first letter of the user's response,
    23	                but I also have written an errorlevel version. It is
    24	                interesting that MicroSoft finally succumbed and
    25	                introduced a similar command in MS-DOS 6.0 calling
    26	                it CHOICE. You can find a choice clone choose.exe in
    27	                tsutlf15.zip if you don't have MS-DOS version 6+.
    28	                Furthermore, although little known, ordinary batch
    29	                programming can be used to input the user's response
    30	                to an environment variable, as explained in
    31	                tsbat47.zip.
    32	
    33	ced10da.zip     Command line editor. This facility lets the user to
    34	                recall earlier commands, edit the commands, make
    35	                aliases (synonyms) for the commands, and optionally
    36	                ignore commands. CED is old, but still extremely
    37	                useful as such even compared DOSKEY which was
    38	                introduced with MS-DOS 5.0. Don't go without it, or
    39	                some other good, alternative command line editor.
    40	                Despite being old, CED still often features on the
    41	                best program lists of many computer magazines. The
    42	                one feature CED unfortunately lacks is file name
    43	                completion present in some other command line
    44	                editors. The later versions of CED have gone
    45	                commercial, as far as I know. For other
    46	                alternatives, like command line editors with file
    47	                name completion, see Garbo's /pc/cmdutil directory.
    48	
    49	dirw.exe        From my own ftp://garbo.uwasa.fi/pc/ts/tsutil41.zip
    50	                utility collection. It is like MS-DOS dir /w, but it
    51	                also shows the file attributes, and it can be made
    52	                to recurse all the directories. I use it on a daily
    53	                basis to have a backup list of what my hard disks
    54	                contain. It is vindicative to note that in DOS 5.0
    55	                the new DIR command was endowed among other things
    56	                with abilities what my dirw already had. Yet
    57	                dirw.exe still has a feature which the MS-DOS dir
    58	                curiously lacks (at least in MS-DOS 5.0). My
    59	                dirw.exe displays the size of a disk also if it has
    60	                no files.
    61	
    62	keyrate.exe     From my own ftp://garbo.uwasa.fi/pc/ts/tsutld22.zip
    63	                utility collection. What it effectively does is that
    64	                it speeds up the cursor movement. An absolute
    65	                necessity because the slow default keyrepeat rate
    66	                makes moving the cursor a real pain in the neck.
    67	                Mostly found only in commercial packages. Haven't
    68	                seen many shareware or PD "competitors", but I may
    69	                be too "optimistic". MS-DOS 5.0 finally introduced
    70	                this feature into the MODE command, which goes to
    71	                show that the idea was a good one. - On MS-DOS 3.3 I
    72	                have in my autoexec.bat "keyrate 0 0". In 5.0 (and
    73	                6.0) I use "mode con: rate=30 delay=1". Since some
    74	                programs (e.g. Windows) alter the typemaatic rate, I
    75	                also have "doskey fast=mode con: rate=32 delay=1" in
    76	                my AUTOEXEC.BAT.

    78	tlb-v252.zip    The Last Byte MS-DOS Upper Memory Manager by Dan
    79	                Lewis. It enables loading device drivers and TSRs to
    80	                high memory. Such a utility becomes a practical
    81	                necessity when the number of memory-hungry TSRs
    82	                grows, as happened on my late MS-DOS 3.30 office 386
    83	                where I had, for example, a network driver to
    84	                connect to our department's laser printer. None of
    85	                the upper memory managers are simple to use, but
    86	                Dan's is not prohibitively difficult as some others.
    87	                At the time of first introducing this list Dan was
    88	                upgrading to 2.00 with a new user interface. (I was
    89	                of the beta testers, and I don't accept such a task
    90	                easily because of my own time limitations). Last
    91	                Byte is a typical example of a utility grown out of
    92	                deficiencies of the earlier MS-DOS versions. The
    93	                upper memory management was finally introduced in
    94	                MS-DOS 5.0 with the all important power user's
    95	                LOADHIGH command. Dan has a mailing list on Internet
    96	                for TLB users. Last Byte still is a fine program,
    97	                but has naturally lost practially all its edge with
    98	                the introduction of MS-DOS' own memory management in
    99	                version 5.0. But it qualifies on the list "for fine
   100	                services rendered". As far as I understand, Dan has
   101	                decided to give up maintaing the progra,
