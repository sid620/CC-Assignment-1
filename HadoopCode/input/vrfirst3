     9	The Virtual Reality section here in the Computer Art Forum has now been opened
    10	for public use. John Eagan [76130,2225] is the section leader.
    11	
    12	The goal of this section is to create, much as the fractals group in area 15
    13	have, a virtual reality system that can be used on personal computers that are
    14	readily available. Based on the response I have seen to my public request for
    15	interested people, and the experience that the people who have contacted me
    16	have should make this easily possible.

    30	The timing for opening this section is just great... my PowerGlove and Sega
    31	3D glasses projects are just now starting give results.  This will be great
    32	place to swap notes with others playing (er, working) with the same things.
    33	 
    34	It's going to be tough to figure out exactly where to post messages, though,
    35	when a project involves an Amateur doing a Raytraced 3-D Animation.  (Such
    36	troubles I can live with!)

    47	Mike- Post them here! Welcome to the section, your message is the first
    48	"non-official" one in the section! How does it feel to be a pioneer?<g> 
    49	Anything of interest you have, let's see it. The funny thing is, the nature of
    50	the subject here inherently means that a lot of boundaries will be crossed, so
    51	don't pick too many nits about "does it really belong here", especially until
    52	things start taking direction. We can sort that stuff out after some things
    53	are on the table, as it were.

    64	
    65	Hello, and welcome to the Virtual Reality section of COMART, our newest
    66	section. I've been drafted as the section head, and hope to be able to help
    67	guide things along as we work on bringing VR to personal computers in the way
    68	FRACTINT and DKB and VIVID have brought fractals and raytracing within the
    69	grasp of people with basic DOS machines. All suggestions are welcome. I've
    70	uploaded a basic introduction to the section as VRINTRO.ZIP / VRINTRO.DOC .
    71	Take a look at it and fire away!
    72	        For a start, it appears that people are working on interfaces for the
    73	Mattel "Power Glove",if you have any source code and/or executable files for
    74	such an interface, or anything else relevant to virtual reality, let's see it.
    75	As things progress we plan to get a work group started somewhat along the same
    76	philosophy as the the now-legendary<g>   "Stone Soup Group.  I propose that we
    77	use C as the standard language for our project (projects?) because of its
    78	popularity, somewhat modular nature, and the fact that I have TurboC++ !
    79	Obviously, for reasons of speed, assembler code will probably be necessary at
    80	some point, but that should work out fine with the assembler routines compiled
    81	into .OBJ files. Myself, I'm a real novice programmer, so if anyone feels up
    82	to the challenge of heading up a project, step right up and announce yourself.
    83	My role will be to act as a coordinator and director,   mostly; in fact, my
    84	hope is to be able to get things rolling to the point where I can sit back and
    85	concentrate on "overview" mode. Hope to hear from all of you. Let's have some
    86	fun in cyberspace!

   135	Mike,
   136	speaking of 3D glasses, I take it you are talking about the LCD shutter type?
   137	I would very much like find out about such things (like how much they cost,
   138	where do I get them, how they hook up to a PC, how I talk to them etc). What
   139	I really want to do is write an interface for them into fractint, the 3D
   140	stuff in fractint fascinates me, but I just can't see the 3D effect from
   141	red/blue images, other approaches work great though (such as polarization).

   192	First non-official message, eh?  It was quite by accident, actually.  I was
   193	poking around in the libs and couldn't remember where to find 3D images.
   194	When I asked for the section names I saw "Virtual Reality" listed, and
   195	cursed myself for not paying more attention to the Forum Announcements and
   196	missing out on all the fun.
   197	 
   198	Come to think of it, I believe I had the dubious honor of posting the first
   199	message in the Raytrace Forum.  I'm pretty sure this is a good indication I
   200	spend *way* too much time on CIS.

   225	John & John -
   226	 
   227	The 3D glasses are indeed LCD shutters, sold by Sega to go with their video
   228	game system.  You can't find them in the stores anymore, but you can order
   229	them direct from Sega (800-872-7342) for $35 (+ about $2 S&H).  Delivery is
   230	quoted at 4-6 weeks, but I got mine in about 2.  VISA cheerfully accepted.
   231	 
   232	There was a schematic for driving the glasses posted on UseNet back in Jan of
   233	1990.  (I've been wanting to do this for a -long- time).  The design was for
   234	interfacing with the Mac serial port, but with some minor mods it seems to
   235	work just dandy off a PC parallel port.  If you have some CMOS in your junkbox,
   236	wirewrap tools in your toolbox, and know which end of a soldering iron to hold,
   237	you're all set.  I would have uploaded the schematic already, but I'll have to
   238	dig through the accompanying docs for copyright notices, etc.
   239	 
   240	The cord from the glasses terminates in a 1/8" stereo plug, which plugs into a
   241	little "interface block", which plugs into the game (I assume, I've never seen
   242	the game unit).  The schematic was for interfacing via the plug, and made no
   243	mention of this block thing.  To save a trip to Radio Shack I was going to
   244	scavenge the 1/8" jack off the block, but when I opened it up I found a little
   245	circuit board inside.  The numbers on the chips lead me to believe that this
   246	itself is the required interface, and the circuit I had just painstakingly
   247	assembled was redundant.  The block is just crying to be reverse engineered;
   248	anybody up for it?
   249	 
   250	For software, it's just a matter of doing "page flipping" and tickling bits
   251	on the parallel port.  Yes indeed, 3D FractInt creations, and raytraces,
   252	look -great- in color.

   300	Mike- Great! I didn't know about these, that's just what we need. You can't
   301	get them in stores anywhere? That's a shame. Are these color,do I understand
   302	correctly?    I have,in my hot little hands, C source code for a Mattel
   303	Powerglove interface, courtesy of Chris Babcock. I plan to upload it, once I'm
   304	sure about copyright and all (it's a little vague,  although Chris says it's
   305	OK, I'm guessing he has had contact. It also could use a couple of
   306	modifications, but Chris also tells me there is updated code on the way. I
   307	want ot compile and upload it as an executable,along with the source. The
   308	glove hardware interface uses RS-232. It looks like we have a good start! Once
   309	we get all the hardware info in the lib here, we can dive into getting it all
   310	integrated. Then we can work on some software for the thing.  Any ideas in
   311	particular about what we should actually DO with it,  once we get the hardware
   312	working?  Another thing about the hardware.  It looks as if maybe,to integrate
   313	the glove and glasses interfaces,  we might want to work on a design for a
   314	card to plug in an expansion slot with connections for the glove and glasses.
   315	We'll have to discuss that. I just got a copy of TurboCAD, so I can help lay
   316	out a board, rather than messing with wire-wrap (ARG!). Not that laying out a
   317	board is EASY, but for everyone else, it would be a little easier for everyone
   318	else if there was a way to get a board made from available artwork.

   339	Maybe you should declare an Application Extension block for your schematic

   355	I think I have the original schematic in a couple of different formats; GIF
   356	and PostScript for sure, maybe HPGL, and some stuff hidden in Mac .sit files
   357	that I can't get to.  As simple as the schematic is, it could probably be done
   358	in ascii with pluses, dashes, and vertical bars!  (Come to think of it, there
   359	is an alternate design using just an XOR and a 2N2222 transistor that was
   360	distributed just that way).

   394	As I just mentioned to Bill, I can now handle vector files, so myself,  if you
   395	could U.L. things in .DXF form, that would be cool.  The more I think about
   396	it, the more I like the idea of an expansion slot board with a glasses and
   397	glove interface. Of course, then we're talking about getting this stuff to
   398	talk directly to the buss,  instead of parallel port and serial port. In the
   399	case of the RS-232 interface used in the glove code I have from Chris, my
   400	problem is I only have COM1 and COM2,  I'd have to disconnect the mouse, or

   415	Bill- I think a .DXF version would be very nice. I don't know all the details
   416	of the process, but I do know that it's possible to get PCB artwork made from
   417	.DXF vector/AutoCAD files. Good luck getting boards made from GIFs!<g> Of
   418	course, I'm talking about board layouts,  whereas you guys are talking about
   419	the schematic, but I'm looking at both right now, I'd really like to be able
   420	to get a proper printed circuit made; I dread the idea of wire-wrapping a
   421	board! I work at an electronics manufacturer during the day, I'll have to talk
   422	to the guys who do board layout and see if I can get things plotted during
   423	"off" time. I just got a copy of TurboCad ($40,how could I pass it up!!??) so
   424	I can now handle such files. Timing is everything,eh? <g>

   437	They're just electronic sunglasses, where each lens can be made clear or opaque,
   438	quickly, in sync with an image on a crt.  Any color you see comes through the
   439	lenses from the monitor, not from the glasses themselves.

   441	I have been having some problems with the C source for the PowerGlove; my
   442	results are just not as good as what Chris is reporting.  My feeling has
   443	been that the low-level interface to the glove should be done with a simple
   444	cpu, as you suggest, to take some of the load off the pc.  With this thought
   445	in mind, I showed the glove to a friend who programs 8031's for living (simple,
   446	cheap, single chip computers).  He was impressed, and went out the next day
   447	and bought a glove for himself.  I next showed the thing to another buddy who
   448	does circuit board layouts for a living; he bought one too.  I just may turn
   449	my complete attention to the glasses and sit back and see what these two guys
   450	come up with.

   484	 
   485	I think I would hook mine up to a PC game port, since I have one on my system

   489

   511	for a living I design custom chips, we even have an 8031 cell in the library
   512	<g>. For around $20,000 I could do a custom chip that does EVERYTHING, the
   513	board would have one chip on it. While we're at it, how about a high

   528	I'm really interested in the $35 3D glasses - if anyone gets it running I want
   529	to hear. I assume to support it in fractint we would need a paged video mode.
   530	Those are in short supply at 256 colors, but the tweaked 320x400 mode is a

   580	One of the problems with going to an expansion slot card is that it would be
   581	useful only to those with IBM machines, whereas going with RS232 would open
   582	things up to all sorts of folks.  The headache of trying to decide which
   583	COM port to use could be helped by a cheap A-B switchbox.
   584	 
   585	Another concern I have is how to design a slot card that won't bump into other
   586	things, like com ports, parallel ports, video cards, lan cards, music boards,
   587	John's raytrace accelerator board <g>, etc.  It seems like it would take a lot
   588	of research to find safe, unused io ports or memory areas that wouldn't cause
   589	a conflict.  Maybe someone with some pc hardware savvy could dispel my fears
   590	on this.

   623	Keep in mind these aren't something you'd find in use at JPL; you get what you
   624	pay for.  Even when the lenses are clear they're as dark as sunglasses.  This
   625	may be by design, to cut contrast for reducing flicker.  I'm tempted to
   626	disect them to remove the LCDs and trash the dark plastic, but the plastic
   627	itself might be polarized and part of the whole scheme of things.  In the mean
   628	time I just keep the monitor's brightness pegged, and the room lights off.
   629	 
   630	Beyond that, they're not terribly comfortable, and look pretty ridiculous when
   631	worn by an adult (though not as strange as R/B glasses, or for that matter, a
   632	Power Glove).  But as you say, for $35, get two.  I'm thinking of getting a
   633	second pair...watching the screen flicker two images back and forth while
   634	someone else has the glasses on really does cause headaches.

   645	Speaking of Fractint, I've been using "Stereo: 3=photo" in the 3D Mode
   646	Selection menu and the images come out filling the screen from edge to edge.
   647	The Image Crop parameters on the Funny Glasses Parameters only seem to work
   648	for Red/Blue stereo types 1 & 2 (alternate & superimpose).  As expected the
   649	3D-ness goes completly out of whack around the edges.  Is there a way to force
   650	this cropping for type 3?  I guess a piclab script is the way to go for the
   651	time being, but I'm not sure just how much to crop and where.
   652	 
   653	I hope I've been using the term "page flipping" right.  By that do you mean
   654	getting both images loaded into the vga and fiddling the Start Address
   655	Register?  If so, yes, it seems to be fast enough, but getting it timed right
   656	with the LCDs seems to take a little fudging.  Right now I'm just using
   657	idiot-loop delays tuned from the keyboard, but some accurate msec delays and
   658	hooks into vertical retrace (or sync, or whatever) might improve things.

   687	All, Just noticed the new Virtual Reality forum here and it seems like a ghod
   688	send <G>. ive been involved heavily in graphics for the past 12 years doing
   689	everything from programming Video games for some of the Game company's around
   690	to recently in the past couple years getting heavily involved in Raytracing,
   691	rendering and compression. Im currently working on a new animation system etc.
   692	I was wondering what the main focus of this forum was going to be (I.E.
   693	discussion, design, etc). having only been exposed to Virtual Reality within
   694	the past 18 Months or so im still a little ignorant. Ive been toying with the
   695	idea of working on a design for a VR system etc and was wondering if anyone
   696	had already done preliminary work (Not the $50K plus systems <G>)?
   697	
   698	Anyhow hope this forum really takes off as working on Virtual Reality systems
   699	seems like a natural progression in not only the Game market, but for anything
   700	that requires almost true to life simulations etc.

   712	Tim,
   713	I just ordered the glasses, so we'll see what happens when I get them.
   714	(I suppose $35 is a little much for Mitch to include them in the book <g>).
   715	Maybe Larry could do the same sort of thing as the red/blue glasses, order a
   716	big bunch from Sega and make them available to members. (the capital outlay
   717	would be a bit more expensive though)
   718	 
   719	On a "standard" VGA you should be able to do page flipping in 320 x 200 and
   720	320 x 400 mode. For SVGA boards its quite easy, BUT each one does it
   721	differently. The code is going to need all that fun autodetect stuff to make
   722	it work. Hmmm on a 1 meg board you actually have 16 "pages" in 320 x 200
   723	mode, you could do a little animation in that.
   724	 
   725	I know, you can modify the "opening credits" screen so the names are rotating
   726	on a cylinder when seen through the glasses!

   763	Mike- Good points,all. I'm not a hardware designer, but I have enough
   764	electronics schooling to know that you're very right about designing a card
   765	that won't be fighting for addresses and interrupts. Big project,  no doubt.
   766	Plus the added disadvantage that people would have to make, or get made, a
   767	board, instead of just plugging in! As far as RS-232 vs.  IBM-compatible card
   768	goes, I'm thinking in terms of us developing software to go with it, for DOS.
   769	So the "exclusivity"  wouldn't bother me, as far as that is concerned. A
   770	switch box is a good idea, it would solve my problem at least (I mean, I
   771	wouldn't use the mouse AND P.G. at the same time,right?)    My concern is that
   772	if we end up with,say, a system that uses the power glove WITH glasses,  we'd
   773	be tying up plugs on the machine fast, and most of all, the speed problem. I
   774	suspect you hardware buddies would come up with a direct-buss interface
   775	because of speed. If that route is taken (and believe me, the trouble and $$
   776	of getting a board made would not be a treat) I suppose we'd need some sort of
   777	"install" software, to negotiate interrupts and addresses and stuff.  Play
   778	devil's advocate,  we need that.

   808	The 3D isn't for the image lab book (as I'm sure you realized :-)), but Mitch

   896	
   897	You may consider the use of the parallel port for information. Most systems
   898	have a spare one lying about, and I have used a TWO-WAY data transfer system
   899	that uses the supposedly unidirectional parallel port in my machine. Also,
   900	there's more data lines to play with, and greater flexibility, from my
   901	novice's point of view.

   946	example of what we're trying to achieve.
   947	
   948	An idea for the general pool - what of a VR project to interface CompuServe to
   949	user PCs, much like CIM and TapCIS do now, but in 3D, graphically? Using a

   988	section just opened this past weekend! So if you would like to get involved,
   989	you're certainly in at the ground floor. Sounds like you've got just the
   990	background we're looking for. We're just discussing some basics right now,
   991	feeling around for what hardware we can use, etc. I've written a short intro
   992	available in lib 13 as VRINTR.ZIP (or) VRINTR.DOC , just to give you a feel
   993	for what we want to do. In short, while there will almost certainly be
   994	discussion and philisophical ramblings, the main purpose is to try to bring VR
   995	to the average DOS-based PC.  Definitely NOT $50K-plus systems! e.g.,I have a
   996	12MHz 286 with 1MB of RAM. No Cray here!! Of course, my machine is pretty
   997	low-end, but we want to shoot for that sort of level.    Feel free to
   998	contribute any files you might have, and jump right in to the message threads.
   999	We already have messages on the board from several people who have been very
  1000	active on the graphics forums, including the Stone Soup Group, the bunch
  1001	responsible for FRACTINT. BTW,please go to the "change forum options"  menu
  1002	and add your last name, so we can keep things clear as the messages pile up.

  1013	John, Sounds Great, def lookig forward to things here. By the way i read a
  1014	thread about a PC-Board and i tend to agree that this may not be a good idea
  1015	as it ties it to a particualr machine etc. Has there been any thought when
  1016	developing the Viewing Helmet (whatever your calling it at the moment <G>) to
  1017	use something like a 32020 or or i860 for graphics rendering, these offer a
  1018	tremendous # of primatives (the I860 being a pure risc chip offers fantastic
  1019	speed) If something like this was integrated into the helmet i think you could
  1020	really get some great effects and speed. Anhow was just thinking off the top
  1021	of my head and it may be beyond an initial system etc. or it may be totally
  1022	the wrong direction <G>.

  1034	John, (& Mike),
  1035	       DONT rip the suckers apart! Thats exactly how an LCD display works. The
  1036	incoming light is polarized as it passes thru the active areas of the
  1037	"crystal". The active areas are either "on" or "off" (obviously <g>). The
  1038	crystal when "on" polarizes the light 90 deg away from the orientation of the
  1039	"film" polarizer stuck (with one *tough* adhesive!) to the outside of the
  1040	cell. Thus when "on" the light is blocked, "off" it is polarized on the way
  1041	out but still passed, albiet somewhat dimmer. I've ordered a pair too, should
  1042	have them soon!

  1080	Chris- OK, good to have another opinion about "to board or not to board".
  1081	About the system compatibility issue, I think an important consideration is
  1082	that we ought to steer activity toward DOS platform.  Mind you, I'm not going
  1083	to try to discourage general development, and there is room for several
  1084	different projects here.  But we should think in terms of software. The
  1085	general goal is to try to get VR working,  which implies more than just pieces
  1086	of hardware,  but some kind of application as well. Which brings us back to
  1087	platform. But we're pretty open . Perhaps, what we need is to develop a
  1088	consensus on a couple of pieces of hardware, and then any software projects
  1089	could take off from there using a common "standard". DOS machines are the most
  1090	common, and the work in the forum in general is pretty much DOS based, with
  1091	few exceptions.  But keep those ideas coming. The co-processor idea is
  1092	interesting, would you elaborate on any ideas? I saw something about TI
  1093	graphics processors in May DDJ,  what do you know about them? (TI340XX series)
  1094	There is, at this point, no formal "viewing helmet" underway,  although that
  1095	seems to me like a good project, one I'd like to see. If you have a proposal,
  1096	you can always upload it to the lib, since the message space is kind of small,
  1097	and also messages go away with age!  After a few weeks of kicking things
  1098	around, I'll look at what's on the table and offer my two cents about where we
  1099	seem to be going.

  1160	To bad on the "steer activity toward a DOS platform".  I've NEVER owned a DOS
  1161	machine, and probably never will.  What about the Amiga/Mac/Atari/OSK/UNIX
  1162	types?  There are plenty of those running POVRay.  You mentioned Chris Babcock
  1163	a few days ago, you know he wrote the Flood fill routine for my OSK box? Be
  1164	careful when you claim that "the work in the Forum in general is pretty much
  1165	DOS based, with few exceptions."   I guess you have not been reading all the
  1166	forum messages.  I think the forum is pretty much for 'portability' these
  1167	days.  Or maybe because I'm for it, my bias just makes those messages stand
  1168	out.  I agree Fractint is buried in DOS.  But POV and DKB and AEWire (A wire
  1169	fram modeller), are not.
  1170	
  1171	Anyway, I'd like to be involved with the Powerglove/Glasses stuff too, but If
  1172	I need a DOS machine to do it, I'll have to pass.  I do understand that when
  1173	talking GFX, you have to have some machine specific code,  but look at the
  1174	potential amount of hackers 'steering towards DOS' will leave out or the VR
  1175	projects.  I just don't like to have the nature of the machine interface rule
  1176	out any but IBMPC owners.

  1190	I think one of the best uses of this (particularlyy in the short term) will
  1191	be the interface for the wireframe modeler being worked on over in POV land.
  1192	I think you have to be careful that VR be used for something that it is GOOD
  1193	at, not just as a new fangled interface for something that already works
  1194	well. For example I personally would NOT go to the trouble to put on gloves
  1195	and glasses to run TAPCIS (it works fine just the way it is). But it would be
  1196	the "only game in town" for things like the 3d modeler, specifying the path
  1197	for a "flyby" of a julibrot etc.
  1198	 
  1199	It would also have a great use in scientific analysis software. Displaying
  1200	and analyzing graphs of many variables is traditionally a very tough job,
  1201	with VR you could do a true 3D graph, and the user can go right inside the
  1202	graph and move around in the "graph" space. (business types could also use
  1203	this alot. I can just see the multi-megabuck version of the hardware being
  1204	used at the "anual meeting" to show the financial graphs to the stockholders)
  1205	 
  1206	This is where I think the initial energies should be focused, on things that
  1207	cannot be done very well by any of the more "traditional" methods.

  1209	Focusing on applications such as the TAPCIS interface is just going to get
  1210	us labeled as a bunch of crazy fools rather than making significant
  1211	improvements in the computing environment.

  1224	Oops,
  1225	I replied to John rather than to you about the TAPCIS connection. See that
  1226	message for my thoughts on the subject.
  1227	 
  1228	I just had another thought on this, looking and working with a thread graph
  1229	might be an amuzing application of VR technology.
  1230	 
  1231	BTW in order to REALLY make this work right we are going to need some way of
  1232	sensing the users head in relationship to the screen, so the software can do
  1233	the "looking around an object" bit. Ultrasonic transducers at the corners of
  1234	the screen and a little microphone on the glasses would probably work quite
  1235	well. I did a system like this awhile back, on a much larger scale, tracking
  1236	the position of a person in a room. Given the slow speed of sound, the
  1237	hardware is quite simple. Send out a pulse and start a counter, when the pulse
  1238	comes back in from the mic, stop the counter. Of course you have to worry
  1239	about ambient noise, but that is actually fairly easy to handle with digital
  1240	phase locked loop apprroaches.

  1271	John, I agree a lot of development is done on DOS but other machines do lend
  1272	themselves nicely to graphics developement and def cannot be ignored even in
  1273	the first go round (I Mean even if they arent developed for at the start they
  1274	def have to be kept in mind when designing and there strengths and weaknesses
  1275	addressed as well). As to the TI 320xx chip, about 2 yrs ago i was working on
  1276	an imaging system and the TI chips were ones we explored for using in a
  1277	display bored for our system. The chip is really nice in that it offers
  1278	(32020) about 12-15 mips graphics performance and includes a large set up
  1279	built in primatives for drawing, scaling, rotatiting, off screen drawing, and
  1280	just about any other graphic primative you might need. My suggestion into
  1281	integrating a chip like this into the helmet was not only to give a leg up on
  1282	primatives for rendering, and drawing but back to the main issue keeping the
  1283	VR work somewhat system independent. If the helmet was linked via the
  1284	Parrallel or Serial port and update packets (fromt he host) were sent to the
  1285	helmet (Which would need to have other chips to run the 320xx and receive data
  1286	etc) it could render seens pretty much instantly removing the drawing job from
  1287	the host thus freeing it do go onto the next task it had to perform etc. And
  1288	software that used a sort of update packet driven scheme could easily be
  1289	written machine independent. But like i said something like this is  prob in
  1290	the future or way off base, but thought id throw it into the fray <G>. But you
  1291	may be right in that initial software (primatives, Libs, and controllers)
  1292	should be written for prototyping etc. Has there ever been any thought to
  1293	creating your own glove using motion sensors etc? Also went looking for the
  1294	powerglove and couldnt find it, did they stop selling it? Also what kind of
  1295	cost does it incur to purcahse this thing <G>.
  1296	
  1297	Anyhow had thought about a helmet before so thought id ask <G>.

  1320	I'd have to throw in my vote towards multi-platform design on your projects. 
  1321	I myself am totally DOS based, but I know from my experience with the PoV
  1322	group that portability is a great asset.  You will find plenty of help and
  1323	advice on portability issues over in the Raytracing forum.  David Buck has
  1324	even written a document outlining the major considerations for portabile
  1325	graphics programming.  By keeping the platform generic, help will come from
  1326	experience programmers from all of those platforms and the variety of
  1327	viewpoints will only enhance the program.
  1328	
  1329	I'm excited to see what develops here!

  1381	 
  1382	Ever since I was a child I have taken the expression "Don't!" as a call to
  1383	action, especially when it involved taking things apart. Thanks, I needed that.
  1384	 
  1385	The glasses can indeed be taken apart with nothing more than a pocket knife.
  1386	The 2 LCDs are mounted on a frame stuck in a sunglasses "shell", and can be
  1387	eaily, carefully, pried out without damage. (There is a contact point on
  1388	either side, 3 across the top, 2 on the bottom; you'll see what I mean when
  1389	yours are delivered).  The polarizers are part of the LCDs themselves, not
  1390	the sunglass plastic.
  1391	 
  1392	Without the sunglasses, the lenses pass a *lot* of light.  I don't know the
  1393	proper terminology to use here, but I want to say it seems like there is now
  1394	5% attenuation instead of 35.  Color images come through wonderfully without
  1395	having to max out the brightness control, and you can work much better with
  1396	room lights on.  The downside is that flicker is very noticible.  Right now I
  1397	can put up with it to see raytraces in full color 3D (640x480x256x3? :-), but
  1398	I think when the novelty wears off, the flicker will become quite annoying.
  1399	 
  1400	Maybe "flip up" shades and little epoxy will do the trick.

  1461	keep thinking about it! As I said last msg., there has been no specific
  1462	proposal for a helmet, we're discussing things in general now,  but that is
  1463	worth working on, for sure. Not off base at all. The only consideration from
  1464	my view is that it not be too expensive. Write something up and upload it to
  1465	the library. Use lib 2,"new images", and Matt Drury will copy it over to
  1466	section 13. On the helmet again, this is the sort of thing I imagined when

  1489	Mike- I won't argue. Personally, I can see many reasons for keeping it broad
  1490	as far as platform goes, I mean, you could make a good case that the Amiga is
  1491	the way to go here! I have DKB,for example, which was originally developed FOR
  1492	the Amiga, and then ported to DOS by Aaron Collins. So I understand, your
  1493	point is well taken, believe me. I won't sit here trying to tell everyone that
  1494	DOS is it, like it or leave it.  That would be, quite simply, nothing short of
  1495	foolish. I do think,  however, that it IS important to remember that DOS is
  1496	the closest thing there is to a "defacto" OS there is. That's nothing against
  1497	other platforms, I would like to have an Amiga and a Mac in addition to my
  1498	286.  Also, please read my opening messages to the section, you will notice I
  1499	proposed using C for projects. One of the reasons, I don't think it's
  1500	necessary to point out, is portability of code (up to a point, at least).
  1501	Relax. No one is going to get left out here. Besides,  the more I think about
  1502	it, and the more I read in the messages from people who are miles beyond me
  1503	technically, I think a card is probably unnecessary after all. Using serial
  1504	and parallel ports will probably do.  When things DO get platform-specific,
  1505	can I take your message as an offer to help make developing code work on
  1506	different platforms? There is no reason why we can't have parallel projects
  1507	going on, anyway; but a little bit of unified effort is important, so we can
  1508	get the most from our collected resources.  Nothing is fixed yet, so hang in
  1509	there, and most important, keep telling me what you think.

  1546	Last year I asked a friend who is an engineer at a British aerospace company
  1547	about the availability of laser gyros. He smiled and said, yep, they are
  1548	available, weigh only 20 pounds and cost a mere $100K.
  1549	
  1550	A few weeks ago, there was a tiny notice on Business Week's "New Technology"
  1551	page about an upstart company that makes a cheap ($500) and tiny (2 oz.)
  1552	gyroscope. Given the size and weight, it MUST be a laser gyro. As a first
  1553	application, they are doing a 3D mouse. The company's name is Gyration Inc. 
  1554	No address was given.
  1555	
  1556	If this thing works with reasonable speed and precision, it is exactly the
  1557	kind of position sensor VR needs ! Other than the currently used magnetic and
  1558	ultrasound sensors, a gyro would not need a transmitter reference point that
  1559	has a data link to the receiver, and there is NO RANGE LIMITATION.  It could
  1560	even be used for a mobile/outdoors VR system.

  1610	VR needs VERY fast 3D rendering, and a "naked" PC/Amiga/Atari/Mac simply does
  1611	not have the MIPs that it takes.
  1612	
  1613	To get a discussion going, I'll list some possible PC-based rendering engines:
  1614	
  1615	1) Intel DVI card Used by Sense8 for the WorldToolKit. The 750 processor seems
  1616	to be pretty good at texture mapping, but has no FPU. Still no Gouraud shading
  1617	and low polygon count, but the polygons can be phototextured.  Stuff like a
  1618	triangle with a "fir tree" texture or a square with an "oriental rug" pattern
  1619	makes a virtual world look pretty good.  DVI cards are readily available and
  1620	do double duty as multimedia hardware in Multimedia Windows. They also have a
  1621	very good audio section.
  1622	
  1623	2) Transputer (net) + frame buffer My personal favourite. Transputers are not
  1624	very popular in the US (not-invented-here syndrome?), but the new T9000 chips
  1625	are the ONLY way to do fancy stuff like realtime raytracing. A single T9000
  1626	has about 100 MIPs, and an arbitrary number of T9000s can be connected in
  1627	multiprocessing transputer nets by four 100mbps packet-switching data links
  1628	integrated on the chip.Extremely high performance + unlimited scaleabilty !
  1629	Transputer boards are also easy to layout (few glue chips).
  1630	
  1631	3) 80860 + frame buffer Very fast FPU with special 3D-oriented instructions
  1632	that facilitate shading and Z-buffering.
  1633	
  1634	4) Graphics processors Division has an 80860 board that offloads shading to a
  1635	High Speed Shading Processor (AFAIK, made by Sharp). It is said to shade twice
  1636	as fast as the 80860. Maybe a HSSP-only board is worth a try.
  1637	
  1638	5) ASICs What about a few nifty FPGAs ? Dream on...

  1671	
  1672	On helping with code,Yessir!  I'll be more than willing to help do code for
  1673	the platform I have.  Which at the moment is a Signetics 68070 box with a

  1690	Mike,
  1691	(in accordance with John's message this is now a new thread)
  1692	Thats great that it can actually be made to transmit a lot more light, I'll
  1693	have to wait to get mine before I can talk intelligently about them though.
  1694	 
  1695	I was thinking about tweaking the VGA timing such that you used as fast a
  1696	vertical refresh rate as your board and monitor can take. For 640 x 480 and
  1697	lower on the Ergo that means 90Hz (which is the fastest most monitors can
  1698	do). That should have considerably less flicker than what you get out of
  1699	"normal" modes. Another approach would be to use a builtin interlaced mode,
  1700	and alternate the lines from the two images in the video ram, you wouldn't
  1701	have to do ANYTHING to the VGA then, just make sure that the glasses are
  1702	syncronized with the vertical rate. It wouldn't cut down on the flicker, but
  1703	the software would not need to tweak the VGA.
  1704	 
  1705	 
  1706	I was talking to friend at work about this and he came up with a nice
  1707	solution which might work. Switch the glasses in two or three places during
  1708	the drawing of the scan, and interleave the eyes on one image, then have the
  1709	other image use the oposite eye interleaving. The only problem with this is
  1710	that the glasses might not change fast enough to "swap" on the fly (it would
  1711	have to be done during the HORIZONTAL retrace, which isn't all that long
  1712	<g>.)

  1723	Actually it probably is NOT a laser gyro. All a lazer gyro is, is an almost
  1724	indestructable accelerometer. There are many other forms of accelerometers
  1725	which are MUCH cheaper than a laser one (and offer better resolution for
  1726	small size). I worked on one many years ago (so its probably much better and
  1727	cheaper today) which consisted of one of those integrated circuit pressure
  1728	sensors, with a tiny blob of mercury on the sensor surface (kept in place
  1729	with a little plastic buble). As the whole assembly moved the mercury would
  1730	push against the sensor, giving a nice proportional voltage to acceleration.
  1731	We used several of these in a little array to form a gyroscope, and put it in
  1732	a car and you could basically track it around town. After running around town
  1733	all day the absolute position error was about about 5 feet. The position
  1734	accuracy was primarily determined by how good the ADCs were. To get that good
  1735	in those days needed some awfully expensive ADCs. (the wole thing took up
  1736	about a cubic inch PLUS electronics of course <g>). I'm not sure if it was
  1737	sensitive enough for use on a glove though. The entire sensor array cost
  1738	about $60, but then there were the ADCs and other electronics, including a
  1739	computer, so the TOTAL cost was pretty high. It could be done a LOT cheaper
  1740	today. The sensors are a little cheaper, but the rest is much less.

  1751	Alexander,
  1752	I work for an ASIC company and have worked on a number of very high
  1753	performance proprietary graphics chips. The last one I worked on could do
  1754	150,000 tranformed, shaded 3d polygons per second, not too shabby
  1755	performance!
  1756	 
  1757	The last time I looked at a transputer design (several years ago) the
  1758	interchip communcations was so slow it killed the system (that was a DSP
  1759	application), we wound up doing it with an ASIC instead. It sounds like they
  1760	have improved a LOT since then. (I'm not sure I trust the 100 Mips number
  1761	though, there is so much specmanship going on its incredible, I also design
  1762	RISC processors so I'm constantly battling with marketing over ours and the
  1763	competition's "mips rating"). I think you just got my juices flowing again to
  1764	look into transputers.
  1765	 
  1766	Unfortunately for use by us on this forum, those graphics processor chips
  1767	have an NRE of $250,000 and unit costs of $300 or so (in volume).

  1778	Alexander, Your thought about not being able to get the throughput etc on a
  1779	plain machine without some co-processor help mimic mine exactly. Haveing done
  1780	so many video games and other graphic demos for some pretty sophisticatd
  1781	stuff, it just dont have it alone. I myself dont think i'd go with DVi
  1782	although nice. Your transputer idea is very interesting as they rent that
  1783	expensive and do offer incredible processing power. I had talked with John
  1784	about some of this and was discussing it last night, there def has to be some
  1785	sort of viewing device, beyond 3D-glasses, so i had proposed placing the
  1786	rendering system in the helmet and have the host send updates to it etc. The
  1787	helmet should be able to be programmed to render based on a set of information
  1788	etc. Initialy placing it in the helmet may not be cost-effective etc, so we
  1789	had thought about a co-processor board in the machine with the helmet system
  1790	connected. I have not had the pleasure of using Transputers yet, but have done
  1791	something similiar to this with TI chips althought they are much slower.
  1792	
  1793	Anyway, think your suggestions are pretty much right on.

  1803	Guess what!  Logitech will be marketing a combination 3-button-2D, 5-button-3D
  1804	mouse (with a little ultrasonic tripod) "2nd quarter '92" and are offering a
  1805	programmer's interface and prototype mouse right now "in limited quantities." 
  1806	I've got a press release from them that you can find in the LOGITECH forum,
  1807	library 6, Announcements, file 3D.TXT.  The description mentions a "head
  1808	tracker mount" which seems to be included, and a "dual mode" allowing two mice
  1809	(one head-mounted, one hand-held) to be used simultaneously (it then goes on
  1810	to say that _four_ mice can be used simultaneously with one tripod--share your
  1811	VR with a friend!).  Interesting features will include audio in-out and a
  1812	suspend button that freezes mouse output so that it can be repositioned
  1813	(equivalent to lifting a 2d mouse off of the pad to reposition it).  It will
  1814	have both Mac and PC (and whatever) interfaces and only requires a serial port
  1815	interface.
  1816	
  1817	No word on pricing, of course, but I will be calling Logitech later this
  1818	morning to find out what the development kit is going for.  Hopefully, I can
  1819	leave a message with their response this evening.  If it's not too expensive
  1820	this might be an alternative to a homebrew powerglove/head position interface.
  1821	If Logitech makes enough noise (and they don't seem to be slouches in the
  1822	marketing area) we might see a lot of third-party support for this (heck, even
  1823	Microsoft included a LogiMouse driver in Win3 from day one).

  1884	What about doing the software in C++ instead of C ?
  1885	
  1886	The C++ 2.0 language definition is stable now, Borland C++ looks OK and
  1887	Microsoft C/C++ 7.0 will - hopefully - turn up sometime next year.
  1888	Macs/Ataris/Amigas should have comparable compilers by now.
  1889	
  1890	There's nothing more object-oriented than constructing a virtual world !
  1891	
  1892	It would also do the C people (including myself) good to do some object
  1893	oriented programming, because that's where a programmer's money will come from
  1894	in the next ten years. Learning experience ! Once you know how to handle it,
  1895	C++ is just more efficient and productive than C.
  1896	
  1897	OTOH, C++ certainly has some acceptance problems, not everybody wants to cough
  1898	up the money for a new compiler, and C++ might just slow down the real work
  1899	here.
  1900	
  1901	Another idea: Some kind of object-oriented database module is necessary for
  1902	keeping track of all the virtual thingies, their possible behaviour (methods)
  1903	and interactions. That's a tricky one. Are there some DB gurus around ?
  1904	
  1905	One of the most fascinating and daunting characteristics of VR software is
  1906	it's potentially limitless hierarchy of objects, rules and relationships.
  1907	Maybe we should open PHILOSOPHY and FLAME threads, eh?

  1929	Matt, the "Virtuality" gear is on display in the Trocadero amusement center at
  1930	Piccadilly Circus, London. If anybody happens to be in London, this is
  1931	certainly worth a visit. There are four linked "sitdown" vehiclesimulation
  1932	type units.  In the current game you control a robot biped and shoot at, or
  1933	bump into, robots controlled by other players. Neat stuff! The hardware looks
  1934	very slick and professional. The helmets are quite heavy, but that's okay for
  1935	a 5 minute arcade game.
  1936	
  1937	I've heard there are two linked "standup" units in Covent Garden amusement
  1938	center that are in plexiglass cages on opposite ends of a restaurant. The
  1939	eaters have a laugh seeing the players doing strange contortions and groping
  1940	around in thin air.
  1941	
  1942	The company's phone number is 0533 542 127, and the president is one
  1943	Dr.Walden. They first displayed "Virtuality" at last year's Computer Graphics
