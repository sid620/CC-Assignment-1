     1	                    ASP Membership Requirements
     2	
     3	The following are the general standards that ALL ASP authors (full members)
     4	have agreed to follow.  Each was passed by at least a 2/3 vote of those
     5	members voting and is binding on all authors.  They consist of a support
     6	policy, a policy on payments, a policy on no crippled software, an
     7	Ombudsman policy and some miscellaneous items:
     8	
     9	
    10	               **** ASP SOFTWARE SUPPORT POLICY ****
    11	
    12	1. All ASP members' shareware products must provide support (included in the
    13	purchase price) for a minimum of three months from the date of registration.
    14	If the support is by telephone, there may be a limitation on BOTH the total
    15	connect time and the period after purchase during which it is available
    16	without additional cost so long as the connect time is at least 30 minutes
    17	during the required three months.  Support may be provided for a fee after
    18	this initial period has elapsed. The support policy must be clearly stated in
    19	the shareware documentation.
    20	
    21	2.  Support during the initial period may be one or more of the following:
    22	
    23	    - mail support
    24	
    25	    - telephone support (if this is the only support provided, at a
    26	      minimum an answering machine must be available 4 hours per day; this
    27	      support may be limited to thirty minutes of connect time at the
    28	      option of the author)
    29	
    30	     - for communications products, or ones associated to a communication
    31	       product by BBS or major communications service
    32	
    33	     - by any alternate method approved by the Board of Directors by a two
    34	       thirds vote (of those directors voting)
    35	
    36	3.  The minimum level of support required by this policy involves answering
    37	questions and fixing serious bugs during the minimum three month period.  For
    38	problems involving a specific hardware or software environment or feature, the
    39	author may choose not to modify the program.  In that case, if the report is
    40	within three months after purchase, then the author shall offer to refund the
    41	user's purchase price.
    42	
    43	4. Any money sent to an author to register an unsupported product shall be
    44	promptly returned with an explanation that the product in question is no
    45	longer supported.
    46	
    47	5.   Known incompatibilities with other software or hardware and major or
    48	unusual program limitations are noted in the documentation that comes with
    49	the shareware (evaluation) program.
    50	
    51	
    52	
    53	            **** ASP REGISTRATION PAYMENT POLICY *****
    54	
    55	1. The Documentation must clearly describe how to register the product and
    56	what goods and/or services the user will receive for registering.
    57	
    58	2. Fees must be expressed in fixed monetary amounts.  Voluntary payments or
    59	contributions may not be solicited, although phrasing such as "if you use
    60	and like this product, please register" is allowed.
    61	
    62	3. Multiple levels of registration may be set, as long as each level
    63	individually satisfies the above two requirements.
    64	
    65	
    66	               **** ASP POLICY ON NO CRIPPLING ****
    67	
    68	The principle behind shareware is "try before you buy."  ASP believes that
    69	users have a right to try a fully functioning shareware program in their
    70	regular computing environment. Accordingly, ASP authors agree that:
    71	
    72	   (1) The executable files (and/or items linked in with executables)
    73	   in their shareware and registered versions will be the same (with
    74	   the exceptions noted below)
    75	
    76	   (2) All the program's features will be fully documented.
    77	
    78	   (3) Registration encouragement procedures which in the judgment of
    79	   the Board are either unreasonable or unprofessional are not allowed.
    80	
    81	       Registration Reminder Screens should (if used):
    82	
    83	          1) be displayed no more than twice each time the program
    84	             runs (or twice per day for long-running programs such as
    85	             TSR's).
    86	
    87	          2) not require more than two keystrokes to bypass.
    88	
    89	          3) not have a forced minimum display time of more than three
    90	             seconds.  In other words, the RRS itself should not take
    91	             control of the computer away from the user for more than
    92	             three seconds.
    93	
    94	          Practices such as creating undocumented hidden files or printing
    95	          a registration form without the user's knowledge or consent are
    96	          prohibited.  It is NOT necessary to have any of the above as a
    97	          simple "Strike Any Key To Continue" is the least objectional to
    98	          the user.
    99	
   100	    (4)  Solicitation of sales of a non-shareware version (NSV) of a
   101	          shareware program may be made in the evaluation version only if it
   102	          meets the following guidelines:
   103	
   104	          (a) Features of the NSV not in the shareware version must not be
   105	              detailed in the body of the documentation. An appendix or
   106	              separate file listing the features may be used.
   107	
   108	          (b) The shareware version may not present any features of the NSV
   109	              during its operation such as in stubbed-out menus or in on-line
   110	              help. A solicitation of the NSV and its features may be
   111	              presented in any Registration Reminder Screens and on order
   112	              forms.
   113	
   114	          (c) The names of the NSV and the shareware program must be
   115	              distinctly different. Suffixes such as 'Plus', 'Pro',
   116	              'Gold', 'LAN', etc. meet this distinction. Numeric version
   117	              or suffix numbers do not meet this distinction.
   118	
   119	          (d) The shareware version may not be designed or implemented in
   120	              such a fashion that, in the opinion of 60% of the Board of
   121	              Directors, it gives the user the impression that the
   122	              shareware version's major purpose is to sell copies of the NSV.
   123	
   124	
   125	Exceptions to a strict interpretation of this policy are as follows:
   126	
   127	   - to save disk space, tutorial and additional explanatory
   128	     material may be left out of the shareware documentation.
   129	
   130	   - the shareware version may have registration encouragement
   131	     procedures absent from the registered version (or which can be
   132	     disabled with a code only provided to registered users).
   133	
   134	   - the registered version may include sample files not included
   135	     in the shareware version.
   136	
   137	   - if source code is offered with the registered version,
   138	     it may be withheld from the shareware version.
   139	
   140	   - the author may provide two shareware versions: one a small
   141	     version which the author designates the distributed version
   142	     in normal circumstances (e.g. language tools in C only
   143	     available in one model) so long as the full shareware version
   144	     is available from some public source (possibly for a small
   145	     distribution fee) and may be copied for trial purposes.
   146	     The small version's documentation must clearly describe
   147	     how users may obtain the full shareware version.
   148	
   149	   - registered users may be provided bonus utilities unrelated to
   150	     (and which do not change) the basic functionality of the program
   151	
   152	   - registered users may be given utilities which provide a
   153	     convenience but which are not essential
   154	
   155	   - exceptions approved by the ASP board of directors
   156	     by a 60% vote of those voting
   157	
   158	   - It is an acceptable registration incentive to market the first
   159	     product of a series as shareware and use the remaining products as
   160	     registration incentives, so long as the remaining products are
   161	     merely "more of the same" when compared to the first product. The
   162	     author may charge a single registration fee for the set, or may use
   163	     varying levels of registration to allow customers to obtain the
   164	     original product and/or remaining products.
   165	
   166	
   167	                  **** ASP OMBUDSMAN POLICY ****
   168	
   169	1.  The board shall set up the office of Ombudsman and appoint someone to
   170	    that position.  The Ombudsman's sole role shall be to mediate disputes
   171	    between ASP members and their customers.  The Ombudsman shall report
   172	    to the board situations where he feels board action or knowledge is
   173	    appropriate.
   174	
   175	2.  All ASP members and vendor associate members are required to cooperate
   176	    with the Ombudsman when approached by him/her.
   177	
   178	3.  The Shareware version of any shareware program produced by ASP author
   179	    members must contain the following text as part of some file on the
   180	    disk.  (The shareware version means the one intended for trial use).
   181	
   182	    "This program is produced by a member of the Association of Shareware
   183	    Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure that the shareware
   184	    principle works for you. If you are unable to resolve a
   185	    shareware-related problem with an ASP member by contacting the member
   186	    directly, ASP may be able to help. The ASP Ombudsman can help you
   187	    resolve a dispute or problem with an ASP member, but does not provide
   188	    technical support for members' products.  Please write to the ASP
   189	    Ombudsman at 545 Grover Road, Muskegon, MI USA 49442-9427, Fax
   190	    616-788-2765, or send a CompuServe message via CompuServe Mail to ASP
   191	    Ombudsman 70007,3536."
   192	
   193	4.  Inclusion of Ombudsman statement.
   194	
   195	    a.  The Ombudsman statement shall be included in the shareware version
   196	         in a location clearly accessible to the evaluator.
   197	
   198	     b.  Any registered versions which contain reference to the ASP or use
   199	         the ASP logo must contain the Ombudsman statement but they may be
   200	         in a written form rather than on disk.
   201	
   202	     c.  If the ASP logo or name is used by any ASP approved vendor in any
   203	         ads/catalogs etc , then that vendor must include the OMB
   204	         statement with their catalogs and newsletters and is encouraged
   205	         to include it with any disks sold containing ASP member programs.
   206	
   207	     d.  Members are free to include the Ombudsman statement in printed
   208	         documentation, ads and other mailings if they wish.
   209	
   210	5.  The first sentence may be replaced by "<Member's name> is a member of
   211	    the Association of Shareware Professionals (ASP)."  If a member's
   212	    company qualifies under the company name policy, the company name may
   213	    be used instead of <member's name>.
   214	
   215	6.  ASP approved vendors must include the following statement with their
   216	    catalogs and newsletters and are encouraged to include it with all
   217	    disks sold:

   219	    "Company X is an Approved Vendor and a member of the Association
   220	    of Shareware Professionals (ASP). ASP wants to make sure that the
   221	    shareware principle works for you. If you are unable to resolve
   222	    a shareware-related problem with an ASP member by contacting the
   223	    member directly, ASP may be able to help. The ASP Ombudsman can
   224	    help you resolve a dispute or problem with an ASP member, but does not
   225	    provide technical support for members' products. Please write to the
   226	    ASP Ombudsman at 545 Grover Road, Muskegon, MI USA 49442-9427, Fax
   227	    616-788-2765, or send a CompuServe message via CompuServe Mail to ASP
   228	    Ombudsman 70007,3536."
   229	
   230	7.  The Ombudsman statement may not be hidden in a file or other manner
   231	    which 60% of the board of directors regards as obscure.
   232	
   233	8.  ASP approved BBS Systems must include the following statement as a
   234	    system bulletin (or as a downloadable file, if and only if an online
   235	    bulletin is not feasible), Which is to be accessible by all callers:

   237	    "<Name of BBS> is an Approved BBS and a member of the Association
   238	    of Shareware Professionals (ASP). ASP wants to make sure that
   239	    the shareware principle works for you. If you are unable to resolve

   246	    Ombudsman 70007,3536."
   247	
   248	9.  If posted as a bulletin, the title of said bulletin shall be "ASP
   249	    Ombudsman Statement"; if posted as a downloadable file, the filename
