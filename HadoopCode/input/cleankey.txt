    10	   In  the process of owning and operating an IBM PC,  you will,  no  doubt, 
    11	find  a point in time that the keyboard causes strange and irritating things 
    12	to  happen  to your fond finger strokes.   Nine times out of  ten,  this  is 
    13	caused by DIRT!  
    14	It is amazing how much trash can be found under the keytops of any keyboard
    15	that has been in use for more than a few weeks.   Human hands carry a  great 
    16	deal  of  trash,  including dead skin cells.   In addition,  leaning over  a 
    17	keyboard,  as computer people are prone to do, can cause much "head garbage" 
    18	to fall into the mechanism.   If you smoke (as I do), you'll find it next to 
    19	impossible to keep ashes in the ashtray.
    20	   The symptoms of a keyboard dirt problem are manifold, but the most common
    21	are:  mistyped characters, missing letters (Did I miss the key?), and having 
    22	the wrong character appear at the most obnoxious times.
    23	   The fix to most of these problems is to clean the bugger out.  To do this
    24	you  must  remove  the keytops and blow out the  mechanism  with  air.   The 
    25	purpose  of this message is to explain the operation of the PC keyboard  and 
    26	to  outline the steps necessary to clean it.   I've included some  notes  on 
    27	some possible pitfalls that a few folks have run into.
    28	   The PC keyboard is a capacitive device,  that is,  its internal circuitry 
    29	detects  each  keystroke by a change in the capacitive potential of  a  wire 
    30	matrix the keys are mounted on.   This matrix is contained in the form of  a 
    31	circuit  board  that contains small "plates" that connect to a  device  that 
    32	monitors  capacitive levels.   Above each of these plates is a "toggle" made 
    33	of conductive plastic (like they ship IC's in).   The toggles are  connected 
    34	to  a small spring that is held straight and slightly compressed in a  small 
    35	cylinder.   The  thing  that  hold the spring compress is  a  small  plunger 
    36	attached to the bottom of each key.  When the toggle moves in its holder, it 
    37	changes  the capacitive potential of the wire matrix and causes the keyboard 
    38	logic circuits to send a scan code to the 8088 bus.
    39	   When you press a key, the plunger moves down in the cylinder, compressing
    40	the spring.  This spring is already holding the toggle away from the matrix. 
    41	As  the pressure increases,  the spring becomes "unstable" and bends rapidly 
    42	to form a loose "U" shape.   This action is felt (and heard) as the  "break" 
    43	of  the  key.   When the key breaks,  the direction of the pressure  on  the 
    44	toggle  is  reversed,  causing  it to swing down about 1.5mm closer  to  the 
    45	matrix.   This  is detected by the keyboard logic circuitry as a  change  in 
    46	capacitive  potential and the appropriate scan code is sent to the 8088 bus, 
    47	to be processed.
    48	   When  you  lift your finger from the key,  the spring pops  back  to  its 
    49	straight position and lifts the toggle away from the matrix.
    50	   As  you can see,  there is alot of mechanical interaction going on inside 
    51	of the lowly keyboard.   What amazes me is that the devices are as  reliable 
    52	as they are!
    53	   To clean the keyboard, turn off the PC and place the keyboard in you lap.
    54	Remove  each  key  by  prying  it  STRAIGHT UP  with  a  penknife  of  small 
    55	screwdriver  until  it pops off.   Check each key for any  gummy  or  sticky 
    56	matter,  placing the dirty keys in a pile to be cleaned with soap and water.  
    57	DO  NOT  REMOVE  THE  SPACE BAR!!!   If you do,  youll  find  it  is  almost 
    58	impossible  to  replace  properly.   After removing the keys,  take  a  low-
    59	pressure air hose (or hair dryer) and blow a stream of air down into the key 
    60	tubes.
    61	
    62	The  air  will  remove  quite a bit of loose dirt from  the  inside  of  the 
    63	keyboard.  This dirt,  if left in place, will alter the capacitive potential 
    64	of the matrix, thus "fooling" the keyboard circuitry into thinking a key has 
    65	been pressed when it has not.   A WORD OF WARNING:  Do NOT-NOT-NOT blow into 
    66	the key tubes with your mouth!!!  You will blow moisture into the mechanism, 
    67	and possibly ruin the keyboard unit ($125.00 spare part).  Nine times out of 
    68	ten,  all that is necessary to correct keyboard errors is to clean the keys, 
    69	and the rest of this is not required.
    70	   If  you  did not heed my warning about the mouth air,  you will  have  to 
    71	remove  the matrix board from the key tube holder and clean it.   THIS IS  A 
    72	VERY DELICATE OPERATION!   DO NOT-NOT-NOT ATTEMPT IT UNLESS YOU NEED TO!  To 
    73	remove  the key matrix,  turn the keyboard over and remove the two screws on 
    74	the  bottom.  Remove the bottom panel from the keyboard and  disconnect  the 
    75	Berg connector that holds the keyboard cable to the circuit board inside the 
    76	unit.   Place  the keyboard in your lap and remove ALL the keys.   Carefully 
    77	turn the unit upside-down,  taking care not to bend the springs.   With  the 
    78	keyboard upside-down,  and the PC (printed circuit) board on the right side, 
    79	you  will  see several metal "clips" holding the silver matrix board to  the 
    80	black key tube holder.   One of these clips (probably on the lower left)  is 
    81	bent  over  the silver matrix holder.  Bend this clip away from  the  silver 
    82	metal.   Hold  the  two  parts together FIRMLY and slide the  silver  matrix 
    83	holder to the right (on mine,  at least).   THIS TAKES ALOT OF PRESSURE!  BE 
    84	SURE YOU DON'T ALLOW THE TWO PARTS TO SEPARATE SUDDENLY,  OR YOUR FLOOR WILL 
    85	BE LITTERED WITH TOGGLES.   Carefully remove the matrix holder from the tube 
    86	holder and place the tube holder in a safe place. Use a clean, slightly damp 
    87	rag  to  clean the surface of the matrix board.   DO NOT ALLOW WATER TO  GET 
    88	UNDER  THE BOARD!   Allow the unit to dry.   You may perform an  interesting 
    89	test  by  reconnecting  the matrix board to the cable  and  powering-up  the 
    90	computer.   You may then "type" on the matrix board by touching your fingers 
    91	to the dark panels visible under the surface of the board.  Cute, huh?
    92	   You  will need to practice reassembling the space bar spring  before  you 
    93	try  to put the unit back together.   To do this,  remove the spacebar tubes 
    94	from the tube holder.  Remove the toggle and place it in a safe place.  Note 
    95	the wire running the full length of the space bar tube assembly.   This wire 
    96	is  the spring that keeps the spacebar from tilting to one side during  use.  
    97	When the spacebar is inserted into the tube assembly this wire MUST fit into 
    98	the  slots in the "legs" on each end of the spacebar.   Try it a  few  times 
    99	before you plan to reassemble the keyboard.
   100	   To  reassemble  the keyboard,  replace the spacebar tube assembly in  the 
   101	tube holder.  Install the toggle in its slot.  Insure all other toggles are 
   102	correctly positioned.   Hold the tube holder upside down and GENTLY  replace 
   103	the  matrix board in its place.   To complete reassembly,  you will need  to 
   104	press  the matrix holder down onto the tube holder while sliding the  "ears" 
   105	into their correct notches.  THIS TAKE A LARGE AMOUNT OF FORCE!  BE SURE THE 
   106	UNIT  DOES  NOT JUMP OUT OF YOU HAND!!!   After replacing the matrix  board, 
   107	bend  the holding "ear" into place to secure the mechanism.   Reinstall  the 
   108	key unit into the keyboard case and reconnect the cable.  Replace the bottom 
   109	cover.   You should now check the unit for proper operation.  This is tricky 
   110	without keys, but it can be done.
   111	   To  test the unit,  place the rear edge (nearest the number keys) on  the 
   112	table  with  the front edge (nearest the spacebar) in the  air.   This  will 
   113	allow the springs to fall backwards and insure against false input  signals.  
   114	You may have to shake the keyboard a bit to get the springs to fall.
   115	   Bring the system up and test each key by "tweeking" the spring with your
   116	finger.   (The  IBM diagnostics have a good test for this.)  If all is well, 
   117	replace the keys, WHILE HOLDING THE KEYBOARD IN THIS POSITION!  If you don't
   118	hold  the keyboard up like this,  the springs will be "pre-bent"  and  won't 
   119	function properly.   Replace the spacebar first,  as this is the one that is 
   120	most likely to give you problems.
   121	   The  object of the spacebar replacement game is to get the wire into  the 
   122	slot  on  the  bar legs.   This MUST be done one side  at  a  time,  without 
   123	depressing the bar too much.   Pressing the bar down causes the wire springs 
   124	to  retract  and makes their reinstallation impossible.   You can  tell  the 
   125	spacebar  is installed correctly by the fact that the ends are difficult  to 
   126	lift up and the bar moves vertically as a unit.
   127	   After replacing the spacebar,  replace all the other keys,  WHILE HOLDING 
   128	THE KEYBOARD VERTICAL!  
   129	   Run  the  diagnostics  of the keyboard to insure  everything  is  working 
   130	properly.  If not, check that the small springs were in the correct (leaned-
   131	back)  position when the keys were installed.   If they were and  you  still 
   132	have  problems,  then  you reassembled the matrix board and key tube  holder 
   133	incorrectly and will have to take it apart and start all over again...
   134	   A  common  problem is getting the toggles jammed up when  installing  the 
   135	matrix board.  
   136	
   137	   Hope this was educational -- it sure was a pain to type!  GOOD LUCK!
