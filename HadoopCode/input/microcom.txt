    65	MICROCOM DEBUTS INDUSTRY'S FIRST V.32bis PORTABLE MODEM 
    66	
    67	MicroPorte 4232bis Supports Data Communication Over Cellular and Land-lines
    68	with MNP 10 Adverse Channel Enhancements
    69	
    70	BOSTON, MA (Networld Booth #1508), FEBRUARY 11, 1992 -- Microcom), Inc.,
    71	(Norwood, MA) developer of MNP (Microcom Networking Protocol), today
    72	debuted the MicroPorte 4232bis, the industry's first V.32bis portable
    73	modem. With V.32bis, the MicroPorte 4232bis yields high-speed throughputs
    74	up to 38,400 bps on land-based lines reducing modem connect time,
    75	resulting in substantial line cost savings. In keeping with the Company's
    76	strategy, the MicroPorte 4232bis supports MNP 10 providing enhanced data
    77	transmission reliability over both dial-up and cellular connections.
    78	
    79	The MicroPorte 4232bis has a footprint about the size of an index card,
    80	weighs 10 ounces, and supports the advanced modem features users have come
    81	to expect from Microcom's premium desktop modems.
    82	
    83	"The MicroPorte 4232bis is the only high-speed portable modem that enables
    84	users to communicate virtually anywhere," says Stephen P. Mank, Microcom's
    85	Vice President of Marketing. "Supporting communication over cellular is
    86	particularly important to the increasing number of laptop, notebook,
    87	palmtop and pen computer users who require mobile communication
    88	capabilities. With MNP 10, their connect times are shorter and
    89	communication links more reliable."
    90	
    91	Microcom's MNP 10 gives the MicroPorte 4232bis user a better chance to get
    92	connected and stay connected over poor quality cellular and land-based
    93	links. MNP 10 incorporates four unique functions called Adverse Channel
    94	Enhancements (ACE) that regulate modem speed and packet sizes, optimizing
    95	data transfer under virtually any conditions. MNP 10 initiates a call at
    96	1200 bps, the most robust level, then upshifts to the highest possible
    97	line speed. Throughout the call, MNP 10 monitors various line parameters
    98	and aggressively adapts packet size and shifts modem speed, upward or
    99	downward, providing optimum data throughput.
   100	
   101	In addition to supporting CCITT V.32bis modulation standards and MNP 10,
   102	the MicroPorte 4232bis also supports MNP 2-4 error control, MNP 5 and
   103	V.42bis data compression, and other modulation standards, including V.32
   104	(9600), V.22bis (2400), V.22 (1200 bps), Bell 212A (1200 bps) and Bell 103
   105	(300 bps).
   106	
   107	The MicroPorte 4232bis includes an AC power pack and rechargeable
   108	batteries. Fully charged batteries provide 1.5 hours of connect time. Auto
   109	shut-off conserves battery life when the MicroPorte is not in use. For
   110	mobile computing, users can purchase an optional 12-volt DC adapter that
   111	plugs into a standard automobile cigarette lighter.
   112	
   113	Shipping to authorized Microcom resellers in March 1992, the MicroPorte
   114	4232bis will have a list price of $899.

   116	--------------------------------------------------------
   117	
   118	BOSTON, MA (Networld Booth #1508), February 11, 1992--Microcom, Inc.,
   119	(Norwood, MA) developer of the Microcom Networking Protocol (MNP), the de
   120	facto modem standard, today debuted the QX/4232bis+, the newest member of
   121	its V.32bis modem family. The QX/4232bis+ is ideally suited for users of
   122	high-power PCs and larger systems requiring very high throughput, solid
   123	security and error-free transmission over dial-up or leased lines.
   124	
   125	Enabling users to transfer data at speeds up to 57,600 bps, the QX/4232bis+
   126	eliminates performance bottlenecks that frequently occur when running
   127	complex applications with slower modems. The high-speed QX/4232bis+ also
   128	provides the throughput users require for data-intensive applications
   129	running on midrange, mainframe and supercomputers.
   130	
   131	In addition to 2-wire dial-up operation, the QX/4232bis+ supports 4-wire
   132	leased lines. This preserves users' modem investments as the QX/4232bis+
   133	is compatible with most 4-wire modems.
   134	
   135	If the leased line connection is disrupted, the QX/4232bis+ automatically
   136	switches to a 2-wire dial backup. While in backup mode, the modem
   137	continually monitors the leased line and switches back to 4-wire operation
   138	when the line is restored. Throughout the backup process, the QX/4232bis+
   139	maintains complete data integrity.
   140	
   141	Since many large computer systems are installed in banks, financial
   142	institutions and Fortune 1000 corporations, Microcom designed the
   143	QX/4232bis+ with multiple security modes to protect sensitive financial
   144	and technical data. Sophisticated security features enable users to
   145	program a security database for up to 20 users, selecting fixed dial-back,
   146	variable dial-back or pass-through security, depending upon the user's
   147	needs. Other security features are also provided.
   148	
   149	For both synchronous and asynchronous operation, the QX/4232bis+ provides
   150	CCITT V.25bis dialing commands. This feature is particularly valuable to
   151	users of IBM AS/400 systems, which commonly support V.25bis dialing.
   152	
   153	Following its strategy of providing high-performance capabilities in its
   154	modems, Microcom also includes MNP 10 in the QX/4232bis+. MNP 10 provides
   155	users with an effective solution for communicating data over cellular
   156	networks and other adverse channels such as noisy land lines. MNP 10
   157	enhances modem connectability and adjusts packet size and modem speed to
   158	optimize performance of the QX/4232bis+.
   159	
   160	Other features provided in the QX/4232bis+ include
   161	
   162	ù Auto Logon
   163	. PCS Security
   164	ù Multiple Configurations
   165	. UUCP/Kermit Spoofing
   166	ù Remote Access
   167	ù Auto Dial-back On Loss of Carrier
   168	
   169	Microcom will ship the QX/4232bis+ to authorized dealers by the end of
   170	January 1992. The modem will have a list price of $1099.
   171	
   172	Microcom's other V.32bis modems include the QX/4232bis desktop model and
   173	the recently announced MicroPorte 4232bis portable modem. Both include MNP
   174	10 and provide speeds up to 38,400 bps.
