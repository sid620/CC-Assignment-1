     3	Part I: The Intel 4004 (1972)
     4	
     5	    The first single chip CPU was the Intel 4004, a 4-bit processor meant for
     6	a calculator. It processed data in 4 bits, but its instructions were
     7	8 bits long. Internally, it featured four 12 bit(?) registers which acted as
     8	an internal evaluation stack. The Stack Pointer pointed to one of these
     9	registers, not a memory location (only CALL and RET instructions operated on
    10	the Stack Pointer). There were also sixteen 4-bit (or eight 8-bit) general
    11	purpose registers
    12	    The 4004 had 46 instructions. Intel created an 8-bit version of this, the
    13	8008 (intended for a terminal controller).

    16	Part II: The Intel 4040 and 8080
    17	
    18	    The 4040 was compatible with the 4004 instruction set - the 4040 had 60
    19	instructions, which included the 46 4004 instructions. The 8080 was similar to
    20	the 4040, except being 8 bits wide.
    21	    The 8080 had a 16 bit address bus, and an 8 bit data bus. Internally it
    22	had seven 8 bit registers (six which could also be combined as three 16 bit
    23	registers), a 16 bit stack pointer (the stack was stored in memory, not in an
    24	internal register set), and 16 bit program counter. It also had several I/O
    25	ports - 256 of them, so I/O devices could be hooked up without taking away or
    26	interfering with the addressing space.

    36	COMPUTER ON A CHIP
    37	
    38	   Intel  has  introduced  an  integrated  CPU  complete with
    39	a 4-bit parallel adder, sixteen 4-bit registers, an accumula-
    40	tor  and  a  push-down  stack  on  one  chip.  It's  one of a
    41	family  of  four  new  ICs  which  comprise  the  MCS-4 micro
    42	computer  system--the  first  system  to  bring the power and
    43	flexibility  of  a  dedicated general-purpose computer at low
    44	cost in as few as two dual in-line packages.
    45	    MSC-4   systems   provide  complete  computing  and  con-
    46	trol  functions  for  test  systems,  data terminals, billing
    47	machines,   measuring   systems,   numeric   control  systems
    48	and process control systems.
    49	    The  heart  of  any  MSC-4  system  is  a  Type 4004 CPU,
    50	which  incudes  a  set  of  45  instructions.  Adding  one or
    51	more   Type   4001   ROMs   for   program  storage  and  data
    52	tables   gives  a  fully  functioning  micro-programmed  com-
    53	puter.   Add   Type  4002  RAMs  for  read-write  memory  and
    54	Type 4003 registers to expand the output ports.
    55	   Using  no  curcuitry  other  than  ICs from this family of
    56	four,  a  system  with  4096  8-bit  bytes of ROM storage and
    57	5120   bits   of  RAM  storage  can  be  created.  For  rapid
    58	turn-around  or  only  a  few  systems,  Intel's erasable and
    59	re-programmable   ROM,   Type   1701,   may   be  substituted
    60	for the Type 4001 mask-programmed ROM.
    61	    MCS-4   systems  interface  easily  with  switches,  key-
    62	boards,  displays,  teletypewriters,  printers,  readers, A-D
    63	converters   and  other  popular  peripherals.   For  further
    64	information,  circle the reader service card 87 or call Intel
    65	at (408) 246-7501.
