     5	IF YOU ARE GETTING GARBAGE ON THE SCREEN, OR ARE HAVING TROUBLE
     6	COMPLETING FILE TRANFERS:
     7	
     8	If you see random characters on your screen, or if file transfers involve
     9	many retransmitted blocks or aborts, or if you can only get a good connect
    10	at lower baud rates, then this help info is for you.  There is probably a
    11	problem in either the quality of the phone line connection you have between
    12	your modem and the Exec-PC modem, or your modem has a problem, or there
    13	is a bad modem on Exec-PC.
    14	
    15	FIRST THINGS FIRST:  It is unlikely the modem is bad on Exec-PC.  If we have
    16	a bad modem, our callers tell us about it within a day or two, and we replace
    17	the bad modem.  If you have a consistent connect problem, then it is probably
    18	not caused by a modem on Exec-PC.  Also, if you get the noise problems on more
    19	than one line (node number) of Exec-PC, it is highly unlikely that we have
    20	more than one bad modem here, so the problem lies elsewhere.
    21	
    22	BAD PHONE CONNECTION:  Most of the bad phone noise problems occur on long
    23	distance connections.  We have, however, helped people with bad connections
    24	on LOCAL calls.  You never know when the phone company has provided a marginal
    25	connection until you start getting problems with your modem.  In the worst
    26	case, you will be able to hear the noise on the line if you pick up a phone
    27	and hear scratching or hissing noises.  If you can hear the noise, call the
    28	phone company and insist on a fix.
    29	
    30	LONG DISTANCE PROBLEMS:  The majority of the noise problems come from a poor
    31	quality connection through a long distance service.  Many people tell me, "I
    32	use AT&T, so it is not a problem with the phone service."  Maybe yes, maybe
    33	no.  ALL long distance vendors, including AT&T have variance in the quality of
    34	their service.  When in doubt, try a different vendor.  If you do not know how
    35	to gain access to a different long distance vendor, call your phone company
    36	and have them explain it to you.  It is your legal right to have easy access
    37	to alternative long distance vendors.
    38	
    39	Some people have fixed problems by switching from US Sprint to AT&T, while
    40	others have gained a perfect connection by switching from AT&T to US Sprint,
    41	or to MCI, or to any of the dozen other long distance services.
    42	
    43	MODEM PROBLEMS:  Last but not least, many people have found out their bargain
    44	modem was not such a bargain after all.  If you suspect your modem may have
    45	a problem, it is best to borrow a friends modem and try it in place of your
    46	modem.  If the problem persists, try using a different phone outlet in your
    47	home of office, perhaps a different phone line if another is available.  When
    48	the problem goes away, you know what was causing it.
    49	
    50	If it turns out your modem is causing the poor connects to Exec-PC, then you
    51	should contact the manufacturer, dealer, or distributor of the modem and
    52	describe the problem to them.  Tell them the problem goes away when the modem
    53	is replaced with another modem.  This will convince them to either repair or
    54	replace your modem.
    55	
    56	PC PURSUIT USERS:  Although you may not expect it, PC Pursuit sometimes causes
    57	line noise problems and file transfer problems.  The PCP concept requires
    58	that 4 modems be talking clearly in order to establish a good connection
    59	for you.  From our recent experience, the connections are not always
    60	perfect.  The usual cause of the problem is between your PC and the local
    61	PCP modem you are dialing into.  Some people have fixed the problem by calling
    62	Telenet customer support and asking them for alternate access numbers for
    63	the local Telenet node they are dialing into.
    64	
    65	
    66	
    67	In every case I have encountered in the past 4 years, one of the above
    68	techniques has solved the connect problem.
