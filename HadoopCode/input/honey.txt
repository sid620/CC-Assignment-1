     6	        I'll never forget the day my wife asked me this question,
     7	              for that was the day when all my troubles
     8	began.  My loving wife had heard me talking about the computers I
     9	              work with and decided she would buy me my
    10	very own.  We were both excited about it on Christmas morning
    11	              when I unwrapped it and took it from the box. 
    12	Her excitement began to diminish after I had set it up and slowly
    13	              became familiar with it.  The excitement
    14	level hit bottom when she discovered that there was a lot more to
    15	              these things than just turning them on and
    16	watching them go.  Eventually I was able to build a nice computer
    17	              system starting with what she had bought me
    18	and ending when I had all the peripherals and gadgets I needed. 
    19	              She was careful when picking out a desk, to be
    20	certain it would match the furniture in the living room, which was
    21	              where she had a nice spot picked out for me
    22	to do my computing.  A few years went by and she decided she
    23	              didn't want me in there anymore, so she moved my
    24	desk into the guest bedroom.
    25	
    26	        I wasn't quite as happy in the guest bedroom at first,
    27	              but soon I realized it was working out ok.  If
    28	I had some important computing to do, the television among other
    29	              things wouldn't bother me anymore.  All I had
    30	to do is just close the door.  This bedroom was still a guest
    31	              bedroom complete with a full-sized bed to
    32	accomodate her parents when they come to visit, so it was a
    33	              little crowded.  After a while she began calling it
    34	"your Computer Room".  There was barely enough room to turn
    35	              around in there and my wishes to get a bookcase for
    36	my computer manuals was out of the question.  There just wasn't
    37	              room enough there for it. I offered to carry the
    38	bed down to the basement and make a little room.  She promptly
    39	              asked where her parents would sleep.  My answer
    40	swiftly earned me a knot on the head.
    41	              One day she approached me with some papers which she had
    42	brought home form the office.  They had all
    43	              kinds of fancy printing on them and she said it was done on their
    44	computer at work.  "Honey, can our computer
    45	              do this?", she asked.  I was quick to say, "Of course it will." 
    46	She then began asking me about a few other
    47	              things such as graphics.  She was quick to point out that the
    48	computer at work was so easy to use.  I tried to
    49	              explain that our computer wasn't hard to operate but as it turned
    50	out, their's at work was set up to be fool
    51	              proof and would boot up and load the software by simply turning
    52	on the switch.  Well after I had convinced her
    53	              of our computer's capabilities, she asked me to start it up for
    54	her and show her how to do it.  Altough it
    55	              didn't start up as easy as the work computer, she realized that
    56	she could do some of her work at home.  Well,
    57	             it wasn't long before I was competing with her to use my own
    58	computer.  I decided it would be a good idea to
    59	             get her her own computer asd set it up to be as easy to operate
    60	as the one at her office.  Now, she was doing
    61	             some of her work at home, so this meant that she would need a
    62	nice desk to work at.  Well as mentioned before,
    63	             the room was a little crowded.
    64	Because the room was so crowded, now I sit at my very own
    65	             computer, at my very own desk, in my very
    66	own corner of the basement.  It's a little cold down here, but I
    67	             guess that's good.  I won't have to worry
    68	about my computer overheating.  So take it from me, if your wife
    69	             should ask you, "Can our computer do this?",
    70	tell her anything but the truth.
    71	
    72	                                  Happy Computing!
