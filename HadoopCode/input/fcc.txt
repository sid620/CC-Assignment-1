    12	 FREE LOCAL ACCESS TO PACKET
    13	 SWITCHING NETWORKS MAY BE ELIMINATED
    14	 ------------------------------------
    15	 (BPS) -- The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will vote on a proposal 
    16	to reregulate packet switching networks that, if approved, would eliminate free
    17	local telephone access to those networks.
    18	 "If this occurs, it might eventually double or triple the costs to those using
    19	packet switching networks to access commercial on-line databases and 
    20	information services and triple or quadruple the costs to those using Telenet's 
    21	PC Pursuit," said Philip M. Walker, vice president and regulatory counsel for 
    22	Telenet Communications Corp.
    23	
    24	 Predictably, the initiative to reregulate packet switching networks comes
    25	primarily from the Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) and secondarily from AT&T.
    26	These companies provide local telephone service to vast majority of telephone
    27	customers throughout the U.S. and will benefit the most from FCC reregulation 
    28	of the packet switching networks.
    29	
    30	 Under current FCC rules formulated in 1980 in the FCC's Second Computer
    31	Inquiry, called Computer II, a distinction is made between "basic services" and
    32	"enhanced services." "Basic services" are those that don't offer protocol 
    33	conversion such as local and long-distance voice telephone services.  "Enhanced 
    34	services" are defined in an open-ended fashion as computer-based services that 
    35	are more than a "basic service," in other words, services such as packet 
    36	switching networks, database and on-line type services, and remote computing 
    37	services that offer protocol conversion, according to Walker.
    38	
    39	 Under the 1980 Computer II Inquiry, the FCC ruled that "basic services" would
    40	continue to be regulated as they had always been.  However, the FCC also ruled
    41	that "enhanced services" would be deregulated, which opened up the industry to
    42	competition.  This resulted in numerous companies entering the packet switching
    43	business, including BOCs, AT&T and at least a dozen others.  The competition
    44	resulted in significant price reductions for packet switching services.
    45	 To prevent monopolization of the packet switching industry by the Big Boys 
    46	(the BOCs and AT&T), the FCC ruled that they had to keep separate accounting 
    47	figures for their "basic services" and for their "enhanced services," and that 
    48	they could not use revenues from their lucrative "basic services" to cross- 
    49	subsidize their "enhanced service" packet switching networks.
    50	 The FCC also ruled that if the BOCs and AT&T used their "basic service"
    51	telephone lines for packet switching services, then they must let their
    52	competitors have access to those lines on the same basis, which would preserve
    53	true competition in the industry.
    54	
    55	 "Now, under the FCC's Computer Inquiry III, the FCC is asking, should we
    56	redefine protocol conversion services as 'basic services' rather than enhanced
    57	services?  Should we redefine all those companies as common carriers?  This
    58	would, in effect, subject them not only to federal regulations but, even worse,
    59	to state regulations," Walker said.
    60	 The result would eliminate comparable interconnection requirements currently
    61	imposed on BOCs and AT&T, allowing them to charge their packet switching
    62	competitors local dial-in fees to access packet switching long-distance line
    63	networks. It would also allow BOCs and AT&T to offer their own packet switching 
    64	services on a non-compensatory basis and, finally, allow them to cross- 
    65	subsidize those services with revenues from their much more lucrative voice 
    66	telephone service revenues.  In short, it would allow BOCs and AT&T to 
    67	monopolize the packet switching industry and probably drive out most 
    68	competitors. 
    69	 "In terms of cost impact," Walker said, "if we had to pay local access 
    70	charges, it would cost us about $3.60 an hour at the originating end, for calls 
    71	made by users to on-line databases and information services like CompuServe and 
    72	The Source.
    73	
    74	 "And with PC Pursuit, for which we have out-dial modems, we would have to pay
    75	not only 3.60 per hour access fees at the originating end but also $4.80 at the
    76	terminating end, a total of about $8 or $9.  Obviously, to survive, we would
    77	have to add those additional charges to our current fees and pass them on to 
    78	our consumers," Walker said.
    79	 That would almost certainly spell the end of PC Pursuit, and it would likely
    80	put out of business not only many independent packet switching networks but 
    81	also many on-line databases and information services.
    82	
    83	 FCC approval of changes being considered in Computer III, Walker said, "would
    84	really have a major impact on anyone using a packet switching service to access
    85	online bulletin boards, databases, or information services aimed at the
    86	residential user.  They are just going to get creamed if this happens."
    87	 Walker said that is was not clear exactly when the FCC would vote on the
    88	proposal, but that it would probably be the latter part of January or early 
    89	part of February, 1987.  "They are moving very fast on this," he said.

   100	 "Low-Cost packet switching Service Threatened"
   101	
   102	 by Alan R. Bechtold
   103	
   104	 As described in our lead news story this issue, the FCC is now considering a
   105	major change in the way packet switched phone services are defined.  This 
   106	change
   107	is likely to lead to the demise of many of these services, and to much higher
   108	prices for the use of the few that will eventually remain in business.
   109	
   110	 At the risk of over-simplification, I think I should first describe just what
   111	a packet switched networking service is.  These are the services you use to
   112	access online databases and commercial online services, such as CompuServe and
   113	The Source, with just a local telephone call.  Once you call the local Telenet
   114	or Tymnet number, for example, and a connection is made, you are then connected
   115	with a computer that puts you in communication with the online services with
   116	which you wish to communicate.
   117	
   118	 This computer is handling a number of calls into the main system computer at
   119	the same time.  It takes information you send and delivers it in "packets" to 
   120	the proper destination, picks up information from the online service computer 
   121	you called, and sends it, also in "packets," back to you.  All of this 
   122	communicating is done in these so-called "packets" because this allows the 
   123	network's computers to offer protocol conversion and handle several ongoing 
   124	communications sessions at the same time.
   125	
   126	 FCC regulations allow AT&T and Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) to engage in
   127	packet switching network operations, but they must also maintain completely
   128	separate accounting of their voice and packet switching operations.  They must
   129	also offer free local-calling access to their lines to any competitors engaged
   130	in the packet switching service industry.
   131	
   132	 The above regulations have allowed Telenet and Tymnet, among others, to 
   133	operate at a reasonable cost in a competitive atmosphere.  This is a case of 
   134	regulation of a business actually RESULTING in increased competition and lower 
   135	prices to consumers.
   136	
   137	 As things stand now, you can call any local Telenet or Tymnet access number 
   138	and use these services to inexpensively access such online services as 
   139	CompuServe, The Source, Delphi, and countless others.  In addition, GTE's new 
   140	PC PURSUIT service now offers you access, through their Telenet packet 
   141	switching service, to literally hundreds of local bulletin boards in cities all 
   142	across the country--for a flat charge of $25 per month.
   143	 But, the FCC is now being asked to REREGULATE this segment of the
   144	communications industry, eliminating the FCC requirements that AT&T and BOCs
   145	keep separate accounting records of their voice and packet switching services,
   146	and eliminating the stipulation that the BOCs and AT&T must offer their
   147	competitors in the packet switching business free access to their local
   148	telephone connection lines.
   149	
   150	 The idea is patently ridiculous.
   151	
   152	 Mark Fowler, Chairman of the FCC, has been hailed by the press as a "fair-
   153	market zealot."  The chances are very good that he views this proposed
   154	reregulation as the magic road to increased competition and fairer pricing for
   155	consumers.
   156	 Unofficially, the word is out that the FCC advisory committee now considering
   157	this matter is indeed leaning in favor of the proposed reregulation of the
   158	packet switching industry.  If the committee recommends these changes, it's
   159	likely that a majority of the five voting members on the Federal Communications
   160	Commission will vote in favor of the changes.
   161	
   162	 I have talked to sources within the industry who say it is the BOCs who are
   163	pushing VERY HARD for this reregulation, because they want to get into the
   164	packet switching service business in a big way, and they would like to rid
   165	themselves of needless competition on their way to success.
   166	
   167	 What's that?  RID themselves of competition?  But--the proposed reregulation 
   168	is supposed to FOSTER competition!  Why would a group of companies (BOCs) 
   169	hoping to eliminate their competition PUSH for this reregulation?  I hope the 
   170	answer to THAT question is entirely clear.
   171	 Here we have an industry that is currently populated with plenty of 
   172	competition.  Prices are already reasonable.  Reregulation of the packet
   173	switching service industry will IMMEDIATELY give giant corporations the upper
   174	hand, and will allow them to cut off free access to their local access phone
   175	lines to their competitors, namely Telenet and Tymnet and other similar 
   176	services that now offer you high-quality service, in a competitive marketplace, 
   177	at reasonable prices.
   178	
   179	 The proposed reregulation, however, would force all packet switching services
   180	to compete with the BOCs and AT&T, companies that would be able to use the
   181	enormous profits they earn with their voice telephone services to cross-
   182	subsidize their packet switching services and offer them on a non-compensatory
   183	basis, at least until their competitors are eliminated.  When that happens, 
   184	they are then sure to jack up their fees to any level they want.
   185	
   186	 It would also force their packet switching competitors to pay access fees for
   187	connection to local phone lines.  The access fees alone could add as much as
   188	$4.00 per hour to the fees packet switching companies would be forced to pass 
   189	on to their customers. This will be added to your hourly connect-time charges
   190	for accessing ALL online databases through these services.
   191	 The proposed reregulation could very well spell the death of PC PURSUIT.
   192	Because GTE also uses dial-out modems at the other end of their Telenet
   193	connections for PC PURSUIT service, the company would be forced to pay an 
   194	hourly charge at BOTH ends of the phone line--totaling up to $8 or $9 per 
   195	hour.  These fees would have to be added to the flat $25 per month that GTE now 
   196	charges for access to PC-PURSUIT.  It would simply make the final cost to PC-
   197	PURSUIT customers too high for the service to remain practical and affordable.
   198	 So--this is ONE TIME you MUST use your word processor to produce some letters
   199	opposing this proposed reregulation!  Write to:
   200	
   201	 Honorable Mark Fowler
   202	 Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission
   203	 Washington D.C. 20554
   204	
   205	 Refer to Computer Inquiry III in your letters.  State clearly, in your own
   206	words, that competitive packet switching services should not be reregulated or
   207	subjected to carrier access charges, and then explain why not.  Tell Mr. Fowler
   208	that reregulation of packet switching services will completely destroy the
   209	existing fair market for these services, and eventually increase costs, not
   210	DECREASE them.
   211	
   212	 And hurry!  I have heard this matter will be going before the FCC for a vote 
   213	in the latter part of January or early part of February.  Time is running out.
