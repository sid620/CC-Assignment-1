    42	We should never so entirely avoid danger as to appear
    43	irresolute and cowardly.  But, at the same time, we should
    44	avoid unnecessarily exposing ourselves to danger, than
    45	which nothing can be more foolish.  [Cicero]

    52	Do you trust me?
    53	
    54	If you participate in computer conferencing, and you use
    55	your real name, then you'd better.
    56	
    57	"Why?", you ask.  "What can you do with my name?"  To start
    58	with, given that and your origin line, I can probably look
    59	you up in your local phone book, and find out where you
    60	live.  Even if you are unlisted, there are ways to locate
    61	you based on your name.  If you own any property, or pay any
    62	utility bills, your address is a matter of public record.
    63	Do you have children in the public schools?  It would be
    64	easy to find out.  But that's just the beginning.

    66	Former Chairman of the U.S. Privacy Protection Commission
    67	David F. Linowes, in his book "Privacy in America" (1989),
    68	writes of New York private investigator Irwin Blye:
    69	
    70	    "Challenged to prove his contention that, given a little
    71	    time and his usual fee, he could learn all about an
    72	    individual without even speaking with him, Blye was
    73	    presented with a subject -- a New Jersey
    74	    newspaperman....  The result was a five-page, single-
    75	    spaced, typed report which documented, though not always
    76	    accurately, a wide sweep of the journalist's past, and
    77	    was detailed to the point of disclosing his father's
    78	    income before his retirement."
    79	
    80	Who am I?  If I don't post, you might not even know I exist.
    81	I could be on your local Police Department, or an agent
    82	working with the IRS, or some federal law-enforcement
    83	agency.  I could be a member of some fanatical hate group,
    84	or criminal organization.  I might even be a former Nixon
    85	White-House staffer!
    86	
    87	I could be that pyromaniacal teenager you flamed last
    88	weekend, for posting a step-by-step description of how he
    89	made plastic explosive in his high-school chem lab.  He
    90	seemed kind of mad.
    91	
    92	But you're an upstanding citizen; you have nothing to hide.
    93	So why not use your name on the nets?  Trust me.  There's
    94	nothing to worry about.
    95	
    96	Is there?

   108	      Stupidity is evil waiting to happen.  [Clay Bond]
   109	
   110	
   111	Not long ago in Fidonet's BCSNET echo (the Boston Computer
   112	Society's national conference), the following was posted by
   113	the conference moderator to a user calling himself "Captain
   114	Kirk":
   115	
   116	      "May we ask dear Captain Kirk that it would be very
   117	      polite if you could use your real name in an echomail
   118	      conference? This particular message area is shared
   119	      with BBS's all across the country and everyone else is
   120	      using their real name. It is only common courtesy to
   121	      do so in an echomail conference."
   122	
   123	One of us (mkj) responded with a post questioning that
   124	policy.  Soon the conference had erupted into a heated
   125	debate!  Although mkj had worried that the subject might be
   126	dismissed as trivial, it apparently touched a nerve.  It
   127	brought forth debate over issues and perceptions central to
   128	computer communications in general, and it revealed profound
   129	disparities in fundamental values and assumptions among
   130	participants.
   131	
   132	This article is a response to that debate, and to the
   133	prevailing negative attitudes regarding the use of handles.
   134	Handles seem to have a bad reputation.  Their use is
   135	strangely unpopular, and frequently forbidden by network
   136	authorities.  Many people seem to feel that handles are rude
   137	or dishonest, or that anyone wishing to conceal his or her
   138	identity must be up to no good.  It is the primary purpose
   139	of this article to dispel such prejudices.
   140	
   141	Let us make one thing perfectly clear here at the outset: We
   142	do NOT challenge the need or the right of sysops to know the
   143	identities of their users!  But we do believe that a sysop
   144	who collects user names has a serious responsibility to
   145	protect that information.  This means making sure that no
   146	one has access to the data without a legal warrant, and it
   147	certainly means not pressuring users to broadcast their real
   148	names in widespread public forums such as conferences.

   161	
   162	
   163	Andy Warhol said that "In the future, everyone will be
   164	famous for fifteen minutes".  The computer nets, more than
   165	any other medium, lend credibility to this prediction.  A
   166	network conference may span the globe more completely than
   167	even satellite TV, yet be open to anyone who can afford the
   168	simplest computer and modem. Through our participation in
   169	conferencing, each of us becomes, if only briefly, a public
   170	figure of sorts -- often without realizing it, and without
   171	any contemplation of the implications and possible
   172	consequences.
   173	
   174	
   175	Brian Reid (reid@decwrl.DEC.COM) conducts and distributes
   176	periodic surveys of Usenet conference readership.  His
   177	statistical results for the end of 1991 show that of the
   178	1,459 conferences which currently make up Usenet, more than
   179	fifty percent have over 20,000 readers apiece; the most
   180	popular conferences are each seen by about 200,000 readers!
   181	Mr. Reid's estimate of total Usenet readership is nearly TWO
   182	MILLION people.
   183	
   184	Note that Mr. Reid's numbers are for Usenet only; they do
   185	not include any information on other large public nets such
   186	as RIME (PC-Relaynet), Fido, or dozens of others, nor do
   187	they take into account thousands of private networks which
   188	may have indirect public network connections. The total
   189	number of users with access to public networks is unknown,
   190	but informed estimates range to the tens of millions, and
   191	the number keeps growing at an amazing pace -- in fact, the
   192	rate of growth of this medium may be greater than any other
   193	communications medium in history.
   194	
   195	The special problems and risks which arise when one deals
   196	with a large public audience are something about which most
   197	computer users have little or no experience or
   198	understanding.  Until recently, those of us involved in
   199	computer conferencing have comprised a small and rather
   200	elite community.  The explosion in network participation is
   201	catching us all a little unprepared.
   202	
   203	Among media professionals and celebrities, on the other
   204	hand, the risks of conducting one's business in front of a
   205	public audience are all too familiar.  If the size of one's
   206	audience becomes sufficiently large, one must assume that
   207	examples of virtually every personality type will be
   208	included: police and other agents of various governments,
   209	terrorists, murderers, rapists, religious fanatics, the
   210	mentally ill, robbers and con artists, et al ad infinitum.
   211	It must also be assumed that almost anything you do, no
   212	matter how innocuous, could inspire at least one person,
   213	somewhere, to harbor ill will toward you.
   214	
   215	The near-fatal stabbing of actress Theresa Saldana is a case
   216	in point. As she was walking to her car one morning near her
   217	West Hollywood apartment, a voice behind her asked, "Are you
   218	Theresa Saldana?"; when she turned to answer, a man she had
   219	never seen before pulled out a kitchen knife and stabbed her
   220	repeatedly.
   221	
   222	After her lengthy and painful recovery, she wrote a book on
   223	the experience ("Beyond Survival", 1986).  In that book she
   224	wrote:
   225	
   226	     [pg 12]  "... Detective Kalas informed me that the
   227	     assailant, whom he described as a Scottish drifter, had
   228	     fixated upon me after seeing me in films."
   229	
   230	     [pg 28]  "... it was through my work as an actress that
   231	     the attacker had fixated on me.  Naturally, this made
   232	     me consider getting out of show business ..."
   233	
   234	     [pg 34]  "For security, I adopted an alias and became
   235	     'Alicia Michaels.'  ... during the months that followed
   236	     I grew so accustomed to it that, to this day, I still
   237	     answer reflexively when someone calls the name Alicia!"
   238	
   239	Or consider the fate of Denver radio talk show host Alan
   240	Berg, who in 1984 died outside his home in a hail of
   241	gunfire.  Police believe he was the victim of a local neo-
   242	nazi group who didn't like his politics.
   243	
   244	We are reminded of the murders of John Lennon and Rebecca
   245	Shaffer; the Reagan/Hinckley/Foster incident; and a long
   246	string of other "celebrity attacks" of all sorts, including
   247	such bizarre events as the occupation of David Letterman's
   248	home by a strange woman who claimed to be his wife! There is
   249	probably no one in public life who doesn't receive at least
   250	the occassional threatening letter.
   251	
   252	Of course, ordinary participants in network conferencing may
   253	never attract quite the attention that other types of
   254	celebrities attract. But consider the following, rather less
   255	apocalyptic scenarios:
   256	
   257	    --  On Friday night you post a message to a public
   258	        conference defending an unpopular or controversial
   259	        viewpoint.  On Monday morning your biggest client
   260	        cancels a major contract. Or you are kept up all
   261	        night by repeated telephone calls from someone
   262	        demanding that you "stop killing babies"!
   263	
   264	    --  You buy your teenage son or daughter a computer and
   265	        modem.  Sometime later you find your lawn littered
   266	        with beer bottles and dug up with tire marks, or
   267	        your home vandalized or burglarized.
   268	
   269	    --  One day you are nominated to the Supreme Court.  Who
   270	        are all these strange people on TV claiming to be
   271	        your friends? How did that fellow know your position
   272	        on abortion?  Your taste in GIFs?
   273	
   274	Celebrities and other professional media personalities
   275	accept the risks and sacrifices of notoriety, along with the
   276	benefits, as part of their chosen careers.  Should computer
   277	conference participants be expected to do the same?  And who
   278	should be making these decisions?

   289	
   290	
   291	Older media seem to address the problems of privacy very
   292	differently than computer media, at least so far.  We are
   293	not aware of ANY medium or publication, apart from computer
   294	conferencing, where amateur or even most professional
   295	participants are required to expose their true names against
   296	their will.  Even celebrities frequently use "stage names",
   297	and protect their addresses and phone numbers as best they
   298	can.
   299	
   300	When a medium caters specifically to the general public,
   301	participants are typically given even greater opportunities
   302	to protect their privacy. Television talk shows have been
   303	known to go so far as to employ silhouetting and electronic
   304	alteration of voices to protect the identities of guests,
   305	and audience members who participate are certainly not
   306	required to state their full names before speaking.
   307	
   308	The traditional medium most analogous to computer
   309	conferencing may be talk radio.  Like conferencing, talk
   310	radio is a group discussion and debate medium oriented
   311	toward controversy, where emotions can run high. Programs
   312	often center around a specific topic, and are always run by
   313	a "host" whose role seems analogous in many respects to that
   314	of a conference moderator.  It is therefore worth noting
   315	that in talk radio generally, policy seems to be that
   316	callers are identified on the air only by their first names
   317	(unless of course they volunteer more).
   318	
   319	Finally, of course, authors have published under "pen names"
   320	since the dawn of publishing, and newspapers and magazines
   321	frequently publish letters to the editor with "name and
   322	address withheld by request" as the signature line. Even
   323	founding fathers Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John
   324	Jay, in authoring the seminal Federalist Papers in 1787 for
   325	publication in the Letters columns of various New York City
   326	newspapers, concealed their identities behind the now-famous
   327	psuedonym "Publius".
   328	
   329	What would you think if someone called a radio talk show
   330	demanding to know the identity of a previous caller?  Such a
   331	demand would undoubtedly be seen as menacing and
   332	inappropriate in that context.  Yet that same demand seems
   333	to arise without much challenge each time a handle shows up
   334	in a computer conference.  The authors of this article feel
   335	that such demands should always be looked upon as
   336	suspicious, and that it would be beneficial for moderators
   337	to take upon themselves the responsibility of making sure
   338	that besieged handle-users are aware of their right to
   339	refuse such inappropriate demands.
   340	
   341	It is reasonable to assume that privacy policies in
   342	traditional media are the result of hard-won wisdom gained
   343	from long experience.  Are we so arrogant that we cannot
   344	learn from others?  It is not hard to imagine the sorts of
   345	problems and experiences which shaped these policies in the
   346	old media.  Will we have to wait for similar problems to
   347	occur on the computer networks before we learn?

   359	        In an effort to identify people who fail to file tax
   360	        returns, the Internal Revenue Service is matching

   362	        addresses of U.S. citizens who have purchased
   363	        computers for home use. The IRS continues to seek
   364	        out sources for such information. This information
   365	        is matched against the IRS master file of taxpayers
   366	        to see if those who have not filed can be
   367	        identified.

   374	        I just had an interesting visit from the FBI.  It
   375	        seems that a posting I made to sci.space several
   376	        months ago had filtered through channels, caused the
   377	        FBI to open (or re-open) a file on me, and an agent
   378	        wanted to interview me, which I did voluntarily...
   379	        I then went on to tell him about the controversy

   389	        equipment.  The suspect reportedly operated a 650-
   390	        subscriber bulletin board called "BEN," which is
   391	        described as "geared largely to a gay/leather/S&M
   392	        crowd."  It is not clear what the board's seizure is
   393	        supposed to have accomplished, but the board is now
   394	        shut down, and the identities and messages of its
   395	        users are in the hands of the police.

   408	It would surprise most of us to learn that America is
   409	currently among the premiere surveillance nations in the
   410	world, but such, sadly, is indeed the case.  Our leadership
   411	in technology has helped the U.S. government to amass as
   412	much information on its citizens as almost any other nation
   413	in history, totalitarian or otherwise.  And to make matters
   414	worse, a consumer surveillance behemoth has sprung up
   415	consisting of huge private data-collection agencies which
   416	cater to business.
   417	
   418	As Evan Hendricks, editor of "Privacy Times" (a Washington
   419	D.C.-based newsletter) has put it: "You go through life
   420	dropping bits and pieces of information about yourself
   421	everywhere.  Most people don't realize there are big vacuum
   422	cleaners out there sucking it all up."  [Wall Street
   423	Journal, March 14, 1991].
   424	
   425	To get an idea of how much of your privacy has already been
   426	lost, consider the bits and pieces of information about
   427	yourself which are already available to investigators, and
   428	how thoroughly someone might come to know you by these clues
   429	alone.
   430	
   431	A person's lifestyle and personality are largely described,
   432	for example, by his or her purchases and expenses; from your
   433	checking account records -- which banks are required by law
   434	to keep and make available to government investigators -- a
   435	substantial portrait of your life will emerge. Credit card
   436	records may reveal much of the same information, and can
   437	also be used to track your movements. (In a recent case,
   438	"missing" Massachusetts State Representative Timothy O'Leary
   439	was tracked by credit-card transactions as he fled across
   440	the country, and his movements were reported on the nightly
   441	news!)
   442	
   443	Then there are your school records, which include IQ and
   444	other test results, comments on your "socialization" by
   445	teachers and others, and may reveal family finances in great
   446	detail.  Employment and tax records reveal your present
   447	income, as well as personal comments by employers and co-
   448	workers.  Your properties are another public record of your
   449	income and lifestyle, and possibly your social status as
   450	well. Telephone billing records reveal your personal and
   451	business associations in more detail. Insurance records
   452	reveal personal and family health histories and treatments.
   453	
   454	All of this information is commonly accessed by government
   455	and private or corporate investigators.  And this list is
   456	far from exhaustive!
   457	
   458	Now consider how easily the computer networks lend
   459	themselves to even further erosions of personal privacy. The
   460	actual contents of our mail and telephone traffic have up to
   461	now been subjected to deliberate scrutiny only under
   462	extraordinary conditions. This built-in safety is due
   463	0primarily to the difficulty and expense of conducting
   464	surveillance in these media, which usually requires extended
   465	human intervention. But in the medium of computer
   466	communications, most surveillance can be conducted using
   467	automated monitoring techniques. Tools currently available
   468	make it possible and even cost-effective for government and
   469	other interests to monitor virtually everything which
   470	happens here.
   471	
   472	Why would anyone want to monitor network users?  It is well
   473	documented that, throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the FBI and
   474	other agencies of government, in operations such as the
   475	infamous COINTELPRO among others, spent a great deal of time
   476	and effort collecting vast lists of names. As Computer
   477	Underground Digest moderators Jim Thomas and Gordon Meyer
   478	recalled in a recent commentary (CuD #3.42):
   479	
   480	    "A 1977 class action suit against the Michigan State
   481	    Police learned, through FOIA requests, that state and
   482	    federal agents would peruse letters to the editor of
   483	    newspapers and collect clippings of those whose politics
   484	    they did not like. These news clippings became the basis
   485	    of files on those persons that found there way into the
   486	    hands of other agencies and employers."
   487	
   488	To get onto one of these government "enemies" lists, you
   489	often needed to do nothing more than telephone an
   490	organization under surveillance, or subscribe to the "wrong"
   491	types of magazines and newspapers. Groups engaged in
   492	political activism, including environmental and women's
   493	rights organizations, were commonly infiltrated.  The sort
   494	of investi-gative reporting which uncovered these lists and
   495	surveillances back in the '60s and '70s is now rare, but
   496	there is little reason to assume that such activities have
   497	ceased or even slowed.  In fact, progressive computerization
   498	of local police LEIU activities (Law Enforcement
   499	Intelligence Units, commonly known as "red squads") suggests
   500	that such activities may have greatly increased.
   501	
   502	Within the realm of computer conferencing especially, there
   503	is ample reason to believe that systematic monitoring is
   504	being conducted by government and law-enforcement
   505	organizations, and perhaps by other hostile interests as
   506	well.  In a recent issue of Telecom Digest
   507	(comp.dcom.telecom), Craig Neidorf (knight@EFF.ORG) reported
   508	on the results of a recent Freedom of Information Act
   509	request for documents from the Secret Service:
   510	
   511	    " ... The documents also show that the Secret Service
   512	    established a computer database to keep track of
   513	    suspected computer hackers.  This database contains
   514	    records of names, aliases, addresses, phone numbers,
   515	    known associates, a list of activities, and various
   516	    [conference postings] associated with each individual."
   517	
   518	But the privacy issues which surround computer
   519	communications go far beyond the collection of user lists.
   520	Both government and industry have long pursued the elusive
   521	grail of personality profiling on citizens and consumers. Up
   522	to now, such ambitions have been restrained by the practical
   523	difficulty and expense of collecting and analyzing large
   524	amounts of information on large numbers of citizens.  But
   525	computer communications, more than any other technology,
   526	seems to hold out the promise that this unholy grail may
   527	finally be in sight.
   528	
   529	To coin a phrase, never has so much been known by so few
   530	about so many. The information commonly available to
   531	government and industry investi-gators today is sufficient
   532	to make reliable predictions about our personalities,
   533	health, politics, future behavior, our vulnerabilities,
   534	perhaps even about our innermost thoughts and feelings.  The
   535	privacy we all take for granted is, in fact, largely an
   536	illusion; it no longer exists in most walks of life.  If we
   537	wish to preserve even the most basic minimum of personal
   538	privacy, it seems clear that we need to take far better care
   539	on the networks than we have taken elsewhere.

   549	
   550	
   551	        Human beings are the only species with a history.
   552	        Whether they also have a future is not so obvious.
   553	        The answer will lie in the prospects for popular
   554	        movements, with firm roots among all sectors of the
   555	        population, dedicated to values that are suppressed
   556	        or driven to the margins within the existing social
   557	        and political order...
   558	                                [Noam Chomsky]
   559	
   560	
   561	In your day-to-day social interactions, as you deal with
   562	employers, clients, public officials, friends, acquaintances
   563	and total strangers, how often do you feel you can really
   564	speak freely?  How comfortable are you discussing
   565	controversial issues such as religion, taxes, politics,
   566	racism, sexuality, abortion or AIDS, for example?  Would you
   567	consider it appropriate or wise to express an honest opinion
   568	on such an issue to your boss, or a client?  To your
   569	neighbors?
   570	
   571	Most of us confine such candid discussions to certain
   572	"trusted" social contexts, such as when we are among our
   573	closest friends.  But when you post to a network conference,
   574	your boss, your clients, and your neighbors may very well
   575	read what you post -- if they are not on the nets today,
   576	they probably will be soon, as will nearly everyone.
   577	
   578	If we have to consider each post's possible impact on our
   579	social and professional reputations, on our job security and
   580	income, on our family's acceptance and safety in the
   581	community, it could be reckless indeed to express ourselves
   582	freely on the nets.  Yet conferences are often geared to
   583	controversy, and inhibitions on the free expression of
   584	opinions can reduce traffic to a trickle, killing off an
   585	important conference topic or distorting a valuable sampling
   586	of public opinion.
   587	
   588	More important still is the role computer networks are
   589	beginning to play in the free and open dissemination of news
   590	and information. Democracy is crippled if dissent and
   591	diversity in the media are compromised; yet even here in the
   592	U.S., where a "free press" is a cherished tradition, the
   593	bulk of all the media is owned by a small (and ever-
   594	shrinking) number of corporations, whose relatively narrow
   595	culture, interests and perspec-tives largely shape the
   596	public perception.
   597	
   598	Computer communication, on the other hand, is by its nature
   599	very difficult to control or shape.  Its resources are
   600	scattered; when one BBS goes bust (or is busted!), three
   601	others spring up in its place.  The natural resiliency of
   602	computer communications (and other new, decentral-ized
   603	information technologies such as fax, consumer camcorders
   604	and cheap satellite links) is giving rise to a new brand of
   605	global "guerrilla journalism" which includes everyone, and
   606	defies efforts at suppression.
   607	
   608	The power and value of this new journalistic freedom has
   609	recently shown itself during the Gulf War, and throughout
   610	Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, as well as within the
   611	U.S.  Just think of the depth and detail of information
   612	available on the nets regarding the Secret Service's recent
   613	"Operation Sundevil" and associated activities, compared to
   614	the grossly distorted, blatantly propagandistic coverage of
   615	those same activities given to the general public through
   616	the traditional media.
   617	
   618	Historically, established power and wealth have seldom been
   619	disposed to tolerate uncontrolled media, and recent events
   620	in this country and elsewhere show that computer media are
   621	sometimes seen as threats to established interests as well.
   622	To understand the role of handles in this context, it is
   623	useful to note the flurries of anti-handle sentiment which
   624	have arisen in the wake of crackdowns such as Sundevil, or
   625	the Tom Tcimpidis raid in the early 1980s.  Although few
   626	charges and fewer convictions have typically resulted from
   627	such operations, one might be tempted to speculate that the
   628	real purposes -- to terrorize the nets and chill freedoms of
   629	speech and assembly thereon -- have been achieved.
   630	
   631	In this way, sysops and moderators become unwitting
   632	accomplices in the supression of freedom on the networks.
   633	When real name requirements are instituted, anyone who fears
   634	retaliation of any sort, by any group, will have to fear
   635	participation in the nets; hence content is effectively
   636	controlled.  This consideration becomes especially important
   637	as the nets expand into even more violent and repressive
   638	countries outside the U.S.
   639	
   640	We must decide whether freedom of information and open
   641	public discussion are in fact among the goals of network
   642	conferencing, and if so, whether handles have a role in
   643	achieving these goals.  As access to the networks grows, we
   644	have a rare opportunity to frustrate the efforts of
   645	governments and corporations to control the public mind!  In
   646	this way above all others, computers may have the potential
   647	to shape the future of all mankind for the better.

   655	                      A CALL TO ACTION
   656	                      ----------------
   657	
   658	
   659	       The move to electronic communication may be a turning
   660	       point that history will remember.  Just as in
   661	       seventeenth and eighteenth century Great Britain and
   662	       America a few tracts and acts set precedents for
   663	       print by which we live today, so what we think and do
   664	       today may frame the information system for a
   665	       substantial period in the future.
   666	        [Ithiel de Sola Pool, "Technologies of Freedom", 1983]
   667	
   668	
   669	There was a time when anybody with some gear and a few
   670	batteries could become a radio broadcaster -- no license
   671	required.  There was a time when anyone with a sense of
   672	adventure could buy a plane, and maybe get a contract to
   673	carry mail.  Those early technological pioneers were
   674	probably unable to imagine the world as it is today, but
   675	their influence is strongly felt in current laws,
   676	regulations and policies with roots in the traditions and
   677	philosophies they founded and shaped.
   678	
   679	Today the new pioneers are knitting the world together with
   680	computers, and the world is changing faster than ever.  Law
   681	and ethics are scrambling to keep up.  How far will this
   682	growth take us?  No one can say for sure.  But you don't
   683	need a crystal ball to see that computer communications has
   684	the potential to encompass and surpass all the functionality
   685	of prior media -- print, post, telegraph, telephone, radio
   686	and television -- and more.  It seems reasonable to assume
   687	that computer communications will be at least as ubiquitous
   688	and important in the lives of our grandchildren as all the
   689	older media have been in ours.
   690	
   691	It will be a world whose outlines we can now make out only
   692	dimly.  But the foundations of that world are being built
   693	today by those of us exploring and homesteading on the
   694	electronic frontier.  We need to look hard at what it will
   695	take to survive in the information age.
   696	
   697	In this article we have attempted to show, for one very
   698	narrow issue, what some of the stakes may be in this future-
   699	building game.  But the risks associated with exposing your
   700	name in a computer conference are not well defined, and
   701	various people will no doubt assess the importance of these
   702	risks differently.  After all, most of us take risks every
   703	day which are probably greater than the risks associated
   704	with conferencing. We drive on the expressway.  We eat
   705	sushi.  To some people, the risks of conferencing may seem
   706	terrifying; to others, insignificant.
   707	
   708	But let us not get side-tracked into unresolvable arguments
   709	on the matter.  The real issue here is not how dangerous
   710	conferencing may or may not be; it is whether you and I will
   711	be able to make our own decisions, and protect ourselves (or
   712	not) as we see fit.  The obvious answer is that users must
   713	exercise their collective power to advance their own
   714	interests, and to pressure sysops and moderators to become
   715	more sensitive to user concerns.
   716	
   717	To help in that effort, we would like to recommend the
   718	following guidelines for user action:
   719	
   720	    --  Bear in mind John Perry Barlow's observation that
   721	        "Liberties are preserved by using them".  Let your
   722	        sysop know that you would prefer to be using a
   723	        handle, and use one wherever you can.
   724	
   725	    --  Try to support boards and conferences which allow
   726	        handles, and avoid those which don't.
   727	
   728	    --  When using a handle, BEHAVE RESPONSIBLY!  There will
   729	        always be irresponsible users on the nets, and they
   730	        will always use handles.  It is important for the
   731	        rest of us to fight common anti-handle prejudices by
   732	        showing that handles are NOT always the mark of an
   733	        irresponsible user!
   734	
   735	    --  Educate others about the importance of handles (but
   736	        NEVER argue or flame anyone about it).
   737	
   738	To sysops and moderators: We ask you to bear in mind that
   739	authority is often used best where it is used least.  Grant
   740	users the right to engage in any harmless and responsible
   741	behaviors they choose.  Protect your interests in ways which
   742	tread as lightly as possible upon the interests of others.
   743	The liberties you preserve may be your own!
   744	
   745	In building the computer forums of today, we are building
   746	the social fabric of tomorrow.  If we wish to preserve the
   747	free and open atmosphere which has made computer networking
   748	a powerful force, while at the same time taking care against
   749	the risks inherent in such a force, handles seem to be a
   750	remarkably harmless, entertaining and effective tool to help
   751	us.  Let's not throw that tool away.
   752
