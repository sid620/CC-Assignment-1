     1	CUPERTINO, Calif. -- January 20,1992 -- Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ:SYMC)
     2	today announced The Norton pcANYWHERE version 4.5 and The Norton
     3	pcANYWHERE/LAN version 4.5 with remote control for both Windows 3.0 and
     4	DOS. Norton pcANYWHERE offers fast, flexible PC-to-PC remote computing via
     5	serial or modem connections. Norton pcANYWHERE/LAN provides PC-to-PC
     6	remote computing across a network and to and from a network via serial or
     7	modem connections. Both products have been enhanced to control a host PC
     8	running Windows 3.0 in real, standard or 386 enhanced mode and include
     9	full mouse support for both DOS and Windows applications.
    10	
    11	"The Norton pcANYWHERE version 4.5 brings superior technology to remote
    12	computing," said Gordon E. Eubanks, Jr., chairman, president and CEO.
    13	"Greater reliability, faster speed and optimization of Windows 3.0 remote
    14	control make version 4.5 the leading remote computing software
    15	available."
    16	
    17	Key Features 
    18	============
    19	Support for Windows 3.0 
    20	
    21	Norton pcANYWHERE has been enhanced to provide remote control of Windows
    22	3.0. Due to proprietary technology, Norton pcANYWHERE optimizes and
    23	simplifies the remote operation of Windows 3.0. Version 4.5 enables users
    24	to control a host PC running Windows 3.0 in real, standard or 386 enhanced
    25	mode and includes full mouse support for both DOS and Windows
    26	applications.
    27	
    28	Reliability 
    29	
    30	Reliability is especially important when the host PC is not directly
    31	visible nor easily accessible to the remote user. Because the quality of
    32	the phone line is critical, Norton pcANYWHERE is designed to recover from
    33	phone line errors and to sustain the integrity of connections even under
    34	noisy line conditions.
    35	
    36	Ease of Use 
    37	
    38	A new Quick Connect feature has been added to Norton pcANYWHERE. Quick
    39	Connect simplifies the connection process by reducing the parameters
    40	necessary to set when connecting to the host PC. The number of steps have
    41	been reduced from 15 to as low as 2 using user defined parameters.
    42	
    43	Communications Flexibility 
    44	
    45	Norton pcANYWARE includes a complete set of general communications
    46	functions. Popular terminal emulations such as ANSI, DEC, IBM and Data
    47	General, as well as file transfer protocols such as ASCII, XMODEM, YMODEM
    48	and Kermit, provide users with greater flexibility. These communications
    49	functions make it easier to connect to public mail, bulletin board
    50	services and when accessing minis and mainframes.
    51	
    52	Leading Technology 
    53	
    54	The new, completely comprehensive script language enables users to automate
    55	general communications and avoid the need for user intervention.
    56	High-speed file transfers can be implemented in the foreground or
    57	background. Remote users can transfer files without interfering with
    58	on-going host computer processing. In addition, over 90 drivers for
    59	specific modems now exist, taking complete advantage of specific modem
    60	capabilities.
    61	
    62	Norton pcANYWHERE/LAN also provides a gateway for non-dedicated
    63	communications servers. The LAN version is compatible with any
    64	asynchronous communications server that follows the NASI/NCSI interface
    65	such as Novell's NACS and Network Products
    66	
    67	Speed 
    68	
    69	Norton pcANYWHERE runs at speeds of up to 115,200 bits per second, making
    70	it the perfect match for high-speed modems and super-fast ISDN digital
    71	phone networks.
    72	
    73	Pricing and Availability 
    74	
    75	Norton pcANYWHERE version 4.5 is offered as an integrated product of the
    76	Host PC and Remote PC software or as two separate stand alone products.
    77	Purchased as one integrated product, Norton pcANYWHERE includes host and
    78	remote communication software necessary to establish remote computing
    79	capabilities. Purchased separately, Norton pcANYWHERE Host PC and Norton
    80	pcANYWHERE Remote PC allow additional systems to be added to the remote
    81	computing environment.
    82	
    83	Both pcANYWHERE products are available now through Symantec's network of
    84	distributors and resellers. The suggested retail price for Norton
    85	pcANYWHERE is $179. Norton pcANYWHERE/LAN, which includes network software
    86	and licenses for two nodes, is available for $495.
