     3	ORBITAL MANEUVERING SYSTEM
     4	
     5	The orbital maneuvering system provides the thrust for orbit
     6	insertion, orbit circularization, orbit transfer, rendezvous, deorbit,
     7	abort to orbit and abort once around and can provide up to 1,000
     8	pounds of propellant to the aft reaction control system.  The OMS is
     9	housed in two independent pods located on each side of the orbiter's
    10	aft fuselage.  The pods also house the aft RCS and are referred to as
    11	the OMS/RCS pods.  Each pod contains one OMS engine and the hardware
    12	needed to pressurize, store and distribute the propellants to perform
    13	the velocity maneuvers.  The two pods provide redundancy for the OMS.
    14	The vehicle velocity required for orbital adjustments is approximately
    15	2 feet per second for each nautical mile of altitude change.
    16	
    17	The ascent profile of a mission determines if one or two OMS thrusting
    18	periods are used and the interactions of the RCS.  After main engine
    19	cutoff, the RCS thrusters in the forward and aft RCS pods are used to
    20	provide attitude hold until external tank separation.  At ET
    21	separation, the RCS provides a minus (negative) Z translation maneuver
    22	of about minus 4 feet per second to maneuver the orbiter away from the
    23	ET.  Upon completion of the translation, the RCS provides orbiter
    24	attitude hold until time to maneuver to the OMS-1 thrusting attitude.
    25	The targeting data for the OMS-1 thrusting period is selected before
    26	launch; however, the target data in the onboard general-purpose
    27	computers can be modified by the flight crew via the cathode ray tube
    28	keyboard, if necessary, before the OMS thrusting period.
    29	
    30	During the first OMS thrusting period, both OMS engines are used to
    31	raise the orbiter to a predetermined elliptical orbit.  During the
    32	thrusting period, vehicle attitude is maintained by gimbaling
    33	(swiveling) the OMS engines.  The RCS will not normally come into
    34	operation during an OMS thrusting period.  If, during an OMS thrusting
    35	period, the OMS gimbal rate or gimbal limits are exceeded, RCS
    36	attitude control is required.  If only one OMS engine is used during
    37	an OMS thrusting period, RCS roll control is required.
    38	
    39	During the OMS-1 thrusting period, the liquid oxygen and liquid
    40	hydrogen trapped in the main propulsion system ducts are dumped.  The
    41	liquid oxygen is dumped out through the space shuttle main engines'
    42	combustion chambers and the liquid hydrogen is dumped through the
    43	starboard (right) side T-0 umbilical overboard fill and drain.  This
    44	velocity was precomputed in conjunction with the OMS-1 thrusting
    45	period.
    46	
    47	Upon completion of the OMS-1 thrusting period, the RCS is used to null
    48	any residual velocities, if required.  The flight crew uses the
    49	rotational hand controller and/or translational hand controller to
    50	command the applicable RCS thrusters to null the residual velocities.
    51	The RCS then provides attitude hold until time to maneuver to the
    52	OMS-2 thrusting attitude.
    53	
    54	The second OMS thrusting period using both OMS engines occurs near the
    55	apogee of the orbit established by the OMS-1 thrusting period and is
    56	used to circularize the predetermined orbit for that mission.  The
    57	targeting data for the OMS-2 thrusting period is selected before
    58	launch; however, the target data in the onboard GPCs can be modified
    59	by the flight crew via the CRT keyboard, if necessary, before the OMS
    60	thrusting period.
    61	
    62	Upon completion of the OMS-2 thrusting period, the RCS is used to null
    63	any residual velocities, if required, in the same manner as during
    64	OMS-1.  The RCS is then used to provide attitude hold and minor
    65	translation maneuvers as required for on-orbit operations.  The flight
    66	crew can select primary or vernier RCS thrusters for attitude control
    67	on orbit.  Normally, the vernier RCS thrusters are selected for
    68	on-orbit attitude hold.
    69	
    70	If the ascent profile for a mission uses a single OMS thrusting
    71	maneuver, it is referred to as direct insertion.  In a
    72	direct-insertion ascent profile, the OMS-1 thrusting period after main
    73	engine cutoff is eliminated and is replaced with a 5-feet- per-second
    74	RCS translation maneuver to facilitate the main propulsion system
    75	dump.  The RCS provides attitude hold after the translation maneuver.
    76	The OMS-2 thrusting period is then used to achieve orbit insertion.
    77	The direct-insertion ascent profile allows the MPS to provide more
    78	energy to orbit insertion and permits easier use of onboard software.
    79	
    80	Additional OMS thrusting periods using both or one OMS engine are
    81	performed on orbit according to the mission's requirements to modify
    82	the orbit for rendezvous, payload deployment or transfer to another
    83	orbit.
    84	
    85	The two OMS engines are used to deorbit.  Target data for the deorbit
    86	maneuver is computed by the ground and loaded in the onboard GPCs via
    87	uplink.  This data is also voiced to the flight crew for verification
    88	of loaded values.  After verification of the deorbit data, the flight
    89	crew initiates an OMS gimbal test on the CRT keyboard unit.
    90	
    91	Before the deorbit thrusting period, the flight crew maneuvers the
    92	spacecraft to the desired deorbit thrusting attitude using the
    93	rotational hand controller and RCS thrusters.  Upon completion of the
    94	OMS thrusting period, the RCS is used to null any residual velocities,
    95	if required.  The spacecraft is then maneuvered to the proper entry
    96	interface attitude using the RCS.  The remaining propellants aboard
    97	the forward RCS are dumped by burning the propellants through the
    98	forward RCS thrusters before the entry interface if it is necessary to
    99	control the orbiter's center of gravity.
   100	
   101	The aft RCS plus X jets can be used to complete any planned OMS
   102	thrusting period in the event of an OMS engine failure.  In this case,
   103	the OMS-to-aft-RCS interconnect would feed OMS propellants to the aft
   104	RCS.
   105	
   106	From entry interface at 400,000 feet, the orbiter is controlled in
   107	roll, pitch and yaw with the aft RCS thrusters.  The orbiter's
   108	ailerons become effective at a dynamic pressure of 10 pounds per
   109	square foot, and the aft RCS roll jets are deactivated.  At a dynamic
   110	pressure of 20 pounds per square foot, the orbiter's elevons become
   111	effective, and the aft RCS pitch jets are deactivated.  The rudder is
   112	activated at Mach 3.5, and the aft RCS yaw jets are deactivated at
   113	Mach 1 and approximately 45,000 feet.
   114	
   115	The OMS in each pod consists of a high-pressure gaseous helium storage
   116	tank, helium isolation valves, dual pressure regulation systems, vapor
   117	isolation valves for only the oxidizer regulated helium pressure path,
   118	quad check valves, a fuel tank, an oxidizer tank, a propellant
   119	distribution system consisting of tank isolation valves, crossfeed
   120	valves, and an OMS engine.  Each OMS engine also has a gaseous
   121	nitrogen storage tank, gaseous nitrogen pressure isolation valve,
   122	gaseous nitrogen accumulator, bipropellant solenoid control valves and
   123	actuators that control bipropellant ball valves, and purge valves.
   124	
   125	In each of the OMS pods, gaseous helium pressure is supplied to helium
   126	isolation valves and dual pressure regulators, which supply regulated
   127	helium pressure to the fuel and oxidizer tanks.  The fuel is
   128	monomethyl hydrazine and the oxidizer is nitrogen tetroxide.  The
   129	propellants are Earth-storable liquids at normal temperatures.  They
   130	are pressure-fed to the propellant distribution system through tank
   131	isolation valves to the OMS engines.  The OMS engine propellant ball
   132	valves are positioned by the gaseous nitrogen system and control the
   133	flow of propellants into the engine.  The fuel is directed first
   134	through the engine combustion chamber walls and provides regenerative
   135	cooling of the chamber walls; it then flows into the engine injector.
   136	The oxidizer goes directly to the engine injector.  The propellants
   137	are sprayed into the combustion chamber, where they atomize and ignite
   138	upon contact with each other (hypergolic), producing a hot gas and,
   139	thus, thrust.
   140	
   141	The gaseous nitrogen system is also used after the OMS engines are
   142	shut down to purge residual fuel from the injector and combustion
   143	chamber, permitting safe restarting of the engines.  The nozzle
   144	extension of each OMS engine is radiation-cooled and is constructed of
   145	columbium alloy.
   146	
   147	Each OMS engine produces 6,000 pounds of thrust.  The oxidizer-to-fuel
   148	ratio is 1.65-to-1.  The expansion ratio of the nozzle exit to the
   149	throat is 55-to-1.  The chamber pressure of the engine is 125 psia.
   150	The dry weight of each engine is 260 pounds.
   151	
   152	Each OMS engine can be reused for 100 missions and is capable of 1,000
   153	starts and 15 hours of cumulative firing.  The minimum duration of an
   154	OMS engine firing is two seconds.  The OMS may be utilized to provide
   155	thrust above 70,000 feet.  For vehicle velocity changes of between 3
   156	and 6 feet per second, normally only one OMS engine is used.
   157	
   158	Each engine has two electromechanical gimbal actuators, which control
   159	the OMS engine thrust direction in pitch and yaw (thrust vector
   160	control).  The OMS engines can be used singularly by directing the
   161	thrust vector through the orbiter center of gravity or together by
   162	directing the thrust vector of each engine parallel to the other.
   163	During a two-OMS-engine thrusting period, the RCS will come into
   164	operation only if the OMS gimbal rate or gimbal limits are exceeded
   165	and should not normally come into operation during the OMS thrust
   166	period.  However, during a one-OMS-engine thrusting period, roll RCS
   167	control is required.  The pitch and yaw actuators are identical except
   168	for the stroke length and contain redundant electrical channels
   169	(active and standby), which couple to a common mechanical drive
   170	assembly.
   171	
   172	The OMS/RCS pods are designed to be reused for up to 100 missions with
   173	only minor repair, refurbishment and maintenance.  The pods are
   174	removable to facilitate orbiter turnaround, if required.

   179	HELIUM PRESSURIZATION.
   180	
   181	Each pod pressurization system consists of a helium tank, two helium
   182	isolation valves, two dual pressure regulator assemblies, parallel
   183	vapor isolation valves on the regulated helium pressure to the
   184	oxidizer tank only, dual series-parallel check valve assemblies and
   185	pressure relief valves.
   186	
   187	The helium storage tank in each pod has a titanium liner with a
   188	fiberglass structural overwrap.  This increases safety and decreases
   189	the weight of the tank 32 percent over that of conventional tanks.
   190	The helium tank is 40.2 inches in diameter and has a volume of 17.03
   191	cubic feet minimum.  Its dry weight is 272 pounds.  The helium tank's
   192	operating pressure range is 4,800 to 460 psia with a maximum operating
   193	limit of 4,875 psia at 200 F.
   194	
   195	A pressure sensor downstream of each helium tank in each pod monitors
   196	the helium source pressure and transmits it to the N 2 , He , kit He
   197	switch on panel F7.  When the switch is in the He position, the helium
   198	pressure of the left and right OMS is displayed on the OMS press left,
   199	right meters.  This pressure also is transmitted to the CRT and
   200	displayed.
   201	
   202	The two helium pressure isolation valves in each pod permit helium
   203	source pressure to the propellant tanks or isolate the helium from the
   204	propellant tanks.  The parallel paths in each pod assure helium flow
   205	to the propellant tanks of that pod.  The helium valves are
   206	continuous-duty, solenoid-operated.  They are energized open and
   207	spring loaded closed.  The OMS He press/vapor isol switches on panel
   208	O8 permit automatic or manual control of the valves.  With the
   209	switches in the GPC position, the valves are automatically controlled
   210	by the general-purpose computer during an engine thrusting sequence.
   211	The valves are controlled manually by placing the switches to open or
   212	close.
   213	
   214	The pressure regulators reduce the helium source pressure to the
   215	desired working pressure.  Pressure is regulated by assemblies
   216	downstream of each helium pressure isolation valve.  Each assembly
   217	contains primary and secondary regulators in series and a flow
   218	limiter.  Normally, the primary regulator is the controlling
   219	regulator.  The secondary regulator is normally open during a dynamic
   220	flow condition.  It will not become the controlling regulator until
   221	the primary regulator allows a higher pressure than normal.  All
   222	regulator assemblies are in reference to a bellows assembly that is
   223	vented to ambient.  The primary regulator outlet pressure at normal
   224	flow is 252 to 262 psig and 247 psig minimum at high abort flow, with
   225	lockup at 266 psig maximum.  The secondary regulator outlet pressure
   226	at normal flow is 259 to 269 psig and 254 psig minimum at high abort
   227	flow, with lockup at 273 psig maximum.  The flow limiter restricts the
   228	flow to a maximum of 1,040 stan dard cubic feet per minute and to a
   229	minimum of 304 standard cubic feet per minute.
   230	
   231	The vapor isolation valves in the oxidizer pressurization line to the
   232	oxidizer tank prevent oxidizer vapor from migrating upstream and over
   233	into the fuel system.  These are low-pressure, two-position, two-way,
   234	solenoid-operated valves that are energized open and spring loaded
   235	closed.  They can be commanded manually or automatically by the
   236	positioning of the He press/vapor isol switches on panel O8.  When
   237	either of the A or B switches is in the open position, both vapor
   238	isolation valves are energized open; and when both switches are in the
   239	close position, both vapor isolation valves are closed.  When the
   240	switches are in the GPC position, the GPC opens and closes the valves
   241	automatically.
   242	
   243	The check valve assembly in each parallel path contains four
   244	independent check valves connected in a series-parallel configuration
   245	to provide a positive checking action against a reverse flow of
   246	propellant liquid or vapor, and the parallel path permits redundant
   247	paths of helium to be directed to the propellant tanks.  Filters are
   248	incorporated into the inlet of each check valve assembly.
   249	
   250	Two pressure sensors in the helium pressurization line upstream of the
   251	fuel and oxidizer tanks monitor the regulated tank pressure and
   252	transmit it to the RCS/OMS press rotary switch on panel O3.  When the
   253	switch is in the OMS prplnt position, the left and right fuel and
   254	oxidizer pressure is displayed.  If the tank pressure is lower than
   255	234 psia or above 284 psia, the left or right OMS red caution and
   256	warning light on panel F7 will be illuminated.  These pressures also
   257	are transmitted to the CRT and displayed.
   258	
   259	The relief valves in each pressurization path limit excessive pressure
   260	in the propellant tanks.  Each pressure relief valve also contains a
   261	burst diaphragm and filter.  If excessive pressure is caused by helium
   262	or propellant vapor, the diaphragm will rupture and the relief valve
   263	will open and vent the excessive pressure overboard.  The filter
   264	prevents particulates from the non-fragmentation-type diaphragm from
   265	entering the relief valve seat.  The relief valve will close and reset
   266	after the pressure has returned to the operating level.  The burst
   267	diaphragm is used to provide a more positive seal of helium and
   268	propellant vapors than the relief valve.  The diaphragm ruptures
   269	between 303 and 313 psig.  The relief valve opens at a minimum of 286
   270	psig and a maximum of 313 psig.  The relief valve's minimum reseat
   271	pressure is 280 psig.  The maximum flow capacity of the relief valve
   272	at 60 F and 313 psig is 520 cubic feet per minute.

   276	
   277	PROPELLANT STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION.
   278	
   279	The propellant storage and distribution system consists of one fuel
   280	tank and one oxidizer tank in each pod.  It also contains propellant
   281	feed lines, interconnect lines, isolation valves and crossfeed valves.
   282	
   283	The OMS propellant tanks of both pods enable the orbiter to reach a
   284	1,000-foot- per-second velocity change with a 65,000-pound payload in
   285	the payload bay.  An OMS pod crossfeed line allows the propellants in
   286	the pods to be used to operate either OMS engine.
   287	
   288	The propellant is contained in domed cylindrical titanium tanks within
   289	each pod.  Each propellant tank is 96.38 inches long with a diameter
   290	of 49.1 inches and a volume of 89.89 cubic feet unpressurized.  The
   291	dry weight of each tank is 250 pounds.  The propellant tanks are
   292	pressurized by the helium system.
   293	
   294	Each tank contains a propellant acquisition and retention assembly in
   295	the aft end and is divided into forward and aft compartments.  The
   296	propellant acquisition and retention assembly is located in the aft
   297	compartment and consists of an intermediate bulkhead with
   298	communication screen and an acquisition system.  The propellant in the
   299	tank is directed from the forward compartment through the intermediate
   300	bulkhead through the communication screen into the aft compartment
   301	during OMS velocity maneuvers.  The communication screen retains
   302	propellant in the aft compartment during zero-gravity conditions.
   303	
   304	The acquisition assembly consists of four stub galleries and a
   305	collector manifold.  The stub galleries acquire wall-bound propellant
   306	at OMS start and during RCS velocity maneuvers to prevent gas
   307	ingestion.  The stub galleries have screens that allow propellant flow
   308	and prevent gas ingestion.  The collector manifold is connected to the
   309	stub galleries and also contains a gas arrestor screen to further
   310	prevent gas ingestion, which permits OMS engine ignition without the
   311	need of a propellant-settling maneuver employing RCS thrusters.  The
   312	propellant tank's nominal operating pressure is 250 psi, with a
   313	maximum operating pressure limit of 313 psia.
   314	
   315	A capacitance gauging system in each OMS propellant tank measures the
   316	propellant in the tank.  The system consists of a forward and aft
   317	probe and a totalizer.  The forward and aft fuel probes use fuel
   318	(which is a conductor) as one plate of the capacitor and a glass tube
   319	that is metallized on the inside as the other.  The forward and aft
   320	oxidizer probes use two concentric nickel tubes as the capacitor
   321	plates and oxidizer as the dielectric.  (Helium is also a dielectric,
   322	but has a different dielectric constant than the oxidizer.) The aft
   323	probes in each tank contain a resistive temperature-sensing element to
   324	correct variations in fluid density.  The fluid in the area of the
   325	communication screens cannot be measured.
   326	
   327	The totalizer receives OMS valve operation information and inputs from
   328	the forward and aft probes in each tank and outputs total and aft
   329	quantities and a low level quantity.  The inputs from the OMS valves
   330	allow control logic in the totalizer to determine when an OMS engine
   331	is thrusting and which tanks are being used.  The totalizer begins an
   332	engine flow rate/time integration process at the start of the OMS
   333	thrusting period, which reduces the indicated amount of propellants by
   334	a preset estimated rate for the first 14.8 seconds.  After 14.8
   335	seconds of OMS thrusting, which settles the propellant surface, the
   336	probe capacitance gauging system outputs are enabled, which permits
   337	the quantity of propellant remaining to be displayed.  The totalizer
   338	outputs are displayed on the OMS/RCS prplnt qty meters on panel O3
   339	when the rotary switch is positioned to the OMS fuel or oxid
   340	positions.
   341	
   342	When the wet or dry analog comparator indicates the forward probe is
   343	dry, the ungaugeable propellant in the region of the intermediate
   344	bulkhead is added to the aft probe output quantity, decreasing the
   345	total quantity at a preset rate for 98.15 seconds, and updates from
   346	the aft probes are inhibited.  After 98.15 seconds of thrusting, the
   347	aft probe output inhibit is removed, and the aft probe updates the
   348	total quantity.  When the quantity decreases to 5 percent, the
   349	low-level signal is output.
   350	
   351	Parallel tank isolation valves in each pod located between the
   352	propellant tanks and the OMS engine and the OMS crossfeed valves
   353	permit propellant to be supplied to the OMS engine and OMS crossfeed
   354	valves or isolate the propellant.  The left or right OMS tank
   355	isolation A switch on panel O8 controls the A fuel and A oxidizer
   356	valve in that pod, and the B switch controls the B fuel and B oxidizer
   357	valve in that pod.  When the left or right tank isolation switches in
   358	a pod are positioned to GPC , pairs of valves are automatically opened
   359	or closed upon command from the orbiter computer.  When a pair of
   360	valves is opened, fuel and oxidizer from the corresponding propellant
   361	tanks are allowed to flow to that OMS engine and OMS crossfeed valves;
   362	and when that pair of valves is closed, fuel and oxidizer are isolated
   363	from the OMS engine and OMS crossfeed valves.  The switch positions
   364	open, GPC and close are permanent-position switches.  Electrical power
   365	is provided to an electrical motor controller assembly, which supplies
   366	power to the ac-motor-operated valve actuators.  Once the valve is in
   367	the commanded position, logic in the motor controller assembly removes
   368	power from the ac-motor-operated valve actuator.  A talkback indicator
   369	above each tank isolation switch on panel O8 indicates the status of
   370	the fuel valve and oxidizer valve.  The talkback indicator is
   371	controlled by microswitches in each pair of valves.  The talkback
   372	indicator indicates op when that pair of valves is open, barberpole
   373	when the valves are in transit or one valve is open or closed, and cl
   374	when that pair of valves is closed.  The open and close positions of
   375	each left or right tank isolation A, B switch permits manual control
   376	of the corresponding pair of valves (one for fuel and one for
   377	oxidizer).
   378	
   379	In each pod, parallel left or right OMS crossfeed valves are
   380	controlled by the left, right crossfeed A, B switches on panel O8.
   381	The A switch controls the A fuel and A oxidizer ac-motor-operated
   382	valve actuators in the pod selected, and the B switch controls the B
   383	fuel and B oxidizer valve in the pod selected.  When the A or B switch
   384	in a pod is positioned to GPC , the A or B pair of fuel and oxidizer
   385	valves is automatically opened or closed upon command from the orbiter
   386	computer.  For example, when the A or B pair of crossfeed valves in
   387	the left pod is opened, fuel and oxidizer from the left pod are routed
   388	to the OMS crossfeed valves of the right pod; thus, a pair of A or B
   389	crossfeed valves in the right pod must be opened to permit the left
   390	pod fuel and oxidizer to be directed to the right OMS pod engine.  A
   391	talkback indicator above the pod crossfeed switches on panel O8
   392	indicates the status of the selected pair's fuel and oxidizer valves.
   393	The talkback indicator indicates op when both valves are open,
   394	barberpole when the valves are in transit or one valve is open and one
   395	closed, and cl when both valves are closed.  The left, right crossfeed
   396	A, B open/close switches on panel O8 permit manual control of the
   397	corresponding pair of fuel and oxidizer valves.
   398	
   399	The left and right OMS crossfeed A, B switches also provide the
   400	capability to supply OMS propellants to the left and right aft RCS
   401	engines.  The left and right aft RCS will not be used to supply
   402	propellants to the OMS due to differences in pressures between the OMS
   403	and RCS.
   404	
   405	The OMS crossfeed fuel and oxidizer line pressures are monitored on
   406	telemetry and are transmitted to the flight deck CRT.
   407	
   408	There are 64 ac -motor-operated valve actuators in the OMS/RCS
   409	nitrogen tetroxide and monomethyl hydrazine propellant systems.  Each
   410	valve actuator was modified to incorporate a 0.25-inch-diameter
   411	stainless steel sniff line from the actuator to the mold line of the
   412	orbiter.  The sniff line permits the monitoring of nitrogen tetroxide
   413	or monomethyl hydrazine in the electrical portion of each valve
   414	actuator during ground operations.
   415	
   416	There are sniff lines in the 12 ac -motor-operated valve actuators in
   417	the forward RCS and in the 44 actua tors in the aft left and aft right
   418	RCS.  The remaining 0.25-inch-diameter sniff lines are in the eight
   419	OMS tank isolation and crossfeed ac-motor-operated valve actuators in
   420	the left and right orbital maneuvering systems.  The 44 aft left and
   421	right RCS sniff lines and the eight OMS left and right sniff lines are
   422	routed to the respective left and right OMS/RCS pod Y web access
   423	servicing panels.
   424	
   425	During ground operations, an interscan can be connected to the sniff
   426	ports to check for the presence of nitrogen tetroxide or monomethyl
   427	hydrazine in the electrical portion of the ac-motor-operated valve
   428	actuators.
   429	
   430	An electrical microswitch in each of the ac-motor-operated valve
   431	actuators signals the respective valves' position (open or closed) to
   432	the onboard flight crew displays and controls as well as telemetry.
   433	An extensive improvement program was implemented to reduce the
   434	probability of floating particulates in the electrical microswitch
   435	portion of each ac-motor-operated valve actuator.  Particulates could
   436	affect the operation of the microswitch in each valve and, thus, the
   437	position indication of the valves to the onboard displays and controls
   438	and telemetry.

   443	ENGINE BIPROPELLANT VALVE ASSEMBLY.
   444	
   445	Each OMS engine receives pressure-fed propellants at its bipropellant
   446	valve assembly.  The bipropellant ball valve assembly is controlled by
   447	its gaseous nitrogen system.  The nitrogen system consists of a
   448	storage tank, engine pressure isolation valve, regulator, relief
   449	valve, check valve, accumulator, engine purge valves, bipropellant
   450	solenoid control valves and actuators that control the bipropellant
   451	ball valves.
   452	
   453	A gaseous nitrogen spherical storage tank is mounted next to the
   454	combustion chamber to supply pressure to its engine pressure isolation
   455	valve.  The tank contains enough nitrogen to operate the ball valves
   456	and purge the engine 10 times.  Nominal tank capacity is 60 cubic
   457	inches.  The maximum tank operating pressure is 3,000 psi, with a
   458	proof pressure of 6,000 psig.
   459	
   460	Each tank's pressure is monitored by two pressure sensors.  One sensor
   461	transmits the tank pressure to the N 2 , He, kit He switch on panel
   462	F7.  When the switch is positioned to N 2 , tank pressure is displayed
   463	on the OMS press N 2 tank left, right meters on panel F7.  The other
   464	sensor transmits pressure to telemetry.
   465	
   466	A dual-coil, solenoid-operated engine pressure isolation valve is
   467	located in each gaseous nitrogen system.  The valve is energized open
   468	and spring-loaded closed.  The engine pressure isolation valve permits
   469	gaseous nitrogen flow from the tank to the regulator, accumulator, the
   470	bipropellant ball valve control valves and purge valves 1 and 2 when
   471	energized open and isolates the nitrogen tank from the gaseous
   472	nitrogen supply system when closed.  The engine pressure isolation
   473	valves in each system are controlled by the OMS eng left, right
   474	switches on panel C3.  When the OMS eng left switch is placed in the
   475	arm press position, the left OMS engine pod's pressure isolation valve
   476	is energized open.  When the OMS eng right switch is placed in the arm
   477	press position, the right OMS engine pod's pressure isolation valve is
   478	energized open.  The gaseous nitrogen engine pressure isolation valve,
   479	when energized open, allows gaseous nitrogen supply pressure to be
   480	directed into a regulator, through a check valve, an in-line
   481	accumulator and to a pair of engine bipropellant control valves.  The
   482	engine bipropellant control valves are controlled by the OMS thrust
   483	on/off commands from the GPCs.
   484	
   485	A single-stage regulator is installed in each gaseous nitrogen
   486	pneumatic control system between the gaseous nitrogen engine pressure
   487	isolation valve and the engine bipropellant control valves.  The
   488	regulator reduces the gaseous nitrogen service pressure to a desired
   489	working pressure of 315 to 360 psig.
   490	
   491	A pressure relief valve downstream of the gaseous nitrogen regulator
   492	limits the pressure to the engine bipropellant control valves and
   493	actuators if a gaseous nitrogen regulator malfunctions.  The relief
   494	valve relieves between 450 and 500 psig and resets at 400 psig
   495	minimum.
   496	
   497	A pressure sensor downstream of the regulator monitors the regulated
   498	pressure and transmits it to the CRT display and to telemetry.
   499	
   500	The check valve located downstream of the gaseous nitrogen regulator
   501	will close if gaseous nitrogen pressure is lost on the upstream side
   502	of the check valve and will isolate the remaining gaseous nitrogen
   503	pressure on the downstream side of the check valve.
   504	
   505	The 19-cubic- inch gaseous nitrogen accumulator downstream of the
   506	check valve and upstream of the bipropellant control valves provides
   507	enough pressure to operate the engine bipropellant control valves one
   508	time with the engine pressure isolation valve closed or in the event
   509	of loss of pressure on the upstream side of the check valve.
   510	
   511	Two solenoid-operated, three-way, two-position bipropellant control
   512	valves on each OMS engine control the bipropellant control valve
   513	actuators and bipropellant ball valves.  Control valve 1 controls the
   514	No.  1 actuator and the fuel and oxidizer ball valves.  Control valve
   515	2 controls the No.  2 actuator and two ball valves, one fuel and
   516	oxidizer ball valve in series to the No.  1 system.  Each control
   517	valve contains two solenoid coils, either of which, when energized,
   518	opens the control valve.
   519	
   520	The right OMS engine gaseous nitrogen solenoid control valves 1 and 2
   521	are energized open by computer commands if the right OMS eng switch on
   522	panel C3 is in the arm or arm/press position and the right OMS eng vlv
   523	switch on panel O16 is on; the valves are de-energized normally when
   524	thrust off is commanded or if the right OMS eng switch is positioned
   525	to off .  The left OMS engine gaseous nitrogen solenoid control valves
   526	1 and 2 are controlled in the same manner, but through the left OMS
   527	eng switch on panel C3 and the left OMS eng vlv switch on panel O14.
   528	
   529	When the gaseous nitrogen solenoid control valves are energized open,
   530	pressure is directed into the two actuators in each engine.  The
   531	nitrogen acts against the piston in each actuator, overcoming the
   532	spring force on the opposite side of the actuators.  Each actuator has
   533	a rack-and-pinion gear; and the linear motion of the actuator
   534	connecting arm is converted into rotary motion, which drives two ball
   535	valves, one fuel and one oxidizer, to the open position.  Each pair of
   536	ball valves opens simultaneously.  Fuel and oxidizer are then directed
   537	to the combustion chamber of the engine, where the propellants atomize
   538	and ignite upon contact.  The hypergolic propellants produce a hot
   539	gas, thus thrust.
   540	
   541	The chamber pressure of each engine is monitored by a pressure sensor
   542	and is transmitted to the OMS press left and right Pc (chamber
   543	pressure) meter on panel F7.
   544	
   545	When the computer commands thrust off or an engine's OMS eng switch on
   546	panel C3 or eng vlv switch on panel O14/O16 is positioned off, the
   547	solenoid control valves are de-energized, removing gaseous nitrogen
   548	pressure from the actuators; and the gaseous nitrogen pressure in the
   549	actuators is vented overboard through the solenoid control valve.  The
   550	spring in the actuator forces the actuator's piston to move in the
   551	opposite direction, and the actuator drives the fuel and oxidizer ball
   552	valves closed simultaneously.  The series-redundant arrangement of
   553	ball valves ensures engine thrusting is terminated.
   554	
   555	Each actuator incorporates a linear position transducer, which
   556	supplies ball valve position to a CRT.
   557	
   558	Check valves are installed in the vent port outlet of each gaseous
   559	nitrogen solenoid control valve on the spring pressure side of each
   560	actuator to protect the seal of these components from atmospheric
   561	contamination.
   562	
   563	Each engine has two gaseous nitrogen purge valves in series.  These
   564	valves are solenoid-operated open and spring-loaded closed.  They are
   565	normally energized open after each thrusting period by the GPCs unless
   566	inhibited by a crew entry on the maneuver CRT display.  The two purge
   567	valves of an engine are energized open 0.36 second after OMS engine
   568	thrust off has been commanded and permit gaseous nitrogen to flow
   569	through the valves and check valve into the fuel line downstream of
   570	the ball valves and out through the combustion chamber and engine
   571	injector to space for two seconds.  This purges the residual fuel from
   572	the combustion chamber and injector of the engine, permitting safe
   573	engine restart.  The purge valves are then de-energized and
   574	spring-loaded closed.  When the purge is completed, the gaseous
   575	nitrogen tank pressure isolation valve is closed by placing the
   576	respective OMS eng switch (panel C3) to off.  The check valve
   577	downstream of the purge valves prevents fuel from flowing to the
   578	engine purge valves during engine thrusting.

   583	ENGINE THRUST CHAMBER ASSEMBLY.
   584	
   585	When the fuel reaches the thrust chamber, it is directed through 102
   586	coolant channels in the combustion chamber wall, providing
   587	regenerative cooling to the combustion chamber walls, and then to the
   588	injector of the engine.  The oxidizer is routed directly to the
   589	injector.  The platelet injector assembly consists of a stack of
   590	plates, each with an etched pattern that provides proper distribution
   591	and propellant injection velocity vector.  The stack is
   592	diffusion-bonded and welded to the body of the injector.  The fuel and
   593	oxidizer orifices are positioned so that the propellants will impinge
   594	and atomize, causing the fuel and oxidizer to ignite because of
   595	hypergolic reaction.
   596	
   597	The contoured nozzle extension is bolted to the aft flange of the
   598	combustion chamber.  The nozzle extension is made of a columbium alloy
   599	and is radiantly cooled.
   600	
   601	The nominal flow rate of oxidizer and fuel to each engine is 11.93
   602	pounds per second and 7.23 pounds per second, respectively, producing
   603	6,000 pounds of thrust at a vacuum specific impulse of 313 seconds.

   608	OMS THRUSTING SEQUENCE.
   609	
   610	The OMS thrusting sequence commands the OMS engines on or off and
   611	commands the engine purge function.  The flight crew can select, via
   612	item entry on the maneuver display, a one- or two-engine thrusting
   613	maneuver and can inhibit the OMS engine purge.
   614	
   615	The sequence determines which engines are selected and then provides
   616	the necessary computer commands to open the appropriate helium vapor
   617	isolation valves and the engine gaseous nitrogen solenoid control
   618	valves and sets an engine-on indicator.  The sequence will monitor the
   619	OMS engine fail flags and, if one or both engines have failed, issue
   620	the appropriate OMS cutoff commands as soon as the crew has confirmed
   621	the failure by placing the OMS eng switch in the off position.  This
   622	will then terminate the appropriate engine's control valve commands.
   623	
   624	In a normal OMS thrusting period, when the OMS cutoff flag is true,
   625	the sequence terminates commands to the helium pressurization, helium
   626	vapor isolation valves and two gaseous nitrogen engine control valves.
   627	If the engine purge sequence is not inhibited, the sequence will check
   628	for the left and right engine arm press signals and after 0.36 second
   629	open the engine gaseous nitrogen purge valves for two seconds for the
   630	engines that have the arm press signals present.

   635	ENGINE THRUST VECTOR CONTROL SYSTEM.
   636	
   637	The engine TVC system consists of a gimbal ring assembly, two gimbal
   638	actuator assemblies and two gimbal actuator controllers.  The engine
   639	gimbal ring assembly and gimbal actuator assemblies provide OMS TVC by
   640	gimbaling the engines in pitch and yaw.  Each engine has a pitch
   641	actuator and a yaw actuator.  Each actuator is extended or retracted
   642	by one of a pair of dual-redundant electric motors and is actuated by
   643	general-purpose computer control signals.
   644	
   645	The gimbal ring assembly contains two mounting pads to attach the
   646	engine to the gimbal ring and two pads to attach the gimbal ring to
   647	the orbiter.  The ring transmits engine thrust to the pod and orbiter.
   648	
   649	The pitch and yaw gimbal actuator assembly for each OMS engine
   650	provides the force to gimbal the engines.  Each actuator contains a
   651	primary and secondary motor and drive gears.  The primary and
   652	secondary drive systems are isolated and are not operated
   653	concurrently.  Each actuator consists of two redundant brushless dc
   654	motors and gear trains, a single jackscrew and nut-tube assembly and
   655	redundant linear position feedback transducers.  A GPC position
   656	command signal from the primary electronic controller energizes the
   657	primary dc motor, which is coupled with a reduction gear and a no-back
   658	device.  The output from the primary power train drives the jackscrew
   659	of the drive assembly, causing the nut-tube to translate (with the
   660	secondary power train at idle), which causes angular engine movement.
   661	If the primary power train is inoperative, a GPC position command from
   662	the secondary electronic controller energizes the secondary dc motor,
   663	providing linear travel by applying torque to the nut-tube through the
   664	spline that extends along the nut-tube for the stroke length of the
   665	unit.  Rotation of the nut-tube about the stationary jackscrew causes
   666	the nut-tube to move along the screw.  A no-back device in each drive
   667	system prevents backdriving of the standby system.
   668	
   669	The electrical interface, power and electronic control elements for
   670	active and standby control channels are assembled in separate
   671	enclosures designated the active actuator controller and standby
   672	actuator controller.  These are mounted on the OMS/RCS pod structure.
   673	The active and standby actuator controllers are electrically and
   674	mechanically interchangeable.
   675	
   676	The gimbal assembly provides control angles of plus or minus 6 degrees
   677	in pitch and plus or minus 7 degrees in yaw with clearance provided
   678	for an additional 1 degree for snubbing and tolerances.  The engine
   679	null position is with the engine nozzles up 15 degrees 49 seconds (as
   680	projected in the orbiter XZ plane) and outboard 6 degrees 30 seconds
   681	(measured in the 15-degree 49-second plane).
   682	
   683	The thrust vector control command subsystem operating program
   684	processes and outputs pitch and yaw OMS engine actuator commands and
   685	the actuator power selection discretes.  The OMS TVC command SOP is
   686	active during operational sequences, orbit insertion (OMS-1 and
   687	OMS-2), orbit coast, deorbit, deorbit coast and return-to-launch-site
   688	abort.
   689	
   690	The flight crew can select either the primary or the secondary motors
   691	of the pitch and yaw actuators by item entry on the maneuver display
   692	or can select actuators off.  The actuator command outputs are
   693	selected by the TVC command SOP depending on the flag that is present,
   694	i.e., major modes, deorbit maneuver, orbit coast, and RTLS abort,
   695	center-of-gravity trim and gimbal check.  The deorbit maneuver coast
   696	flag causes the TVC command SOP to output I-loaded values to command
   697	the engines to the entry stowed position.  The presence of the RTLS
   698	abort and center-of-gravity trim flags causes the engines to be
   699	commanded to a predefined position with the thrust vector through the
   700	center of gravity.  The major mode RTLS flag by itself will cause the
   701	engines to be commanded to a stowed position for return-to-launch-site
   702	entry.  The gimbal check flag causes the engines to be commanded to
   703	plus 7 degrees yaw and 6 degrees pitch, then to minus 7 degrees yaw
   704	and 6 degrees pitch, and back to zero degrees yaw and pitch.  In the
   705	absence of these flags, the TVC command SOP will output the digital
   706	autopilot gimbal actuator commands to the engine actuators.  The
   707	backup flight control system allows only manual TVC during a thrusting
   708	period, but it is otherwise similar.
   709	
   710	The OMS TVC feedback SOP monitors the primary and secondary actuator
   711	selection discretes from the maneuver display and performs
   712	compensation on the selected pitch and yaw actuator feedback data.
   713	This data is output to the OMS actuator fault detection and
   714	identification and to the maneuver display.  The OMS TVC feedback SOP
   715	is active during orbit insertion (OMS-1 and OMS-2), orbit coast,
   716	deorbit maneuver and deorbit maneuver coast.  The present OMS gimbal
   717	positions can be monitored on the maneuver CRT display when this SOP
   718	is active and the primary or secondary actuator motors are selected.

   723	THERMAL CONTROL.
   724	
   725	OMS thermal control is achieved by insulation on the interior surface
   726	of the pods that enclose the OMS hardware components and the use of
   727	strip heaters.  Wrap around heaters and insulation condition the
   728	crossfeed lines.  The heaters prevent propellant from freezing in the
   729	tanks and lines.  The heater system is divided into two areas: the
   730	OMS/RCS pods and the aft fuselage crossfeed and bleed lines.  Each
   731	heater system has two redundant heater systems, A and B, and is
   732	controlled by the RCS/OMS heaters switches on panel A14.
   733	
   734	Each OMS/RCS pod is divided into eight heater areas.  Each of the
   735	heater areas in the pods contains an A and B element, and each element
   736	has a thermostat that controls the temperature from 55 to 75 F.  These
   737	heater elements are controlled by the left pod and right pod switches
   738	on panel A14.  Sensors located throughout the pods supply temperature
   739	information to the propellant thermal CRT display and telemetry.
   740	
   741	The crossfeed line thermal control in the aft fuselage is divided into
   742	11 heater areas.  Each area is heated in parallel by heater systems A
   743	and B, and each area has a control thermostat to maintain temperature
   744	at 55 F minimum to 75 F maximum.  Each circuit also has an
   745	overtemperature thermostat to protect against a failed-on heater
   746	switch.  These heater elements are controlled by the respective crsfd
   747	lines switch on panel A14.  Temperature sensors near the control
   748	thermostats on the crossfeed and bleed lines supply temperature
   749	information on the propellant thermal CRT display and telemetry.

   754	OMS-RCS INTERCONNECT.
   755	
   756	An interconnect between the OMS crossfeed line and the aft RCS
   757	manifolds provides the capability to operate the aft RCS using 1,000
   758	pounds per pod of OMS propellant for orbital maneuvers.  The aft RCS
   759	may use OMS propellant from either OMS pod in orbit.
   760	
   761	The orbital interconnect sequence is available during orbit operations
   762	and on-orbit checkout.
   763	
   764	The flight crew must first configure the following switches (using a
   765	feed from the left OMS as an example): (1) posi tion the aft left RCS
   766	tank isolation 1/2, 3/4/5A and 3/4/5B and aft right RCS tank isolation
   767	1/2, 3/4/5A and 3/4/5B switches on panel O7 to close; (2) check that
   768	the talkback indicator above these switches indicates cl, and position
   769	the aft left RCS crossfeed 1/2, 3/4/5 and aft right RCS crossfeed 1/2,
   770	3/4/5 switches to open; (3) check that the indicators show op and open
   771	the left OMS tank isolation A and B valves (panel O8) and verify the
   772	talkback indicators show op ; (4) open the left OMS crossfeed A and B
   773	valves and verify the indicators show op ; (5) close the right OMS
   774	crossfeed A and B valves and verify the indicators show cl; and (6)
   775	position the left OMS He press/vapor isol valve A switch in the GPC
   776	position.  The left OMS-to-aft-RCS interconnect sequence can then be
   777	initiated by item entry on the RCS SPEC display.
   778	
   779	The left OMS helium pressure vapor isolation valve A will be commanded
   780	open when the left OMS tank (ullage) pressure decays to 236 psig, and
   781	the open commands will be terminated 30 seconds later.  If the left
   782	OMS tank (ullage) pressure remains below 236 psia, the sequence will
   783	set an OMS/RCS valve miscompare flag and will set a Class 3 alarm and
   784	a CRT fault message.  The sequence also will enable the OMS-to-RCS
   785	gauging sequence at the same time.
   786	
   787	The flight crew can terminate the sequence and inhibit the OMS-to-RCS
   788	gauging sequence by use of the OMS press ena-off item entry on the RCS
   789	SPEC display.  The valves can then be reconfigured to their normal
   790	position on panels O7 and O8.  The OMS-to-aft-RCS interconnect
   791	sequence is not available in the backup flight control system.

   796	OMS-TO-RCS GAUGING SEQUENCE.
   797	
   798	The OMS-to-aft-RCS propellant quantities are calculated by burn time
   799	integration.  Once each cycle, the accumulated aft RCS thruster cycles
   800	are used to compute the OMS propellant used since the initiation of
   801	gauging.  The number of RCS thruster cycles is provided by the RCS
   802	command subsystem operating program to account for minimum-impulse
   803	firing of the RCS thrusters.  The gauging sequence is initiated by
   804	item entry of the OMS right or OMS left interconnect on the RCS SPEC
   805	CRT display and is terminated by the return to normal item entry.
   806	
   807	The gauging sequence maintains a cumulative total of left and right
   808	OMS propellant used during OMS-to-aft-RCS interconnects and displays
   809	the cumulative totals as percentage of left and right OMS propellant
   810	on the RCS SPEC display.  The flight crew will be alerted by a Class 3
   811	alarm and a fault message when the total quantity used from either OMS
   812	pod exceeds 1,000 pounds or 8.37 percent.

   817	ABORT CONTROL SEQUENCES.
   818	
   819	The abort control sequence is the software that manages, among other
   820	items, the OMS and aft RCS configuration and thrusting periods during
   821	ascent aborts to improve performance or to consume OMS and aft RCS
   822	propellants for orbiter center-of-gravity control.
   823	
   824	Premission-determined parameters are provided for the OMS and aft RCS
   825	thrusting periods during aborts since the propellant loading and
   826	orbiter center of gravity vary with each mission.
   827	
   828	The premission-determined parameters for the abort-to-orbit thrusting
   829	period are modified during flight, based on the vehicle velocity at
   830	abort initiation.  The premission-determined parameters for abort once
   831	around are grouped with different values for early or late AOA.  The
   832	return-to-launch-site parameters are contained in a single table.
   833	
   834	The abort control sequence is available in OPS 1 and 6 and is
   835	initiated at SRB separation if selected before then or at the time of
   836	selection if after SRB separation.
   837	
   838	ATO and AOA Aborts.  The OMS and aft RCS begin thrusting as soon as an
   839	ATO or AOA is initiated with one main engine out.
   840	
   841	For some aborts, an OMS-to-aft-RCS interconnect is not desired.  A
   842	parallel aft RCS plus X thrusting period using aft RCS propellant and
   843	the four aft RCS plus X thrusters will be performed during the OMS-1
   844	thrusting period to achieve the desired orbit.  If a plus X aft RCS
   845	thrusting period is required before main engine cutoff, the abort
   846	control sequence will command the four aft plus X RCS jets on if
   847	vehicle acceleration is greater than 0.8 g and will monitor the RCS
   848	cutoff time to terminate the thrusting period.  If an RCS propellant
   849	dump (burn) is required before MECO and vehicle acceleration is
   850	greater than 1.8 g, the abort control sequence will command an
   851	eight-aft-RCS-jet null thrust and monitor the RCS cutoff time to
   852	terminate the thrusting period.
   853	
   854	In other abort cases, an OMS-to-aft-RCS interconnect is desired.  This
   855	thrusting is performed with the OMS and four aft RCS plus X thrusters
   856	to consume OMS propellant for orbiter center-of-gravity control.  More
   857	aft RCS jets can be commanded if needed to increase OMS propellant
   858	usage.  For example, for an OMS propellant dump (burn), 14 aft RCS
   859	null jets can be commanded to thrust to improve orbiter
   860	center-of-gravity location.
   861	
   862	If the amount of OMS propellant used before MECO leaves less than 28
   863	percent of OMS propellants, a 15-second aft RCS ullage thrust is
   864	performed after MECO to provide a positive OMS propellant feed to
   865	start the OMS-1 thrusting period.
   866	
   867	The OMS-to-aft-RCS interconnect sequence provides for an automatic
   868	interconnect of the OMS propellant to the aft RCS when required and
   869	reconfigures the propellant feed from the OMS and aft RCS tanks to
   870	their normal state after the thrusting periods have ended.  The
   871	interconnect sequence is initiated by the abort control sequence.
   872	
   873	In order to establish a known configuration of the valves, the
   874	interconnect sequence terminates the GPC commands to the following
   875	valves if they have not been terminated before honoring a request from
   876	the abort control sequence: left and right OMS crossfeed A and B
   877	valves, aft RCS crossfeed valves and aft RCS tank isolation valves.
   878	
   879	A request from the abort control sequence for an OMS-to-aft-RCS
   880	interconnect will sequentially configure the OMS/RCS valves as
   881	follows: close the left and right aft RCS propellant tank isolation
   882	valves, open the left and right OMS crossfeed A and B valves, and open
   883	the left and right aft RCS crossfeed valves.  The OMS-to-aft-RCS
   884	interconnect complete flag is then set to true.
   885	
   886	When the abort control sequence requests a return to normal
   887	configuration, all affected OMS/RCS propellant valve commands are
   888	removed to establish a known condition; and the interconnect sequence
   889	will then sequentially configure the valves as follows: close aft RCS
   890	crossfeed valves, close left and right OMS crossfeed valves and open
   891	aft RCS propellant tank isolation valves.  The OMS-to-aft-RCS
   892	reconfiguration complete flag is then set to false, and the sequence
   893	is terminated.
   894	
   895	Return-to-Launch-Site Abort.  An RTLS abort requires the dumping of
   896	OMS propellant by burning the OMS propellant through both OMS engines
   897	and through the 24 aft RCS thrusters to improve abort performance and
   898	to achieve an acceptable entry orbiter vehicle weight and
   899	center-of-gravity location.  The thrusting period is
   900	premission-determined and depends on the OMS propellant load.
   901	
   902	The OMS engines start the thrusting sequence; and after the
   903	OMS-to-aft-RCS interconnect is complete, the aft RCS thrusters are
   904	commanded on.  The OMS engines and RCS thrusters then continue their
   905	burn for a predetermined period.  The interconnect sequence is the
   906	same for ATO and AOA aborts.  The OMS and aft RCS will begin thrusting
   907	at SRB staging if the abort is initiated during the first stage of
   908	flight or immediately upon abort initiation during second stage.
   909	
   910	Contingency Abort.  A contingency abort is selected automatically at
   911	the loss of a second main engine or manually by the flight crew using
   912	an item entry on the RTLS TRAJ or RTLS TRANS CRT displays.  For the
   913	contingency aborts, the OMS-to-aft-RCS interconnect is performed in a
   914	modified manner to allow continuous flow of propellants to the aft RCS
   915	jets for vehicle control and to allow contingency rapid dump (burning)
   916	of OMS and RCS propellants.  The abort control sequence tracks the
   917	total time the OMS and aft RCS are on to determine the amount of
   918	propellants used.
   919	
   920	The request for an interconnect will cause the interconnect sequence
   921	to configure the valves sequentially as follows: open the aft RCS
   922	crossfeed valves, open the left OMS crossfeed valves A, open the right
   923	OMS crossfeed valves B, close the left and right aft RCS tank
   924	isolation valves, open the left OMS crossfeed valves B and open the
   925	right OMS crossfeed valves A.  The OMS-to-aft-RCS interconnect
   926	complete flag will then be set to true.
   927	
   928	If the rapid dump is selected before MECO, the OMS-to-aft-RCS
   929	interconnect occurs, and both OMS engines and the 24 aft RCS jets are
   930	commanded to thrust until the desired amount of propellant has been
   931	consumed.  The rapid dump will be interrupted during external tank
   932	separation if the thrusting period is not completed before MECO;
   933	otherwise, the thrusting period terminates when thrusting time equals
   934	zero or if the normal acceleration exceeds a threshold value.
   935	
   936	Upon completion of the thrusting period, the OMS-to-aft-RCS
   937	configuration flag will be set to false, and the sequence will be
   938	terminated.  A return-to-normal-configuration request by the abort
   939	control sequence will cause the interconnect sequence to configure the
   940	valves sequentially as follows: open aft RCS propellant tank isolation
   941	valves, close the aft RCS crossfeed valves, and close the left and
   942	right OMS crossfeed A and B valves.  The OMS-to-aft-RCS interconnect
   943	complete flag will be set to false, and the sequence will be
   944	terminated.

   949	OMS ENGINE FAULT DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION.
   950	
   951	The OMS engine FDI function detects and identifies off-nominal
   952	performance of the OMS engine, such as off-failures during OMS
   953	thrusting periods, on-failures after or before a thrusting period and
   954	high or low engine chamber pressures.
   955	
   956	Redundancy management software performs OMS engine FDI.  It is assumed
   957	that the flight crew arms only the OMS engine to be used; the OMS
   958	engine not armed cannot be used for thrusting.  FDI will be
   959	initialized at SRB ignition and terminated after the OMS-1 thrusting
   960	period or, in the case of an RTLS abort, at the transition from RTLS
   961	entry to the RTLS landing sequence program.  The FDI also will be
   962	initiated before each OMS burn and will be terminated after the OMS
   963	thrusting period is complete.
   964	
   965	The OMS engine FDI uses both a velocity comparison and a chamber
   966	pressure comparison method to determine a failed-on or failed-off
   967	engine.  The velocity comparison is used only after MECO since the OMS
   968	thrust is small compared to main propulsion thrust before MECO.
   969	
   970	The measured velocity increment is compared to a predetermined
   971	one-engine and two-engine acceleration threshold value by the
   972	redundancy management software to determine the number of engines
   973	actually firing.  This information, along with the assumption that an
   974	armed engine is to be used, allows the software to determine if the
   975	engine has low thrust or has shut down prematurely.
   976	
   977	The chamber pressure comparison test compares a predetermined
   978	threshold chamber pressure level to the measured chamber pressure to
   979	determine a failed engine (on, off or low thrust).
   980	
   981	The engine-on command and the chamber pressure are used before MECO to
   982	determine a failed engine.  The velocity indication and the chamber
   983	pressure indication are used after MECO to determine a failed engine.
   984	If the engine fails the chamber pressure test but passes the velocity
   985	test after MECO, the engine will be considered failed.  Such a failure
   986	would illuminate the red right OMS or left OMS caution and warning
   987	light on panel F7 and the master alarm and produce a fault message.
   988	In addition, if an engine fails the chamber pressure and velocity
   989	tests, a down arrow is displayed on the maneuver CRT next to the
   990	failed engine.
   991	
   992	When the flight crew disarms a failed engine by turning the arm/press
   993	switch on panel C3 to off , a signal is sent to the OMS thrusting
   994	sequence to shut down the engine and to signal guidance to
   995	reconfigure.  Guidance reconfigures and downmodes from two OMS
   996	engines, to one OMS engine, to four plus X RCS jets.

  1001	OMS GIMBAL ACTUATOR FDI.
  1002	
  1003	The OMS gimbal actuator FDI detects and identifies off-nominal
  1004	performance of the pitch and yaw gimbal actuators of the OMS engines.
  1005	
  1006	The OMS gimbal actuator FDI is divided into two processes.  The first
  1007	determines if the actuators should move from their present position.
  1008	If the actuators must move, the second part determines how much they
  1009	should move and whether the desired movement has occurred.
  1010	
  1011	The first part checks the actuators' gimbal deflection error (which is
  1012	the difference between the commanded new position and the actuators'
  1013	last known position) and determines whether the actuators should
  1014	extend or retract or if they are being driven against a stop.  If the
  1015	actuators are in the desired position or being driven against a stop,
  1016	the first part of the process will be repeated.  If the first part
  1017	determines that the actuator should move, the second part of the
  1018	actuator FDI process is performed.
  1019	
  1020	The second part of the actuator FDI process checks the present
  1021	position of each actuator against its last known position to determine
  1022	whether the actuators have moved more than a threshold amount.  If the
  1023	actuators have not moved more than this amount, an actuator failure is
  1024	incremented by one.  Each time an actuator fails this test, the
  1025	failure is again incremented by one.  When the actuator failure
  1026	counter reaches an I-loaded value of four, the actuator is declared
  1027	failed and a fault message is output.  The actuator failure counter is
  1028	reset to zero any time the actuator passes the threshold test.
  1029	
  1030	The first and second parts of the actuator FDI process continue to
  1031	perform in this manner.  The actuator FDI process can detect full-off
  1032	gimbal failures and full-on failures indirectly.  The full-on failure
  1033	determines that the gimbal has extended or retracted too far and
  1034	commands reverse motion.  If no motion occurs, the actuator will be
  1035	declared failed.  The flight crew's response to a failed actuator is
  1036	to select the secondary actuator electronics by item entry on the
  1037	maneuver CRT display.
