    10	                  DISK STORAGE REACHES MOLECULAR LEVEL

    12	Forget disc capacity as we know it: 550 megabytes on a CD-ROM; 108,000
    13	frames on a videodisc; 4 gigabytes on a 14-inch optical disc.  These will
    14	all become insignificant as Martin Marietta's new optical storage system
    15	works at a terabyte per square centimeter capacity, in half the current
    16	access time.

    18	OAK RIDGE, Tennessee -- Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory
    19	(ORNL), have invented a new optical storage technology capable of turning
    20	a single molecule on an optical disc into a storage point.
    21		ORNL, part of the Department of Energy and one of the largest
    22	government research laboratories, is operated by Martin Marietta Energy
    23	Systems.  The department has transferred the rights to Martin Marietta,
    24	which is now in the process of patenting and licensing the technology.
    25	Energy Systems has started to solicit interested companies for possible
    26	licensing agreements.
    27		The most common methods for writing on optical discs use lasers
    28	to burn pits or micron-sized holes or change the polarity of individual
    29	data points in substrate sandwiched between two layers of polycarbonate.
    30	The hardware then "reads" the change in the position of the reflected
    31	laser's beam.  The new system uses a laser or radiation beam similar to
    32	current systems.  But the unique featurea of ORNL's technology is in its
    33	ability to go to the molecular level.
    34		A VIDEO COMPUTING reporter talked with Mr. Guven Yalcintas
    35	(pronounced Yal*sin*tosh), Martin Marietta's licensing director.
    36	
    37	V.C.:  Currently we use lasers to burn pits or blisters into substrate.
    38	What are you doing that is different?
    39	
    40	Mr. Yalcintas:  We will license this technology to one of the companies,
    41	an American company.  We would like to protect the patentable ideas.  Our
    42	discussion will take place within that limit.  In today's technology,
    43	optical disk technology, the lasers are simply burning a hole.  Well, you
    44	can do that in this technology, too.  What is new is we can write to the
    45	media without burning the hole.  We can make changes in the molecular
    46	level.
    47	
    48	V.C.:  Are you referring to changes in the polarity?
    49	
    50	Mr. Yalcintas:  Yes indeed.  You can change the polarity of the molecule
    51	or you can identify that molecule as plus or minus, zeroes or ones
    52	becoming information.
    53	
    54	V.C.:  How do you read back the information?
    55	
    56	Mr. Yalcintas:  Whatever source we use to change that information at the
    57	molecular level is the same source that receives it back.
    58	
    59	V.C.:  We currently use lasers to do that.  Are you using a laser?
    60	
    61	Mr. Yalcintas:  Yes.  In fact, the laser we use has much lower power that
    62	modifies the molecule.
    63	
    64	V.C.:  Is this technology erasable?
    65	
    66	Mr. Yalcintas:  This is WORM technology.  You sensitize the substrate and
    67	place the information covered with the plastic coating and the
    68	information is going to stay there.
    69	
    70	V.C.:  Has anyone talked about the possibility of making it erasable?
    71	
    72	Mr. Yalcintas:  No.  Let me go one step back.  ORNL is a government
    73	laboratory.  It is operated by Martin Marietta for the Department of
    74	Energy. What goes on over here every day with 5,000 plus scientists is
    75	basic research.  The research this group of scientists is working on is
    76	a project to identify a trace amount of organic compounds in order to be
    77	able to develop a sensor, a detecting system for minute amounts of
    78	organic compounds.  We have developed very nice operating radiation
    79	detectors.  While they were working on that research, they figured out
    80	that they could leave information on a substrate with a laser.  The
    81	research was not directed at optical discs to store information as
    82	WORM or erasable.  One day, other research may find some easy way to
    83	deal with that.  Right now it's not the topic.  Right now we are
    84	finding out every day that WORM technology is in great demand.  The
    85	IRS wants WORM technology, the Navy wants WORM technology.  The nuclear
    86	regulatory commission wants to check data on reactors.  It doesn't want
    87	that data to be changed.  For one reason, there is no funding for that,
    88	and second, we don't believe there is any reason to erase.  With this
    89	volume of storage you don't need to erase, you just keep on storing.
    90	
    91	V.C.:  How much data can you store?
    92	
    93	Mr. Yalcintas:  Roughly, the size of the molecule is 10 -6E (0.000001)
    94	centimeters, in one square centimeter you then have 10 12E molecules.
    95	If each molecule is a potential storage spot for the data, then you
    96	have 10 12E bytes in one square centimeter (1,000,000,000,000... one
    97	trillion bytes per centimeter!).  If you pick up a disc with 500 million
    98	storage spots (present day CD-ROM), in the same size storage disc you are
    99	going to have probably 500 million times one million storage spots.
   100	That's why people are really fascinated.
   101	
   102	V.C.:  I take it that the technology is at a fundamental level of
   103	research.  Have you done a "blackbox" yet?
   104	
   105	Mr. Yalcintas:  No, and we are probably not going to.  This office
   106	receives 15 to 20 inventions per month.  We analyze them and try to
   107	license them.  If there is a stumbling block with industry, we can go
   108	out one more step to develop.  We have maturation funding we can use
   109	for further study, but for this project I don't believe it will be
   110	necessary.  When we show the data, people are fascinated.
   111	
   112	V.C.:  Have you licensed the technology yet?
   113	
   114	Mr. Yalcintas:  We have been talking to over 40 companies, 15 of which
   115	requested non-disclosure information.  Four of them have already signed,
   116	and we have released full information to them.
   117	
   118	V.C.:  What are other advantages of your new technology?
   119	
   120	Mr. Yalcintas:  You can specify what part of the information can be
   121	accessed for security purposes.  It can be made secure, so the
   122	military will be delighted.  You can identify an access frequency for
   123	someone and he can't read the rest of the disc.  Also, much more
   124	information can be entered at current optical disc speeds.  The speed
   125	for current optical discs is identified at somewhere near 1800 to 1900
   126	rpm.  I have heard of some to 3000 rpm.  Winchesters are somewhere near
   127	3600 rpm.  This is just a concept, it has not been tried, but we have
   128	reason to believe very strongly that you can apply two substrates instead
   129	of one.  With the same laser, or frequency, you will be receiving two
   130	different signals from two different substrates.  At the same speed at
   131	the same spot, two sets of information will be coming to you.  Two
   132	different molecules, with two different signals.
