     4	     I am  not currently  an AT  user.  Otherwise,  I might have discovered
     5	     this before now and probably at  some inconvenience.  I pass it on  so
     6	     that many of  you who are  using AT's might  be aware of  the possible
     7	     inconvenience Big Blue has planned  for AT users.  The following  item
     8	     appeared in the Lotus Magazine, Vol.2, No.9, September, 1986 (p. 26).

    15	                           Preventing PC AT Amnesia
    16	 
    17	     If you've never pulled the cover off an IBM PC AT, you may not realize
    18	     that there is  a battery inside.   If that news  comes as a  surprise,
    19	     there's  no  need  to  be  embarrassed;  you  apparently have a lot of
    20	     company.
    21	 
    22	     According  to  Alex  Papakyriakou,  general  manager  of International
    23	     Battery Corp.  (IBC) (Reseda, Calif.),  a sizable number of IBM  PC AT
    24	     owners  --  including  some  large-scale  corporate buyers -- are just
    25	     realizing  this  because  the  batteries  are beginning to fail.  This
    26	     causes  the  loss  of  not  only  time  and  date information but also
    27	     internally stored configuration information like the machine's  memory
    28	     size and type and number of disk drives.
    29	 
    30	     When  a  PC  AT's  battery  fades  out,  you  are  forced to enter the
    31	     configuration info each time you start the system -- a tedious process
    32	     that  leads  to  a  quick  search  for  a  replacement  battery.   The
    33	     difficulty users face  in finding the  batteries is what  got IBC into
    34	     the AT battery business.
    35	 
    36	     IBC was  getting requests  for the  6-volt lithium  units and couldn't
    37	     find  a  supplier  until  they  came  across  Tadiran, a major battery
    38	     manufacturer headquartered in Israel.
    39	 
    40	     IBC  obtained  exclusive  rights  to  aftermarkets  sales of Tadiran's
    41	     AT-compatible batteries and is selling them by mail order for  $27.50,
    42	     which Papakyriakou claims  is $15 less  than IBM sells  them for.  But
    43	     IBC is likely to have competition soon in this lucrative market.   The
    44	     market-research firm Dataquest (San Jose, Calif.) estimates there will
    45	     be more  than one  million IBM  AT's in  use by  the end of 1986, each
    46	     having a battery that runs out of juice every one to three years.
