    30	                    STRAPPING ON THE UTILITY BELT
    31	
    32	   If it seems like we went a little overboard with Windows utilities 
    33	this month, well, we did. So if your digital tool belt feels a little 
    34	light, stock up on tools here. Check out the New Releases and New 
    35	Versions sections for the latest, best Windows performance gadgets.
    36	
    37	   This month we covered everything from Program Manager replacements to 
    38	a cool .SCR Windows screen blanker. What else can I say about utilities? 
    39	Not much. Thinking about utilities makes me want to shut up and go 
    40	optimize my hard disk. So, I think I will.
    41	
    42	   Don't forget to wear safety goggles, always keep the blade guard 
    43	engaged, and enjoy this month's selection.
    44	
    45	   Psst! If anyone feels the urge to giggle at my Near StartUp tip in 
    46	the SOLUTIONS section, I challenge you to put all these utilities in 
    47	YOUR Windows StartUp group and keep all individual bells and whistles 
    48	straight!

    69	                Look at Fonts Before They're Installed!
    70	
    71	   Less than a decade ago fonts were high-ticket items: you could easily 
    72	spend $50 or more for a good set of Times Roman and Helvetica clones. 
    73	Today you can buy a CD-ROM disc of 2000 fonts for under $10. Bargain 
    74	font collections abound. So many fonts, so little hard-disk space! The 
    75	question everybody's asking now is, "How can I tell whether I like any 
    76	of these fonts without having to go through the rigmarole of installing 
    77	ALL of them?" If you're using Fonter v6.2, a welcome update to a 
    78	versatile Windows 3.1 font utility, the answer is simple: "Just preview 
    79	them!"
    80	
    81	   Yes, in Version 6.2, Fonter adds the ability to preview -- and even 
    82	print specimen sheets -- of fonts that aren't installed yet on your 
    83	system. Just click on the Preview button and double-click to choose a 
    84	bare .TTF file, and you can see how it'll look before it's installed and 
    85	eating system resources. Fonter even gives you the option of temporarily 
    86	installing a font, so it'll be good for just your current Windows 
    87	session, and then remove itself.
    88	
    89	   Fonter remains one of the best utilities for viewing and printing 
    90	samples of installed fonts, too. You can print a sample sheet of a 
    91	single font, which shows sample text formatted in various point sizes, 
    92	along with extended characters -- or you can click on File/Print Book 
    93	[All Fonts], go to bed, and wake up in the morning to a ream of font 
    94	samples.
    95	
    96	   One of my favorite Fonter features is the ability to type my own 
    97	sample text for onscreen viewing at various point sizes. That makes it a 
    98	piece of cake to audition fonts for titles on crucial page layouts. I 
    99	also like it that Fonter can map characters onto a graphic of a 
   100	keyboard, and then let you print it. This helps if you're trying to type 
   101	in foreign language characters, like Cyrillic or Hebrew -- you'll never 
   102	let that printed keyboard reference out of your sight!

   110	         If DOOM Were Reincarnated as a Fantasy Adventure Game . . .
   111	
   112	   Let's see. If DOOM were a fantasy adventure game, I bet that instead 
   113	of shooting aliens with shotguns, our hero would blast demon creatures 
   114	with a magic wand. And I bet that instead of searching for ammo packs, 
   115	he would seek out magic talismans and charms.
   116	
   117	   What do you know?! That's exactly what happens in Heretic, a 3-D 
   118	virtual-reality, combat-type game (in the vein of Wolfenstein 3-D and 
   119	DOOM). Heretic is in fact from id Software, creator of DOOM, and Raven 
   120	Software. If you've played DOOM, then you know all you need to know to 
   121	play Heretic: blast the creatures, test the walls for hidden doors, grab 
   122	all the loot you can find, look for more powerful weapons (like the 
   123	ethereal crossbow -- much more lethal than the wand), and restock your 
   124	weapon supply (you never have all the ethereal arrows you'd like!).
   125	
   126	   The setting is pure gothic with its dark, dank dungeons, monolithic 
   127	rock formations and pools of dark liquid. The cast of enemies fits right 
   128	in. There are red "bat demons," mummy creatures and other evil things. 
   129	The bat demons have a neat trick. They can hover near the ceiling and 
   130	pound you good. If they're hovering directly overhead, you can't see 
   131	them, but you can usually run away a bit, turn around, and shoot them 
   132	down. They explode very satisfyingly. Like DOOM, Heretic offers 
   133	interesting architectural touches, such as angled passageways, narrow 
   134	stairways and ramps.
   135	
   136	   I found some aspects of game play more difficult in Heretic than in 
   137	DOOM. In certain rooms there appear to be hair triggers that raise the 
   138	walls to reveal a horde of enemies -- who quickly overpower you. You 
   139	think you're alone, and then pow! This happens a lot.
   140	
   141	   Heretic is even bigger than DOOM, taking up about 2.88MB of disk 
   142	space -- compressed. We at Software Shopper have not figured out how to 
   143	split up the files yet (I don't think we'd want to try). But if you're 
   144	on a BBS -- and you have to be to read this! -- then finding Heretic 
   145	will be a piece of cake. Just look for the DOS game with the highest 
   146	recent download count.
   147	
   148	   A number of auxiliary programs come with Heretic. DM.EXE, the 
   149	DeathManager, is used as a front end for network and modem play with 
   150	Heretic and DOOM. DWANGO.EXE is client software for a multiplayer online 
   151	service (call up any time to play DeathMatches in DOOM or Heretic 
   152	against people from around the world) -- you'll need a credit card for 
   153	billing if you try DWANGO. IPXSETUP.EXE lets you play Heretic and DOOM 
   154	over an IPX network. And SERSETUP.EXE lets you play over a modem or 
   155	serial cable.
   156	
   157	   The system requirements have gotten stiffer. Heretic calls for a 
   158	33MHz 486 or better CPU, 4MB of RAM, and about 10MB of hard-disk space. 
   159	It costs $40 to register and receive new levels.
   160	
   161	   Heretic is a blast from the past in more ways than one, but I can't 
   162	help but love it. I love all violent 3-D, VR, combat-style games equally 
   163	(though the bloodier, the better). It's something my therapist and I are 
   164	working on. I WISH he would stop trouncing me in DeathMatches, though.

   171	
   172	   Music Sculptor is the most fun I've had with my sound card in a long 
   173	time. Have you ever had a little ditty running around in your head that 
   174	you think would make a great song, and you want to record it? But you 
   175	can't figure out those complicated MIDI sequencers? And you'd feel silly 
   176	humming into a tape recorder? Music Sculptor, from Alpha Omega Software, 
   177	is a MIDI sequencer you can live with.
   178	
   179	   Music Sculptor draws a portion of the piano keyboard onscreen and 
   180	invites you to click out some notes with your mouse. Once you've got 
   181	your ditty down, you can click on the Record button to save it for 
   182	posterity as a .MID file. Or, if you're like me and you can't resist, 
   183	you can play with the music and add extra layers of sound (tracks, that 
   184	is, to us sonically savvy folk), trying to insert a little harmony.
   185	
   186	   Besides the piano view, there's a track view, and you can have both 
   187	views onscreen at the same time. For each track you can select which 
   188	instrument you'd like to play the notes. (This is where I had most of my 
   189	fun! It's neat to have your melody and bass lines swap instrument 
   190	assignments, just to hear what happens.) Here you can also instruct 
   191	certain tracks to play or be silent while you're recording new tracks. 
   192	Before you know it, you'll have clicked yourself into a symphony (or, 
   193	perhaps, a cacophony <G>).
   194	
   195	   Sample MIDI files are included, and they're modifiable, of course -- 
   196	which means you'll get your chance to try and improve upon them. I wish 
   197	the program had included the ability to print scores of the music in 
   198	musical notation, but I probably wish for too much. Music Sculptor makes 
   199	a great first program for the budding composer. It requires a Windows 
   200	3.1-supported sound card.

   208	                    A Handy Command Line for Windows
   209	
   210	   You can take the girl out of DOS, but you can't take the DOS out of 
   211	the girl.
   212	
   213	   Sometimes Windows is too much. Sometimes you just plain miss the old 
   214	DOS prompt! Say you want to check the time/date stamp of a file over in 
   215	some subdirectory. Do you really want to wait on File Manager to load 
   216	and then do all the clicking required to get to see the file 
   217	particulars? No! Who would? Shelling out to DOS and typing a simple DIR 
   218	command is much faster. But SmilerShell from Bardon Data Systems has an 
   219	even faster solution for situations like these: it brings the command 
   220	line to Windows!
   221	
   222	   If you add SmilerShell's icon to Windows' StartUp group, it'll be 
   223	ready and waiting to carry out your typed commands. The small, three-
   224	line window can be set to stay on top, or act like any other window (and 
   225	be fetched by the Task Manager or a quick ALT-TAB). The top "line" 
   226	consists of the title bar, as you'd expect of any Windows application. 
   227	But SmilerShell adds a neat touch by giving you the option of displaying 
   228	the time there. The bottom line is the prompt line, and the middle line 
   229	is for the menu options.
   230	
   231	   If you're thinking menu options would be out of place in a program 
   232	whose job is to replace the DOS prompt, think again! We found a terrific 
   233	use for SmilerShell's Edit/Paste command. When we write about DOS tips 
   234	and tricks for PCM Online, this is how we go about it: we type the 
   235	command in a Word for Windows file as we're writing the article, then we 
   236	shell out to DOS (to test), type the command, jump back into Word to 
   237	verify we typed it exactly as it appears, jump back to DOS and execute 
   238	the command. That's a lot of wasted time when you consider SmilerShell 
   239	lets you do this: select and copy the command from Word, jump over to 
   240	SmilerShell and do an Edit/Paste, then press ENTER to execute the 
   241	command.
   242	
   243	   SmilerShell offers many other ways to speed up keyboard operations. 
   244	It keeps a command history of all your typed commands, so you can re-
   245	execute them without retyping them. It also supports aliases, which 
   246	means you can just type "d" and have SmilerShell know you mean "dir." 
   247	(You can also configure the F2 through F12 keys as aliases.) SmilerShell 
   248	includes a fast directory change command, which works over multiple 
   249	drives, and can take you instantly to a subdirectory many levels deep. 
   250	And SmilerShell lets you launch both DOS and Windows programs just by 
   251	typing their filenames at the prompt! So now DOS touch-typist junkies 
   252	can merely type SOL instead of CLICK on an ICON (yecch! <G>) to play 
   253	their favorite Windows game.

   260	                       <>  SUPERBAR v2.0B  <>
   261	              Add Custom Toolbars to Windows Applications
   262	
   263	   You know what the problem with Windows Write is -- besides the lack 
   264	of a spelling checker? It's square, man. There are no jazzy icons to 
   265	click. Bor-ing. Ever wish there were a way to add toolbars to Windows 
   266	programs that lack them (or even add new special-purpose toolbars above 
   267	and beyond existing toolbars)? Your wish is granted in SuperBar, a 
   268	shareware utility you can use to create custom, configurable toolbars.
   269	
   270	   The buttons on a SuperBar toolbar can be assigned to an application 
   271	menu command -- or to a recorded macro. SuperBar has its own macro 
   272	definition feature, which is great for automating tasks in programs that 
   273	lack macro capability.
   274	
   275	   I used SuperBar to jazz up Windows Write with the expected File New, 
   276	File Open and Print buttons, but I also created buttons to bring up the 
   277	Fonts dialog box and to set justification. The toolbar appeared between 
   278	the title bar and the menu bar, pushing the menu bar down a line. (The 
   279	default toolbar position is at the top, below the title bar, though you 
   280	can assign it to the left, right or bottom of the application's window.) 
   281	The toolbars remain in effect as long as SuperBar is running. So you can 
   282	load and exit Windows Write all day, and that toolbar will stick tight 
   283	(as long is SuperBar is running too). If you want to ensure your 
   284	toolbars are always available, consider plopping SuperBar's icon in 
   285	Windows' StartUp group.
   286	
   287	   Toolbar button setup is taken care of inside SuperBar. To create a 
   288	toolbar for an application, select that application from SuperBar's task 
   289	list (the application must currently be open). SuperBar displays all the 
   290	application's available menu options, and you choose which ones you 
   291	would like to turn into buttons. Then you assign an icon to each button. 
   292	If you can't find a suitable icon from the 80+ icon samples, you can use 
   293	the provided icon manager program to create and paint your own.
   294	
   295	   Custom toolbars not only increase efficiency by placing common 
   296	commands on a toolbar for point-and-click ease -- they also speed 
   297	learning. It's much easier to train new users to click on graphical 
   298	toolbar buttons than to dig through menus. Say the new worker at the 
   299	office can't seem to remember the name of File X, and then forgets how 
   300	to prep it -- just create a toolbar button that runs a macro to call up 
   301	File X, do the formatting, and print the prized report, all in one step!
   302	
   303	   SuperBar is one program I'm glad to have in my utility belt.

   322	     TrueType fonts in whatever size you like. You can also
   323	     "zoom" characters for close-up views, see ANSI charts and
   324	     even a keyboard layout showing which keyboard keys to type
   325	     to get which characters -- this is great for symbol,
   326	     dingbat and foreign-language fonts. You can also print
   327	     samples of single fonts, or print a "book" of all your
   328	     fonts. New features in v6.2 include the ability to preview
   329	     TrueType fonts (before installing!); print specimen sheets
   330	     of previewed fonts; install TrueType Fonts for a single

   339	     Windows-supported sound card (like the Sound Blaster) or a
   340	     MIDI interface? Then try Music Sculptor. It's an
   341	     easy-to-use MIDI sequencer with a graphical representation
   342	     of a piano keyboard. You can enter music on this keyboard
   343	     with your mouse, or enter it from an external MIDI keyboard
   344	     if you have one. It's a lot of fun to record a main melody
   345	     line on the first track, then try to "click out" some
   346	     harmony on other tracks while the melody is playing. (It's
   347	     also fun to change instrument assignments.) There is no
   348	     score, or sheet-music view. Sample MIDI files are included.

   356	     Windows still does so poorly? Try SmilerShell: it's like a
   357	     DOS command line in Windows, but even more powerful! It

   744	     duplicated files. It can take the place of File Manager
   745	     with file-launching and its directory-tree view. This view
   746	     shows the amount of disk space consumed by a directory and
   747	     all its nested subdirectories (good to know when you're
   748	     trying to free up space). Directory trees and other types
   749	     of usage reports can be printed. The interface looks and
   750	     works great with a colorful, intuitive toolbar and optional
   751	     onscreen help.

   989	     important talent is letting you create nested groups in
   990	     Program Manager: yes, now you can put groups within groups
   991	     -- as many DOS menuing utilities let you do. It's an
   992	     intuitive way to organize applications for both beginners
   993	     and pros, and it's neater. Other handy things Plug-In
   994	     Manager does is let you decorate Windows' title bars with
   995	     the time, date, a stopwatch and a resource watchdog (to
   996	     keep an eye on your free drive space, for example). You can
   997	     also set alarms and change the look of your mouse cursor.
   998	     Another important feature is the "Power Button": a
   999	     Task-Manager-like tool that helps you quickly get where you
  1000	     want to go (the button is located conveniently at the left

  1011	     lets you run Windows programs, DOS programs and even DOS
  1012	     internal commands. It gives you a fast directory change
  1013	     command (over multiple drives). Plus, it gives you aliases;
  1014	     does pipes and redirection; and offers a built-in

  1125	What Is Shareware?
  1126	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  1127	
  1128	                          WHAT IS SHAREWARE?
  1129	                           HOW DOES IT WORK?
  1130	
  1131	   Shareware operates on the "try before you buy" system. Authors allow 
  1132	their programs to be copied and passed around, among friends, over BBS 
  1133	systems or through services such as Software Shopper.
  1134	
  1135	   If you find a shareware program is of value to you and you intend to 
  1136	keep and use it, then you must register the program with the author (pay 
  1137	a fee -- the amount varies). Registration gives you various benefits, 
  1138	depending on the author. (Common benefits include printed manuals, newer 
  1139	versions and support if you happen to run into problems.) The fee also 
  1140	helps motivate authors to improve their programs and develop new ones.
  1141	
  1142	   No part of the money collected by Software Shopper, or any other 
  1143	service, goes to the program authors. Those charges are strictly 
  1144	copying, handling and shipping fees, and they are non-refundable. The 
  1145	author gets paid only when you send in your registration fee. We supply 
  1146	all copies of shareware programs on both 5-1/4- and 3-1/2- inch disks, 
  1147	although there is an extra charge of 75 cents per disk for 3-1/2-inch 
  1148	(720K) format. There is no extra charge for 3-1/2-inch 1.44MB (high-
  1149	density disks).
  1150	
  1151	   Programs are separated into subdirectories on a disk when we make up 
  1152	special orders for you (most of our orders are special orders). A short 
  1153	instruction sheet is packaged with the disk, but your disk label tells 
  1154	you the name of the subdirectories.
  1155	
  1156	   Generally, our orders are processed within 24 business hours of 
  1157	receipt. Due to volume, we may run a day or so behind from time to time. 
  1158	Our business hours are generally 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through 
  1159	Friday.
  1160	
  1161	   We disclaim any damage that any of the software in Software Shopper 
  1162	may cause and cannot guarantee that any particular system follows sound 
  1163	business practices. Our sole liability, in any event, consists of a 
  1164	refund of the copying and distribution charge we make for providing 
  1165	software to you.
  1166	
  1167	   We invite and solicit your comments and suggestions about Software 
  1168	Shopper and the shareware which we make available through it. Our 
  1169	shareware library contains many more programs than appears in this issue 
  1170	of Software Shopper. If you have a specific need, please contact us on 
  1171	our Customer Assistance line, (502) 228-4492. We will do everything we 
  1172	can to try to help.
  1173	
  1174	
  1175	   Falsoft, Inc. is an approved vendor and associate member of the 
  1176	Association of Shareware Professionals (ASP). ASP wants to make sure 
  1177	that the shareware principle works for you. If you are unable to resolve 
  1178	a shareware-related problem with an ASP member by contacting the member 
  1179	directly, ASP may be able to help. The ASP Ombudsman can help you 
  1180	resolve a dispute or problem with an ASP member, but does not provide 
  1181	technical support for members' products. Please write to the ASP 
  1182	Ombudsman at 545 Graver Road, Muskeg, MI 49442, or send a CompuServe 
  1183	message via CompuServe Mail to ASP Ombudsman 70007, 3536.

  1187	About the Catalog
  1188	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  1189	
  1190	   The rest of Software Shopper Online is our database or "catalog" -- 
  1191	the majority of the shareware programs in our archives, which are 
  1192	neither new nor updated this month. While you'll see more than a 
  1193	thousand programs listed in the database, please keep in mind that more 
  1194	is coming! We're still in the process of converting records, so future 
  1195	issues will be more complete. If your favorite shareware title is 
  1196	missing from the database now, it will probably soon be added.
  1197	
  1198	   Also, a note about how the database is structured. There really is a 
  1199	method to the madness! We divided the database into 32 sections (usually 
  1200	32): 16 broad categories for DOS and the same 16 broad categories for 
  1201	Windows. (Categories include Business, Education, Games, Utilities, 
  1202	etc.) Each rather generic category is in turn broken down into smaller 
  1203	subcategories -- for example, "Business" is broken down into Accounting, 
  1204	Contact Management, Personal Finance and others.
  1205	
  1206	   When you read the database, it will look like each category starts 
  1207	out nicely in alphabetical order -- but then does several A-Z cycles! 
  1208	The reason for this is that the subcategories are also in alphabetical 
  1209	order. Yes, we COULD have separated the database into distinct 
  1210	subcategory files, but your SysOps would have wanted to murder us for 
  1211	making them deal with hundreds of files instead of the slightly unwieldy 
  1212	32! As long as you know the subcategory structure is there, you should 
  1213	have no trouble finding the kinds of programs you're interested in.
  1214	
  1215	   We do not have registration fee information available for all titles, 
  1216	so for those "Author's fee" fields that show a fee of "0.00," please do 
  1217	not assume that registration is free!
  1218	
  1219	
  1220	>>[ An Invitation to Shareware Authors ]<<
  1221	
  1222	   Shareware authors: we invite you to monitor our catalog to help keep 
  1223	us up-to-date with your titles. Although we receive the ASP Advantage 
  1224	CD-ROM and get disks sent to us by shareware authors, we don't get 
  1225	everything we'd like -- so we turn to BBSs and online services for files 
  1226	we're missing (and of course read the vendor info to make sure we're 
  1227	allowed to distribute the programs we download). We'd rather that the 
  1228	programs came directly from you -- and we're sure you'd prefer that too. 
  1229	Feel free to send us your updates and new titles. Our mailing address 
  1230	is: Software Shopper, P.O. Box 385, Prospect, KY 40059. Our shipping 
  1231	address is: Software Shopper, The Falsoft Building, 9509 U.S. Highway 
  1232	42, Prospect, KY 40059.
  1233	
  1234	   We've got to tell you about our new high-density line. Many shareware 
  1235	vendors are still putting out titles on low-density floppy disks only, 
  1236	but we're proud to have launched our "HD" line: which means we can 
  1237	competitively distribute titles like DOOM, Raptor, GeoPublish and 
  1238	NeoBook Pro on high-density disks (complete with nifty, laser-printed 
  1239	labels). So, large programs don't upset us! We do request that, when you 
  1240	send us large programs, you break them into chunks that would also fit 
  1241	on 1.2MB floppy disks. But if you can't, that's OK -- we'll just insert 
  1242	a note asking readers to order the program on 1.44MB disks only.
