     1	OREM, Utah--February 21, 1992 SoftSolutions Technology Corporation (STC)
     2	announced today the latest release of their document management software
     3	-- SoftSolutions for DOS, version 3.0. SoftSolutions 3.0 has been enhanced
     4	to provide an all-encompassing approach to document management. Version
     5	3.0 undertakes the management of all enterprisewide documents, regardless
     6	of their source of creation.
     7	
     8	SoftSolutions organizes documents originating from multiple sources (i.e.,
     9	PC LANs, UNIX systems, documents stored on Laptops or Notebooks, hardcopy
    10	documents, and documents created from the use of SoftSolution's Portable
    11	Mode when the network is down), and creates a comprehensive depository of
    12	accessible information.
    13	
    14	Version 3.0 makes information readily available by providing a balance of
    15	features that meet both the needs of end users and system administrators.
    16	The following enhancements benefit both end users and administrators:
    17	Portable Mode operations, equipped with fully-functioning Profiles and
    18	searching features; completely customizable profile screens; activity
    19	logs; personal worklists; simple management of compound documents;
    20	extensive integration and "launch" facilities for other network
    21	applications; improved document security; and, customizable menu options,
    22	error messages, and help screens.
    23	
    24	Alvin Tedjamulia, Vice President of STC, explains that "SoftSolutions is
    25	the only company currently offering Portable Mode operations, which solves
    26	significant problems encountered by organizations managing documents
    27	created by busy users." SoftSolutions can easily coordinate the fragmented
    28	flow of information generated by executives who may have created documents
    29	on their home PC, on a laptop while traveling, or in another office. A
    30	dataset, for example, in one office may welcome "guest documents" from a
    31	dataset of another office. SoftSolutions 3.0 manages the entire process,
    32	including status tracking, mass checkin/check-out, and moving documents
    33	and Profiles. Welcoming guest documents or inviting them back to their
    34	home dataset is efficiently coordinated in SoftSolutions 3.0 with a single
    35	request.
    36	
    37	SoftSolutions 3.0 beta users agree that some of the most impressive aspects
    38	of version 3.0 is the comprehensive offering of features and the product
    39	configurability/flexibility. "Users have given valuable input on the
    40	enhancements of SoftSolutions 3.0 and the resulting cooperative effort
    41	with current users has paid off in the most impressive product we have yet
    42	delivered....SoftSolutions 3.0," said Kenneth W. Duncan, President of
    43	STC.
    44	
    45	SoftSolutions 3.0 fully supports SoftSolutions Image Manager and
    46	SoftSolutions Intelligent Search. SoftSolutions for Windows will have the
    47	same functionality as the DOS version and will be available second quarter
    48	of 1992.
    49	
    50	Memory requirements for SoftSolutions 3.0 are 640 Kb on the PC. A Server
    51	Enhancement Module (SEM) providing true client/server computing, exists
    52	for NetWare 3.1x, IBM AIX, Digital Ultrix, Data General UX, SUN/OS, SCO
    53	UNIX, and Interactive UNIX.
    54	
    55	SoftSolutions 3.0 will ship the end of February. SoftSolutions 3.0 sells
    56	for $495.00 per File Server, $295.00 per additional station, and $1,995.00
    57	for the Server Enhancement Module.
