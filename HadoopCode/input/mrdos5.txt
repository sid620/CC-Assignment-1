     1	DOS Level 3:
     2	
     3	The world of DOS is a large one.  There are many, many commands with optional
     4	switches in the realm of file management.  Fortunately, like most software
     5	there is a flow and feel to DOS.  After you are familiar with the core
     6	commands, looking up additional ones and figuring out how to use them becomes
     7	easier.  The pattern is a DOS word (DIR, COPY, DEL....) followed by the
     8	necessary, minimum information to make it go.  For example:
     9	
    10	      A>DIR B:                  DIR only needs the drive the directory is
    11	                                desired
    12	
    13	      A>Copy C:sample.doc B:    COPY needs 3 pieces of information - what file
    14	                                on which drive is to be copied to which drive
    15	
    16	      A>DEL B:Test.EXE          DEL needs 2 pieces of information - what file
    17	                                on which drive to delete
    18

    21	SOFTWARE VERSIONS
    22	-----------------
    23	Software is labeled with a version number.  With each subsequent release of
    24	the product, the version number increases.  The reason for these upgrades are
    25	to rid "bugs" (problems) within the software, significant product
    26	improvements, and/or to exploit new hardware advancements.  In general,
    27	anything created on an earlier version of a software will work with a later
    28	version of the same software.  This is known as upward compatibility.  The
    29	reverse is rarely true.
    30	
    31	DOS first hit the market as version 1.0 in 1981.  It has gone thru many
    32	upgrades as new hardware components became available and new DOS features were
    33	added.  Currently DOS 4.X is available.  However, most systems are still
    34	using DOS 3.X versions.  For a single user system, any DOS version over 2.1
    35	is probably adequate.  If you are using high density 3.5 inch floppy
    36	drives, you will need at least DOS 3.X.
    37	
    38	When application software is purchased, DOS version requirements are noted on
    39	the package as well as RAM requirements.
    40	
    41	
    42	FILE ALLOCATION TABLE
    43	---------------------
    44	As was discussed earlier formatting a new floppy disk prior to use,
    45	electronically superimposes a grid system on the disk.  Each grid intersection
    46	(sector) is numbered.  The location of files pieces on a disk are noted in a
    47	File Allocation Table (FAT) on each disk.  When a file is copied to a disk,
    48	the FAT is checked for available sector locations.
    49	
    50	The FAT is like an index to the location of file pieces on the disk.  File
    51	portions DO NOT have to be in adjacent sectors.  As a disk repeatedly has new
    52	files copied to it and old files deleted, files become fragmented - portions
    53	of the file exist in non-adjacent sectors.  This situation is referred to
    54	as non-contiguous sectors.  Data integrity is not affected by this situation,
    55	but the speed in which data can be retrieved is.  There are many third party    
    56	
    57	
    58	
    59	
    60	
    61	products to "defragment" a disk.  If the programs you will be using are disk
    62	intensive - like accounting or database management, you will notice a slowing
    63	of program execution over time as files become fragmented.
    64	
    65	When a file is deleted from a disk, the contents are not wiped from the
    66	sectors, rather the file name is removed from the FAT and the associated
    67	sectors are now simply declared available for new data.  This is important to
    68	understand because deleted files are actually still on the disk but their
    69	locations are now not considered off limits.  Again, many third party software
    70	products are available to undelete these files.
    71	
    72	If you do delete a file, try not to use the disk until the proper utility
    73	software is available to reverse the deletion.  With more use, you are running
    74	the risk that the next file that is copied to the disk will occupy the
    75	sectors of file you wish to undelete.  If that should happen, you will not be
    76	able to undelete the "old" file.
    77	
    78	Some popular third party utility tools to defragment a disk and allow
    79	undeletion include PC TOOLS, NORTON UTILITIES, MACE UTILITIES, VOPT DISK
    80	OPTIMIZER.
    81	
    82	BATCH FILES
    83	-----------
    84	Batch files are a DOS tool that allow you to automatically execute 1 or more
    85	DOS commands sequentially.  A more detailed explanation can be found under
    86	Hard Disk Dos sections.
    87	
    88	For example, you are tired of changing default drives, subdirectories and
    89	typing the word LOTUS each time you wish to enter into the LOTUS 123
    90	spreadsheet program.  The 3 steps required are:
    91	
    92	                    A>C:
    93	                    C>cd\lotus
    94	                    C>lotus
    95	
    96	These steps can be combined with a single BATCH file called LOT.BAT.
    97	
    98	To build:
    99	
   100	                  C>copy con:lot.bat  --- Begin creating a file called lot.bat
   101	                    C:
   102	                    cd\lotus
   103	                    lotus
   104	                    <F6>              --- End building and save to disk by
   105	                                          pressing the <F6> function key
   106	
   107	Now, each time LOT is entered at the DOS prompt, the commands within the
   108	LOT.BAT file are automatically executed sequentially.
   109	
   110	                C>lot
   111

   113	
   114	
   115	
   116	
   117	REDIRECTION
   118	-----------
   119	Redirection refers to having input or output come or go to devices other than
   120	the standards of Keyboard (Input) and Monitor (output).  In DOS we expect to
   121	enter commands from the Keyboard and have the results displayed on the
   122	Monitor.
   123	
   124	          A>DIR           --- Gives a directory of the A drive disk on the
   125	                              monitor
   126	
   127	          A>DIR >PRN      --- PRN  means to send the results of this command
   128	                              to the printer
   129	
   130	          A>DIR >LIST.TXT --- Now the output of this command is put into a
   131	                              file on the A disk called LIST.TXT  (any
   132	                              filename could have been used)
   133	
   134	The greater than sign ( > )  used above was to REDIRECT the output to a
   135	Printer and a Disk File rather than the default output device; the monitor.
   136	This is useful for getting a hard copy print-out of a particular disk's
   137	contents.
   138	
   139	PIPING - FILTERS
   140	----------------
   141	Piping is a way of telling DOS to transfer the output from one command to be
   142	the input for another command.  Piping is a form of redirection except DOS
   143	will create a temporary file on a disk to accomplish the task.
   144	
   145	Piping usually involves the use of special commands, termed Filters, to accept
   146	data, do something with it, and then pass it to the next step.  There are 3
   147	standard filters used by DOS in piping:
   148	
   149	    FIND - used to search a file directory for a specified string of text
   150	    MORE - used to display one 1 screen of output at a time
   151	    SORT - used to sort disk filenames
   152	
   153	The symbol used by DOS to indicate a Piping operation is the vertical bar (|).
   154	
   155	Examples:
   156	
   157	         A>DIR |sort     --- Will display on the monitor the list of files
   158	                             on the A disk, BUT in filename alphabetic order.
   159	
   160	         A>DIR |sort/+10 --- Will display on the monitor the list of files
   161	                             on the A disk, BUT by alphabetic order of the
   162	                             filename extensions.  Extensions are 10
   163	                             characters from the left on the screen during a
   164	                             DIR.
   165	
   166	        A>DIR |sort >prn  -- Same as the 1st example except the results of
   167	                             this command will be printed out.
   168	
   169	        A>DIR |sort >SAM.D - Same as the 1st example except the results of
   170	                             this command will be saved in a file on the disk
   171	                             called  SAM.D
   172	                                                                                
   173	
   174	
   175	
   176	
   177	
   178	        A>DIR |sort |more -- Will display in sorted order one screen at a time
   179	
   180	        A>DIR |find "05-14-89"  -- Will display a list of files that were last
   181	                                   changed on May 14, 1989
   182	
   183	        A>DIR |find "SALES"     -- Will display a list of files that have the
   184	                                   word SALES in the file name
