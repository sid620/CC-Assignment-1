    17	  TITLE:
    18	      DOS "Cannot find command interpreter" and a message
    19	      incorrect DOS version
    20	      Bad or missing COMMAND.COM
    21	
    22	  OVERVIEW:
    23	      The command interpreter (usually COMMAND.COM) can be specified in
    24	      CONFIG.SYS (SHELL=...) or in AUTOEXEC.BAT (SET COMSPEC=...).  It may be
    25	      invoked in both.  If not specifically invoked, the default is
    26	      COMMAND.COM.
    27	
    28	  ISSUES/COMMENTS:
    29	      1) When DOS is unable to locate the specified command interpreter on
    30	      disk, it issues the message "Bad or missing command interpreter", and the
    31	      system halts.
    32	
    33	      2) STACKER's incremental installation copies COMMAND.COM (and/or whatever
    34	      interpreter is specified by SHELL=...)into the newly created volume, so
    35	      that it can be located even when drives are swapped.  Free space
    36	      installation does not provide for this.
    37	
    38	      3) On systems where the DOS version has been changed or where a boot
    39	      diskette has been used, the "Incorrect DOS version" message may result
    40	      from a discrepancy between the COMMAND.COM files on the boot drive and on
    41	      the STACKER volume.
    42	
    43	  RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
    44	      1) Ensure there is agreement between the SHELL= and SET COMSPEC=
    45	      statements in CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT, respectively.
    46	
    47	      2) Ensure there is a copy of the command interpreter in the drive and
    48	      directory indicated.  For example, if SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM, verify
    49	      that:
    50	          a) the \DOS directory is present on the boot drive (and swapped
    51	          STACKER volume, if applicable);
    52	          b) COMMAND.COM (or the command interpreter) is located in the
    53	          directory/ies.
    54	
    55	      3) Compare the file sizes, dates and times of COMMAND.COM wherever
    56	      present (root and \DOS directories).
