    17	     Modem transmission speed is the source of a lot of 
    18	confusion, even among otherwise informed computer and modem 
    19	users.  The root of the problem is the fact that the terms "baud" 
    20	and "bits per second" are used interchangeably and 
    21	indiscriminately.  I strongly suspect this is a result of the 
    22	fact that it's easier to say "baud" than "bits per second," 
    23	though misinformation has a hand in it, too.
    24	     If you've ever found yourself confused by the relationship 
    25	between bits and baud rate, or if you think that a modem's baud 
    26	rate is the same as the number of bits or characters it transmits 
    27	per second, please read this article carefully; I guarantee to 
    28	clear up the confusion and disabuse you of any false concepts ...
    29	
    30	                      Bits per second (bps)
    31	     Bits per second is a measure of the number of data bits 
    32	(digital 0's and 1's) transmitted each second in a communications 
    33	channel.  This is sometimes referred to as "bit rate."
    34	     Individual characters (letters, numbers, etc.), also 
    35	referred to as bytes, are composed of several bits.
    36	     While a modem's bit rate is tied to its baud rate, the two 
    37	are not the same, as explained below.
    38	
    39	                            Baud rate
    40	     Baud rate is a measure of the number of times per second a 
    41	signal in a communications channel varies, or makes a transition 
    42	between states (states being frequencies, voltage levels, or 
    43	phase angles).  One baud is one such change.  Thus, a 300-baud 
    44	modem's signal changes state 300 times each second, while a 600-
    45	baud modem's signal changes state 600 times per second.  This 
    46	does not necessarily mean that a 300-baud and a 600-baud modem 
    47	transmit 300 and 600 bits per second, as you'll learn in a few 
    48	lines.
    49	
    50	                   Determining bits per second
    51	     Depending on the modulation technique used, a modem can 
    52	transmit one bit--or more or less than one bit--with each baud, 
    53	or change in state.  Or, to put it another way, one change of 
    54	state can transmit one bit--or more or less than one bit.
    55	     As I mentioned earlier, the number of bits a modem transmits 
    56	per second is directly related to the number of bauds that occur 
    57	each second, but the numbers are not necessarily the same.
    58	     To illustrate this, first consider a modem with a baud rate 
    59	of 300, using a transmission technique called FSK (Frequency 
    60	Shift Keying, in which four different frequencies are turned on 
    61	and off to represent digital 0 and 1 signals from both modems).  
    62	When FSK is used, each baud (which is, a gain, a change in state) 
    63	transmits one bit; only one change in state is required to send a 
    64	bit.  Thus, the modem's bps rate is also 300: 
    65	
    66	     300 bauds per second X 1 bit per baud  =  300 bps
    67	
    68	     Similarly, if a modem operating at 1200 baud were to use one 
    69	change in state to send each bit, that modem's bps rate would be 
    70	1200.  (There are no 1200 baud modems, by the way; remember that.  
    71	This is only a demonstrative and hypothetical example.)
    72	     Now, consider a hypothetical 300-baud modem using a 
    73	modulation technique that requires two changes in state to send 
    74	one bit, which can also be viewed as 1/2 bit per baud.  Such a 
    75	modem's bps rate would be 150 bps:
    76	
    77	       300 bauds per second X 1/2 baud per bit  =  150 bps
    78	
    79	     To look at it another way, bits per second can also be 
    80	obtained by dividing the modem's baud rate by the number of 
    81	changes in state, or bauds, required to send one bit:
    82	
    83	        300 baud
    84	     ---------------  =  150 bps
    85	     2 bauds per bit
    86	
    87	     Now let's move away from the hypothetical and into reality, 
    88	as it exists in the world of modulation.
    89	     First, lest you be misled into thinking that "any 1200 baud 
    90	modem" should be able to operate at 2400 bps with a two-bits-per-
    91	baud modulation technique, remember that I said there are no 1200 
    92	baud modems.  Medium- and high-speed modems use baud rates that 
    93	are lower than their bps rates.  Along with this, however, they 
    94	use multiple-state modulation to send more than one bit per baud.
    95	     For example, 1200 bps modems that conform to the Bell 212A 
    96	standard (which includes most 1200 bps modems used in the U.S.) 
    97	operate at 300 baud and use a modulation technique called phase 
    98	modulation that transmits four bits per baud.  Such modems are 
    99	capable of 1200 bps operation, but not 2400 bps because they are 
   100	not 1200 baud modems; they use a baud rate of 300.  So:
   101	
   102	     300 baud X 4 bits per baud  =  1200 bps
   103	
   104	                                or
   105	
   106	          300 baud
   107	     ------------------  =  1200 bps
   108	      1/4 baud per bit
   109	
   110	     Similarly, 2400 bps modems that conform to the CCITT V.22 
   111	recommendation (virtually all of them) actually use a baud rate 
   112	of 600 when they operate at 2400 bps.  However, they also use a 
   113	modulation technique that transmits four bits per baud:
   114	
   115	     600 baud X 4 bits per baud  =  2400 bps
   116	
   117	                                or
   118	
   119	          600 baud
   120	     ------------------  = 2400 bps
   121	      1/4 baud per bit
   122	
   123	     Thus, a 1200-bps modem is not a 1200-baud modem, nor is a 
   124	2400-bps modem a 2400-baud modem.
   125	     Now let's take a look at 9600-bps modems.  Most of these 
   126	operate at 2400 baud, but (again) use a modulation technique that 
   127	yields four bits per baud.  Thus:
   128	
   129	     2400 baud X 4 bits per baud  =  9600 bps
   130	
   131	                                or
   132	
   133	          2400 baud
   134	     ------------------  =  9600 bps
   135	      1/4 baud per bit
   136	
   137	                   Characters per second (cps)
   138	     Characters per second is the number of characters (letters, 
   139	numbers, spaces, and symbols) transmitted over a communications 
   140	channel in one second.  Cps is often the bottom line in rating 
   141	data transmission speed, and a more convenient way of thinking 
   142	about data transfer than baud- or bit-rate.
   143	     Determining the number of characters transmitted per second 
   144	is easy: simply divide the bps rate by the number of bits per 
   145	character.  You must of course take into account the fact that 
   146	more than just the bits that make up the binary digit 
   147	representing a character are transmitted when a character is sent 
   148	from one system to another.  In fact, up to 10 bits may be 
   149	transmitted for each character during ASCII transfer, whether 7 
   150	or 8 data bits are used.  This is because what are called start- 
   151	and stop-bits are added to characters by a sending system to 
   152	enable the receiving system to determine which groups of bits 
   153	make up a character.  In addition, a system usually adds a parity 
   154	bit during 7-bit ASCII transmission.  (The computer's serial port 
   155	handles the addition of the extra bits, and all extra bits are 
   156	stripped out at the receiving end.)
   157	     So, in asynchronous data communication, the number of bits 
   158	per character is usually 10 (either 7 data bits, plus a parity 
   159	bit, plus a start bit and a stop bit, or 8 data bits plus a start 
   160	bit and a stop bit).  Thus:
   161	
   162	             300 bps
   163	     -----------------------  =  30 characters per second
   164	      10 bits per character
   165	
   166	            1200 bps
   167	     -----------------------  =  120 characters per second
   168	      10 bits per character
   169	
   170	            2400 bps
   171	     -----------------------  =  240 characters per second
   172	      10 bits per character
   173	
   174	                          Common speeds
   175	     The most commonly-used communications rates for dial-up 
   176	systems (BBSs and online services like CompuServe, DELPHI, and 
   177	GEnie) are 300, 1200, and 2400 bps.  A few older systems--
   178	especially Telex systems--communicate at 110 bps, but these are 
   179	gradually going the way of the dinosaur.  4800 and 9600 bps 
   180	modems are generally available, but few online services or BBSs 
   181	accommodate them.  This will be changing in the near future, 
   182	however, with the cost of high-speed modem technology decreasing 
   183	as the demand for it increases.
   184	     Modems with even higher bps rates are manufactured (19,200 
   185	and up) but these are not used with dial-up systems; the upper 
   186	limit on asynchronous data transmission via voice-grade telephone 
   187	lines appears to be 9600 bps.  The use of higher transmission 
   188	rates requires special dedicated lines that are "conditioned" 
   189	(i.e., shielded from outside interference) as well as expensive 
   190	modulation and transmission equipment.
