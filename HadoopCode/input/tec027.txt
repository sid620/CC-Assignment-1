    12	Note:  If Stacker has not yet been installed, see Tech020: INSTALLING
    13	STACKER ON AN IBM PS/1.
    14	
    15	BACKGROUND:  
    16	The PS/1 is a ROM based machine.  It normally boots from its 
    17	"Built-In-DOS" on the ROM D: drive and  reads config.sys and Autoexec.bat 
    18	from there as well.  The PS/1 can be reconfigured, using"CUSTOMIZE", 
    19	to read Config.sys and Autoexec.bat from C: so that the Stacker devices 
    20	may be loaded.  If the boot process is not "CUSTOMIZed" before loading 
    21	Stacker, the data may appear to be "missing" because the STACKER.COM device 
    22	has not been loaded.
    23	
    24	A 4 Quadrant system menu is normally loaded from ROM upon boot. It consists 
    25	of 1.Information 2.Microsoft works 3. Your software and 4. IBM DOS.  You can 
    26	shell to a DOS prompt by pressing <shift F9>. It is installed in Config.sys: 
    27	"INSTALL=D:\SHELLSTB.COM".
    28	
    29	"CUSTOMIZE How System Starts" is a program normally in the C:\DOS directory,
    30	but is copied into the Stacker drive upon "STACKING... the existing drive".
    31	The program also should be on the DOS diskettes that came with the
    32	machine.  In the Customize program you can configure the computer to
    33	Read the system files, Config.sys, and Autoexec.bat  from C: or D:
    34	Note: THE CUSTOMIZE DEFAULTS CAN BE RESTORED BY POWERING DOWN THE
    35	SYSTEM, HOLDING DOWN THE 2 MOUSE BUTTONS, AND POWERING BACK UP.
    36	
    37	RECOVERY:
    38	Note:   You MUST have the DOS program diskette containing CUSTOMIZ.EXE
    39	or a bootable floppy to proceed.  Nothing can be done until you have
    40	one of these!
    41	
    42	If you have the DOS program diskette:
    43	1. Insert the DOS diskette in A: and Run the CUSTOMIZE program from the
    44	   Dos Quadrant.  (You can also <shift> F9 to get to a prompt and run 
    45	   A:Customiz.)
    46	
    47	If you do not have the DOS diskette but have a bootable system
    48	diskette:
    49	1. Insert the system diskette in A: and from the system menu press
    50	   Alt+SysRq to force the system to boot from A: (the D: Rom drive 
    51	   will not be accessible after this.)
    52	2. Copy config.sys to A: and reboot
    53	3. From the DOS directory on the Stacker drive (C:) run CUSTOMIZ.
    54	
    55	Running CUSTOMIZE:
    56	1. The third line from the bottom of the screen says "Read
    57	   Config.sys:". Click on "from Disk"
    58	2. The next line down says " Read Autoexec.bat". Click on "From Disk"
    59	3. The last line says "Disk to Read from". Click on C:
    60	4. Press <ENTER> to save changes and exit.
    61	5. Reboot the machine.
    62	6. This will bring you to a C: prompt.  Edit the Config.sys on C:\ and
    63	   add the line:
    64	      Install=D:\SHELLSTB.COM to restore the system Quadrant menu.
    65	7. Restart the system for changes to take affect.
