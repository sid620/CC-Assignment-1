    13	Writers of software programs that are being placed on the various
    14	bulletin boards with permission to users of the board to use the pro-
    15	grams for non-commerical purposes should mark those programs as:
    16	
    17			(c) 1981 John Smith
    18	
    19	It is not necessary to register the work with the Copyright Office
    20	in Washington, D.C. to get copyright protection.  In fact, it is
    21	not necessary to put the copyright notice on to get protection, but the
    22	notice is required if you want to sue for infringement, as is regis-
    23	tration with the Copyright Office.  If the omission of the notice was
    24	inadvertent or distribution was for a limited purpose only (like to 
    25	one's family or a friendly group getting together) the lack of notice
    26	does not cause any harm.  However, the absence of the notice will
    27	allow anyone who copies your program to claim it was placed in the 
    28	public domain for all to use for any purpose.  Only the copyright
    29	can be licensed and if the other fellow doesn't know you are
    30	claiming a copyright, he can claim innocence in this copying.
    31	
    32	Registration is simple.  Just send a note off to the Copyright
    33	Office, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. and ask for the forms
    34	needed to register a computer program.  They will send you a 
    35	package of stuff which will include the forms and instructions
    36	on how to file for registration.  Fill out the form, send it back
    37	with two copies of your printout showing the copyright notice on it and
    38	$10 and soon the Copyright Office will send you a certificate
    39	saying the program is registered.  
    40	
    41	That's all there is to it!
    42	
    43	Copyright should not be confused with patent.  Patents have to be
    44	original invention and protect the idea embodied in an object or
    45	machine.  Copyright protects any kind of a literary, musical, or
    46	artist work, including all kinds of graphics and sculpture.  It 
    47	also protects recorded audio and visual works such as phonorecords
    48	and videotapes and films.
    49	
    50	Neither type of protection guarantees no one will steal your effort,
    51	any more than the police department guarantees no one will burgle
    52	your house.  The law against burglary and the law against copyright
    53	infringement, however, give the owner of the house or the copy-
    54	right a kind of right to recover from the thief.  Better chance,
    55	too, in the case of a software thief who copies for commercial
    56	purposes!
    57	
    58	A copyright will not protect your fine idea for bit-twiddling - it
    59	will protect your expression of it - that is, no one can copy
    60	your program directly although they can do some bit-twiddling
    61	themselves to accomplish the same purpose you aimed at.  For
    62	example, no one can copyright the idea of the play "Romeo and
    63	Juliette" of a pair of lovers whose families are feuding.  But
    64	Romeo and Juliette could have been copyrighted by William
    65	Shakespeare and anyone who used his lines in another play about
    66	the same thing or a similar thing would have infringed his
    67	copyright.  
    68	
    69	Is that clear? Or just confusing?  Well, Einstein's theory,
    70	E = MC*C could not be either patented (it is a natural law)
    71	or copyrighted (it is an idea) but Albert's book about his
    72	theory could be, was, and is copyrighted!
    73	
    74	If it comes down to protecting you program through a lawsuit,
    75	it is necessary to have the notice and the registration.  The
    76	registration is prima facie evidence of the validity of your
    77	copyright.  And should you succeed in proving your copyright,
    78	the court will issue an injunction against a copier without 
    79	permission, will ultimately give you either his profits, your
    80	losses (should you start selling the program yourself), and
    81	your attorney's fees if he was an intentional infringer.  It
    82	could be a good deal for you, if your program is really great -
    83	and some that I have seen on the CBBS's are great!
    84	
    85	If I can help with advice - but not filing lawsuits- drop
    86	me a note on the Mill Valley RBBS (415-383-0473) or to
    87	the above address. I don't practice law - I write about it
    88	and copyright is one of the areas I write about.
