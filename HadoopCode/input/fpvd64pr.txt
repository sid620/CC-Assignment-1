    13	FREMONT, CA--April 3, 1995-- Orchid Technology announced today 
    14	the merging of high-performance graphics and digital video playback 
    15	with its latest market entry, the Fahrenheit ProVideo 64. With HyperDriverTM

    17	digital video, the Fahrenheit ProVideo 64 begins a new era in graphics 
    18	card performance.

    20	The Fahrenheit ProVideo 64 combines S3's latest 968 chipset and video

    22	suite of software drivers for CAD, business and graphics is included,
    23	as well as Orchid's new HyperDriver Windows software. Orchid's HyperDriver 
    24	technology is geared towards multimedia and digital video playback 
    25	applications. While providing compatibility with today's high refresh
