     1	February 11, 1992-Laurel, MD-XDB Systems, Inc., the SQL technology leader,
     2	expands its relational database management product line by unveiling
     3	XDB-LINK at NetWorld '92, a new software package that permits PC
     4	applications to transparently access mainframe DB2 data. "Developers can
     5	use XDB-Workbench as well as the interactive XDB tools to query, update,
     6	report, browse and enter data directly to DB2," states Robert Strom, XDB's
     7	Senior Development Manager. With XDB-LINK it is now possible to develop
     8	cooperative processing applications in order to use MIS resources more
     9	efficiently. For example, applications and data that reside in distributed
    10	areas can be viewed as a single data center.
    11	
    12	The XDB-LINK product consists of two components: XDB-LINK Gateway, which
    13	resides on the PC, and the XDB-LINK Host, which resides on the mainframe.
    14	These components communicate via LU6.2 protocols to satisfy DB2 SQL
    15	requests originated from the PC. The XDB-LINK works with IBM's CICS/APPC
    16	product and VTAM.
    17	
    18	XDB-LINK is based on the client-server architecture and supports DOS, OS/2,
    19	and Windows clients. In a development environment, the XDB-LINK product
    20	extends systems level testing to the PC environment by providing access to
    21	mainframe production data. In a production environment, XDB's application
    22	tools (XDB-Workbench, XDB-Tools, XDB-C) and LAN applications can now
    23	access data residing in mainframe DB2 as a database server.
    24	
    25	One significant advantage of the XDB-LINK package is increased
    26	productivity. The data transfer procedure has been streamlined since
    27	developers can now transfer data between the PC and the mainframe in one
    28	step. In addition, data access using XDB-LINK's bulk fetch processing
    29	feature is comparable to local 3270 access. Mike Meyer, Principle Systems
    30	Associate with Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company in Newark, NJ said,
    31	"With the LINK's bulk fetch processing feature I can save a significant
    32	amount of time and resources required to fetch multiple rows from DB2."
    33	
    34	IBM is scheduled for commercial release of their Distributed Relational
    35	Data Architecture (DRDA) standard next year and XDB intends to supports
    36	DRDA. XDB Systems is committed to providing quality relational database
    37	management products and services. The price range for the XDBLINK is
    38	$21,000 to $36,000 depending upon a company's mainframe CPU size. For more

    43	
    44	February 11, 1992 - Laurel, MD-XDB Systems, Inc., the SQL technology
    45	leader, will be featuring a new version of their SQL Engine for OS/2 at
    46	NetWorld '92. The XDB-SERVER is a high performance, multi-user database
    47	system that brings the power and integrity of mainframe database systems
    48	to LANs. The core of XDB's product line is the 100% DB2 compatible Engine.
    49	Now with the XDB-SERVER for OS/2 version 2.41, DB2 applications become
    50	portable to client-server platforms. Since the XDB-SERVER is network
    51	independent, DB2 compatibility can exist on multiple platforms and
    52	operating systems.
    53	
    54	The main benefits of the XDB-SERVER for OS/2 version 2.41 are increased
    55	power and performance. Rusty Fiste, XDB's Director of Development, states,
    56	"XDB's new, enhanced SERVER for OS/2 obtains significant performance gains
    57	because of its improved internal buffer management system which minimizes
    58	disk accesses." Multiple physical disk volumes are now supported. Now
    59	developers can utilize multiple disk volumes to separate various data
    60	objects like indices and databases thereby decreasing the amount of time
    61	required to retrieve data. The size of a database is also no longer
    62	limited by the size of one OS/2 disk volume. In addition, the XDB-SERVER
    63	for OS/2 version 2.41 has greatly enhanced its query optimization.
    64	
    65	The XDB-SERVER takes maximum advantage of OS/2 technology. One of the Beta
    66	sites chose XDB-SERVER because they wanted DB2 compatibility on their PC
    67	LAN. Igor Kruglyak, Assistant Vice President & Systems Architect with
    68	Merrill Lynch in Somerset, NJ, states, "We have many users that need to
    69	share DB2 data and the XDB-SERVER provides the fully DB2 compatible
    70	technology for mainframe applications to migrate to the LAN environment."

    73	
    74	February 11, 1992 - Laurel, MD-XDB Systems, Inc., the SQL technology
    75	leader, will be featuring Version 2.41 of the XDB-Workbench. The new
    76	engine supports both DOS and OS/2 and is designed to provide an
    77	unprecedented level of compatibility with IBM's mainframe relational
    78	database DB2. The XDB-Workbench 2.41 enables COBOL programmers to develop,
    79	test, and run DB2 applications in an inexpensive and friendly PC
    80	environment. XDB has added numerous functions to their new version of
    81	their Workbench 2.41 in order to fine tune their compatibility with DB2.
    82	Rusty Fiste, XDB's Director of Development says, "This latest version of
    83	our workbench delves deep into the distinctive characteristics of DB2."
    84	XDB's reserved words were also made fully compatible with DB2. "This
    85	release further underscores our commitment to ensure 100% compatibility
    86	between XDB's Workbench and DB2," states Rusty Fiste.
    87	
    88	"XDB's Workbench version 2.41 is well suited for downsizing mainframe DB2
    89	applications, where DB2 compatibility is a crucial consideration. XDB has
    90	made a remarkable commitment to capture the subtle intricacies of the
    91	DB2/SQL engine," says Jonathan Sayles, Director of Education Services for
    92	The Systems Group and a nationally recognized author on relational
    93	technology. Rick Slade, Senior Research Analyst at Sara Lee in
    94	Winston-Salem, North Carolina said, "I chose the XDB-Workbench for
    95	PC-based development because no recoding would be required when we moved
    96	our project back up to the mainframe."
    97	
    98	In addition to DB2 compatibility enhancements, other Product enhancements
    99	include additional referential integrity clauses, date/time functions,
   100	string functions, numeric functions, table privileges, and database
   101	privileges. The XDB-Workbench is the first PC SQL DBMS to provide the
   102	rigorous referential integrity constraints including cascading update, a
   103	fundamental data manipulation function that involves modifying data
   104	records in a continuous series so that all corresponding data is brought
   105	up to date.
   106	
   107	XDB Systems sets the standards for database management. Following the
   108	release of the XDBWorkbench Version 2.41, XDB Systems, Inc. will be
   109	releasing their new XDB-LINK product and their new version of the XDB
   110	SERVER engine for OS/2. The XDB-LINK permits PC applications to directly
   111	access mainframe DB2 data. Developers can use the interactive XDB tools to
   112	query, update, report, browse and enter data directly to DB2. The XDB
   113	SERVER for OS/2, a multi-user database system that brings the power and
   114	integrity of mainframe database systems to LANS, will feature increased
   115	power and memory size enhancements.
   116	
   117	--------------------------------------------------------
   118	XDB Systems, Inc. offers high performance database solutions that are
   119	powerful, easy to use, and compatible with industry SQL standards. The
   120	XDB-Workbench Version 2.41 makes your PC a complete DB2 applications
   121	development machine. The list price of the XDB-Workbench in $1500.00. For
   122	more information stop by Booth #633 or contact XDB Systems, Inc., 14700
