    65	----------------------------------------------------------------------
    66	
    67	(1)	What is OS/2?
    68	
    69	OS/2 is an advanced operating system for PCs and PS/2s with an 80286
    70	processor or better.  It was codeveloped by Microsoft and IBM and
    71	envisioned as the successor to DOS.
    72	
    73	It was designed from the ground up with preemptive multitasking and
    74	multithreading in mind.  It also protects applications from one another
    75	(a single misbehaved program will not typically disrupt the entire
    76	system), supports multimegabytes of physical RAM, and supplies virtual
    77	memory to applications as requested, breaking DOS's 640K barrier.
    78	
    79	As shipped, it does not support multiuser operation, although third
    80	parties have grafted multiuser capabilities onto the base operating
    81	system.  Remote-OS, OS2YOU, Citrix, and PolyMod2 are four such products.
    82	Remote-OS is published by The Software Lifeline, tel. 407-994-4466, and
    83	OS2YOU is available from the OS/2 shareware/freeware sources (see
    84	Question 9).  Citrix Systems can be reached at 305-755-0559.  PolyMod2's
    85	publisher, MemSoft, can be reached at 407-997-????.
    86	
    87	------------------------------
    88	
    89	(2)	What are the differences between versions?
    90	
    91	IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 (CSD Level 02000, see Question 24) is now widely
    92	available in retail release.  Version 2.0 will run only on machines with
    93	an 80386SX processor or better.  IBM is (now) developing OS/2 (and its
    94	Intel and non-Intel-based successors) independently but is involving
    95	third party PC manufacturers in its testing.  Improvements include the
    96	ability to preemptively multitask DOS, Windows 2.x, and Windows 3.0
    97	(real and standard mode) applications (without purchasing any of these
    98	environments) in separate, robust, protected sessions; an object-
    99	oriented Workplace Shell (WPS); a multiple operating system boot
   100	mechanism; new 32-bit programming interfaces; support for more than 16
   101	MB of physical RAM; and more third party device drivers.  It also
   102	provides EMS 3.2/4.0 and XMS 2.0/DPMI 0.9 (expanded and extended memory)
   103	services to DOS and Windows applications.  OS/2 1.x applications,
   104	unmodified, still run under OS/2 2.0.
   105	
   106	IBM OS/2 Version 1.3 is the last release of OS/2 to operate on PCs with
   107	80286 CPUs.  This version introduced built-in Adobe Type Manager (ATM),
   108	providing scalable typefaces for screen and printer, and reduced memory
   109	requirements.  Procedures Language/2 (a.k.a. REXX), a powerful batch-
   110	oriented programming language, became a part of Standard Edition with
   111	this release.  (A few OEMs are shipping Microsoft OS/2 Version 1.3, but
   112	Microsoft has all but abandoned OS/2 development.)
   113	
   114	OS/2 Version 1.2 was the first to incorporate the High Performance File
   115	System (HPFS, which supports long file names).  With this release IBM
   116	OS/2 added a dual boot mechanism and IBM Extended Edition introduced
   117	REXX.
   118	
   119	OS/2 Version 1.1 was the first to include the Presentation Manager (PM)
   120	GUI/API, now an integral part of the operating system.  Microsoft OEM
   121	versions added a dual boot mechanism with this release.
   122	
   123	OS/2 Version 1.0, introduced in 1987, was the first release of OS/2.
   124	Task switching was accomplished through a character-based shell and
   125	limited DOS compatibility was provided.
   126	
   127	------------------------------
   128	
   129	(3)	What is Extended Services/2?
   130	
   131	Prior to Version 2.0, IBM offered two separate packages with each
   132	release of OS/2: Standard Edition and Extended Edition.  Extended
   133	Edition included extra, bundled software products: the Communications
   134	Manager (for communication with IBM mainframes, minicomputers, and other
   135	hosts), Database Manager (a full, network aware, relational database),
   136	and LAN Requester.
   137	
   138	IBM has now unbundled the Extended Edition features, dropped LAN
   139	Requester from the package (now available separately, with IBM's LAN
   140	Server product), updated it for OS/2 2.0, and renamed it Extended
   141	Services/2 1.0.  ES/2, by itself, no longer includes the base operating
   142	system as Extended Edition once did.
   143	
   144	This new arrangement makes it easier to update the base operating system
   145	with CSDs (see Question 24).  And now ES/2 1.0 will run under OS/2 1.3
   146	Standard Edition as well as OS/2 2.0.  Also, ES/2 1.0, like OS/2 2.0
   147	itself, is designed to operate on both IBM and non-IBM systems (see
   148	Question 7).
   149	
   150	------------------------------
   151	
   152	(4)	How good is OS/2 2.0's DOS and Windows compatibility?
   153	
   154	OS/2 1.x justifiably earned a reputation for poor DOS compatibility.
   155	Since it was designed for the 80286, it could not run more than one DOS
   156	application at a time.
   157	
   158	The situation has changed dramatically with OS/2 2.0.  Version 2.0
   159	preemptively multitasks DOS and Windows (real and standard mode)
   160	applications in separate, protected sessions, without purchasing either
   161	environment.
   162	
   163	OS/2 2.0 provides a complete DOS emulation equivalent to DOS 5.0.  The
   164	operating system can provide each DOS application with up to 32 MB of
   165	EMS 4.0 (expanded memory), 16 MB of XMS 2.0 (extended memory), and/or
   166	512 MB of DPMI 0.9 (DOS Protected Mode Interface extended memory), all
   167	from its pool of physical and/or virtual memory (meaning you do not have
   168	to have as much RAM in your system as your applications request).  These
   169	limits are in addition to the up to 730K free conventional memory
   170	supplied to each DOS application, even after mouse and network drivers
   171	are loaded.  As in DOS 5.0, DOS code and device drivers may be loaded
   172	into high memory.  A 386 memory manager like QEMM or 386Max is not
   173	needed -- these features are provided by OS/2 2.0 directly.
   174	
   175	The DOS emulation allows customization of device driver sets -- each DOS
   176	application shares a systemwide CONFIG.SYS and the equivalent of its own
   177	CONFIG.SYS.  Also, there is a systemwide AUTOEXEC.BAT file; batch
   178	commands particular to each DOS application can be invoked using
   179	separate, application-specific batch files.  And many DOS Settings are
   180	provided to fine tune each DOS/Windows application's behavior (e.g.
   181	IDLE_SENSITIVITY, VIDEO_RETRACE_EMULATION, etc).  The most popular
   182	DOS/Windows applications on your hard disk will be migrated
   183	automatically when you install OS/2 2.0.
   184	
   185	In addition, OS/2 2.0 will boot one or more specific versions of DOS in
   186	separate sessions, to assist in running particularly difficult
   187	applications.  So, for example, it is possible to multitask DOS 3.3, DOS
   188	4.0, DOS 5.0, emulated DOS, and Desqview running atop DOS, all in
   189	separate sessions, either windowed or full screen, all with the same
   190	and/or separate device drivers, TSRs, environment variables, etc.  These
   191	boot images may be stored on a hard disk.  (Under OS/2 2.0, the commands
   192	VMBOOT, VMDISK, and the Installation Guide will assist in booting real
   193	versions of DOS.)
   194	
   195	Standard graphics modes (generally up to the resolution of the desktop;
   196	see Question 11) are supported in DOS windows, as are selectable text
   197	mode typefaces.  Cut/paste to/from windowed DOS applications is
   198	supported (to/from other DOS, OS/2, and Windows applications), including
   199	graphics cut/paste.  Theoretically, OS/2 2.0 will run up to 240
   200	simultaneous DOS/Windows sessions; the practical maximum depends on
   201	system resources.  OS/2 2.0 will provide math coprocessor emulation for
   202	DOS/Windows programs if a math coprocessor is not present or if the 386
   203	CPU's step level is below D0.  (Check your 80386's step level using the
   204	utility 386Step, available from the OS/2 shareware/freeware sources; see
   205	Question 9.  Run it under native DOS, i.e. not while running OS/2 2.0.)
   206	
   207	OS/2 2.0 will, in fact, run virtually all DOS applications in existence,
   208	including notorious ones such as Microsoft Flight Simulator, Wing
   209	Commander, Maple (latest version), MatLab (latest version), and others.
   210	Those that do not run generally fall into the following categories:
   211	
   212	(a)  Programs that use Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI) memory
   213	extenders or other extenders which require direct access to the 80386
   214	control registers.  Since such applications are also all but
   215	incompatible with Windows, most vendors have program updates for DPMI
   216	compatibility, which OS/2 2.0 does support;
   217	
   218	(b)  Application programs which attempt to directly address the physical
   219	sectors of an OS/2 managed nonremoveable hard disk drive.  Such programs
   220	include UnErase in Norton Utilities, for example.  Fortunately OS/2 2.0
   221	has a built-in UnDelete feature which is more robust than Norton's
   222	approach.  (Consult the online Command Reference for information on how
   223	to enable UNDELETE);
   224	
   225	(c)  Timing sensitive DOS applications.  Certain DOS programs that
   226	generate digitized sound through the PC's internal speaker may have
   227	distorted sound.  High speed, real time data collection may be
   228	compromised.  These problems can often be minimized or even eliminated
   229	using OS/2 2.0's DOS Settings.
   230	
   231	(d)  DOS programming debuggers.  DOS applications running under OS/2 2.0
   232	are not permitted to access the debug registers DR0-DR7 from a DOS
   233	session.  Also, DOS debuggers will not be able to set hardware
   234	breakpoints, and all read/write operations to debug registers in virtual
   235	8086 mode will be ignored.
   236	
   237	Generally DOS backup programs will work under OS/2 2.0, but they may not
   238	capture some of the OS/2 data (especially extended attributes) on the
   239	hard disk.  OS/2 backup tools are available, notably IBM's PMTape, Sytos
   240	Plus, EZTape/PM, and a port of GNUtar.  DOS-based disk caching software
   241	is not required since OS/2 includes a built-in, highly configurable,
   242	more efficient disk cache.
   243	
   244	DOS programs running under OS/2 2.0 are extremely fast.  A single DOS
   245	application (no other applications open) running full screen under OS/2
   246	2.0 typically achieves 95-97% of the performance it would have under
   247	native DOS.  If the DOS application performs any disk I/O it can
   248	actually operate faster than it would if running under native DOS.  It
   249	is not unheard of for disk intensive DOS applications to run twice or
   250	even three times as fast under OS/2 2.0.
   251	
   252	If pure DOS is absolutely required, OS/2 2.0 includes a utility called
   253	the Boot Manager.  The Boot Manager can provide a menu listing all the
   254	operating systems available on the system and will allow selection of
   255	any one at startup, with a default after timeout.  The OS/2 1.x DualBoot
   256	method is still available as well.  Consult the OS/2 2.0 Installation
   257	Guide for instructions on how to configure your system to use Boot
   258	Manager or DualBoot.  Note that OS/2 2.0 need not be installed on Drive
   259	C -- it can reside on other volumes.
   260	
   261	Compatibility with Windows, a popular DOS extender, is provided by Win-
   262	OS/2, an environment based on Microsoft's Windows source code.  It runs
   263	Windows 2.x and 3.0 real mode and standard mode applications under OS/2
   264	2.0, either on a full screen Windows desktop (with the familiar Program
   265	Manager and one or more Windows applications) or "seamlessly," alongside
   266	OS/2 applications on the WPS desktop.  "Seamless" operation is available
   267	in VGA and XGA resolutions with OS/2 2.0 as it ships; see Question 11
   268	for information on third party drivers.
   269	
   270	CVTICO, a popular utility available from the OS/2 shareware/freeware
   271	sources (see Question 9), will convert Windows icons for use by the OS/2
   272	Icon Editor and/or OS/2-specific programs.  (No conversion is necessary
   273	if the icons are to be used with Windows programs running under OS/2
   274	2.0.)
   275	
   276	OS/2 2.0 directly provides Windows enhanced mode features save one:
   277	services included in WINMEM32.DLL.  Windows applications which utilize
   278	this DLL (e.g. Mathematica 2.0, Omnipage Professional 1.0) will not run
   279	under OS/2 2.0.  Fortunately the number of WINMEM32 applications is few,
   280	and apparently the vendors of such applications will be shipping OS/2
   281	2.0 compatible updates.
   282	
   283	Windows applications are well integrated into the overall OS/2 WPS
   284	environment with DDE and Clipboard hooks, and OLE 1.0 is supported among
   285	Windows applications.  Adobe Type Manager for Win-OS/2 comes with OS/2
   286	2.0 (see Question 25).  Windows screen (for a full screen desktop) and
   287	printer device drivers will work under Win-OS/2.  Such notorious Windows
   288	applications as Word for Windows, Norton Desktop (save portions
   289	described above), Toolbook, and screen savers such as After Dark work
   290	fine under Win-OS/2.  Even the Windows Multimedia Extensions (and
   291	programs which utilize them) operate under Win-OS/2.
   292	
   293	Win-OS/2 departs from Microsoft Windows in that it allows more than one
   294	Windows desktop and can preemptively (rather than cooperatively)
   295	multitask Windows applications in separate, robust, protected sessions.
   296	Also, while the enhancements incorporated into Windows 3.1 are
   297	functionally incorporated into Win-OS/2, Win-OS/2 is not technically
   298	Windows 3.1 compatible.  IBM has demonstrated 3.1-level Win-OS/2, and it
   299	is widely rumored that a free 3.1-level update will be available this
   300	summer.  Aside from the Windows 3.1 applets there are no Windows 3.1-
   301	specific applications available.  (Win-OS/2 will run the Windows 3.0
   302	applets, but it does not include them.  Instead, a vast assortment of
   303	true OS/2 2.0 applets are provided, including a spreadsheet, database
   304	program, asynchronous communications program, time planning/scheduling
   305	applets, a true programmer's editor, the System Editor, an icon editor,
   306	games, and much more.)
   307	
   308	------------------------------
   309	
   310	(5)	Where can I buy OS/2?
   311	
   312	Microsoft versions of OS/2 1.x are available only through OEMs (e.g.
   313	Compaq, Dell) or by purchasing Microsoft's LAN Manager 2.1 or SQL Server
   314	products.  Microsoft has all but ceased OS/2 development, working
   315	instead on Windows and the future, high-end NT (formerly OS/2 3.0).
   316	
   317	IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 is available from most software dealers (including
   318	Elek-Tek, tel. 708-677-7660) and directly from IBM (tel. 800-3-IBM-OS2,
   319	800-465-1234 in Canada).  OS/2 2.0 on 3.5 inch disks is part no.
   320	84F7586.  For 5.25 inch disks, 10G2991.  Media are high density.  For
   321	compact disc, 10G2992.  IBM OS/2 Version 1.3 is still available and may
   322	be ordered through many IBM dealers.
   323	
   324	IBM is trying to make OS/2 2.0 available everywhere DOS is purchased.
   325	If your dealer does not stock OS/2 2.0, call IBM's order line and
   326	mention the name of your dealer when you place your order.  IBM also has
   327	plans to bundle OS/2 2.0 with new PS/1, PS/2, and non-IBM systems.
   328	
   329	------------------------------
   330	
   331	(6)	How much does OS/2 2.0 cost?
   332	
   333	IBM OS/2 2.0 retails for USD 195.  However, in the United States
   334	introductory pricing is available through July 31, 1992, by calling
   335	IBM's order line (800-3-IBM-OS2).  Upgrades are free from OS/2 1.x, USD
   336	49 from any version of Windows, USD 99 from any version of DOS, and USD
   337	139 without an upgrade.  (An OS/2 1.x to 2.0 upgrade form, which you can
   338	print out and send in, is available from OS/2 shareware/freeware
   339	sources, see Question 9.  Version 1.x Extended Edition licensees receive
   340	a free upgrade to OS/2 2.0 and ES/2 1.0; Version 1.x LAN Server
   341	licensees receive LAN Server 2.0 at no charge.  All free OS/2 1.x to 2.0
   342	upgrades are available until August 24, 1992.)  Similar promotions are
   343	in effect in Canada and other countries.  Special pricing is available
   344	for multiple OS/2 licenses.  Educational discounts are available but may
   345	not apply to the introductory prices.  (IBM's educational inquiries line
   346	in the U.S. is 800-222-7257.)
   347	
   348	------------------------------
   349	
   350	(7)	What hardware do I need to run IBM OS/2 2.0?  Do I need a PS/2?
   351	
   352	You need any PC, PC compatible, PS/1, or PS/2 with at least an 80386SX
   353	CPU, 4 MB (6 MB or more strongly recommended) of RAM (configured as 640K
   354	base plus the remainder as extended memory, with at least 3968K total
   355	RAM after system use), a 60 MB or larger hard disk (with 15-30 MB free),
   356	a supported video adapter (CGA, EGA, VGA, 8514/A, XGA, or third party
   357	driver) with appropriate display, and a high density 3.5 or 5.25 inch
   358	floppy drive for installation.  A mouse or other pointing device is
   359	strongly recommended.  Allow extra RAM and hard disk space for OS/2-
   360	based networking, ES/2, and/or extra system loads (i.e. an extraordinary
   361	number of large applications running simultaneously).  When calculating
   362	hard disk space requirements, subtract space occupied by files already
   363	on the hard disk which are functionally included in OS/2 2.0 and may be
   364	deleted, e.g. DOS, a 386 memory manager, Windows, Adobe Type Manager
   365	with base typefaces, etc.
   366	
   367	The WPS will not operate with the Monochrome Display Adapter or the
   368	Hercules Monochrome Graphics Adapter.  Usually the WPS will fail to work
   369	with monochrome EGA.  However, some EGA adapters (e.g. Paradise
   370	Monochrome EGA Card, ATI EGA Wonder) will emulate all color EGA modes on
   371	TTL monochrome monitors and, thus, will work with the WPS.
   372	
   373	On (E)ISA bus machines, OS/2 specifically supports hard drive adapters
   374	which conform to the Western Digital chipset interface standard (i.e.
   375	nearly all MFM, RLL, IDE, and ESDI adapters) and Adaptec, Future Domain,
   376	and IBM SCSI adapters.  In addition, "generic" INT13 support is provided
   377	for all other hard disk adapters.  This "generic" support even embraces
   378	such devices as Iomega's Bernoulli and SyQuest's removeable media
   379	products.  CD-ROM support is included as well.  At present the OS/2 CD-
   380	ROM driver does not work with all brands, but the DOS device drivers,
   381	when suitably configured and installed, will still provide CD-ROM
   382	services to DOS/Windows programs.  Printer and plotter support is
   383	discussed in Question 12.
   384	
   385	Version 2.0 is explicitly supported on PC compatibles.  IBM is offering
   386	a money back compatibility guarantee in the United States.  Should OS/2
   387	2.0 fail to work on your compatible within the first 90 days of use, and
   388	should IBM be unable to fix the problem, your purchase price will be
   389	refunded.  To date over 200 non-IBM models have been tested in IBM's own
   390	labs.
   391	
   392	------------------------------
   393	
   394	(8)	What applications are available for OS/2?
   395	
   396	In addition to the thousands of applications available for DOS and
   397	Windows, there are a couple thousand OS/2-specific applications
   398	representing almost every category imaginable.
   399	
   400	The DOS/Windows applications with 16-bit OS/2-specific counterparts
   401	include Lotus 1-2-3, Freelance, Microsoft Word, Excel, Multiplan, Aldus
   402	Pagemaker, Ventura Publisher, Corel Draw, WordPerfect, DisplayWrite,
   403	DeScribe, Micrografx Designer, AutoCAD, Oracle, RBase, SAS, SPSS,
   404	HyperAccess/5, DynaComm, Pro-YAM, Borland Sidekick, Paradox, Wingz,
   405	Brief, QEdit, 4DOS, and many others.  In some cases DOS and OS/2
   406	versions ship together (e.g. Microsoft Word 5.5, Lotus 1-2-3 3.0,
   407	Wingz).
   408	
   409	OS/2 2.0 provides an attractive, 32-bit, Workplace Shell environment for
   410	new applications; many do not have DOS/Windows predecessors.  This new
   411	class of 32-bit applications will include Lotus 1-2-3, Freelance,
   412	cc:Mail, Notes, AmiPro, WordPerfect 6.0, N/Joy, DeScribe, Publisher's
   413	Paintbrush, PFS:Works, CorelDraw, HyperAccess, Sybase, FAX/PM, and many
   414	more.  Over 1000 new 32-bit OS/2 2.0 applications are slated for release
   415	in the next year.
   416	
   417	OS/2-specific versions of popular utilities include PKZIP/UNZIP, SEA's
   418	ARC, LHA, Zoo 2.1, many GNU tools, tens of different file finders,
   419	desktop clocks, calculators, and many more.  Programming languages
   420	include Assembler, C++, COBOL, Pascal, C, Fortran, BASIC, REXX (included
   421	with every copy of OS/2 2.0), Smalltalk, Modula-2, LISP, Forth, and
   422	still more, from vendors such as Borland, Jensen and Partners
   423	International, Watcom, Symantec (through its Zortech subsidiary), IBM,
   424	Microway, and many more.  A full 32-bit development package, GNU C/C++
   425	2.1, is available from OS/2 shareware/freeware sources (see Question 9).
   426	
   427	The IBM NSC BBS (tel. 404-835-6600) provides an online product database
   428	of OS/2-specific software.  A directory of OS/2 applications, IBM
   429	document number G362-0029-00, is published by Graphics Plus, tel. 800-
   430	READ-OS2.  TINF is an applications listing (for use with the OS/2 help
   431	facility) available from the shareware/freeware sources listed below.
   432	
   433	------------------------------
   434	
   435	(9)	Where can I obtain OS/2 shareware and freeware?
   436	
   437	Many BBSes hold large OS/2 libraries.  Fernwood (tel. 203-483-0348) has
   438	over 50 MB worth.  The OS/2 Shareware BBS (703-385-4325), Bay Area OS/2
   439	BBS (510-657-7948), and Greater Chicago Online (708-895-4042) carry
   440	still more.  The IBM NSC BBS has some shareware/freeware as well, along
   441	with CSDs (see Question 24) and the PS/2 Assistant (an invaluable
   442	resource for locating almost any sort of information on OS/2).  IBM
   443	Canada maintains several support BBSes (604-664-6466, 416-946-4255, and
   444	514-938-3022 at 2400 bps; 604-664-6464 and 416-946-4244 at 9600 bps).
   445	Information on IBM's new OS/2 BBS is included in the OS/2 2.0 package.
   446	
   447	The Usenet conference comp.binaries.os2 carries OS/2 software.  And
   448	several sites are available via anonymous ftp.  (No ftp?  Send a single
   449	line message with the word HELP to bitftp@pucc.bitnet or
   450	ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com to learn about ftp mail servers.)  They include
   451	(with Internet node numbers and subdirectories):
   452	
   453	hobbes.nmsu.edu             128.123.35.151     pub/os2, pub/os2-1.x

   460	
   461	The last site should not be accessed weekdays from 8:00 a.m. to 5:30
   462	p.m. Pacific Time.
   463	
   464	Other sources include CompuServe ("GO IBMOS2") and a Bitnet/EARN archive
   465	(send a single line message with the word HELP to
   466	LISTSERV@BLEKUL11.BITNET for more information).
   467	
   468	------------------------------
   469	
   470	(10)	I am having trouble installing OS/2 2.0.  What should I do?
   471	
   472	First consult the Installation Guide and other materials accompanying
   473	OS/2 2.0.  Make sure your PC meets the system requirements in Question
   474	7.
   475	
   476	And if the following instructions do not help, fall back on IBM's toll
   477	free technical support (available in the U.S. and described in the OS/2
   478	2.0 package).
   479	
   480	Certain PC compatibles have difficulty accepting OS/2 2.0 (CSD level
   481	02000 only; see Question 24), particularly AT bus systems with RLL, MFM,
   482	ESDI, or certain SCSI adapters (e.g. AMI SCSI adapters).  The problem
   483	usually appears in the form of FDISK errors, extremely slow copying to
   484	the hard disk, or a whining/grating noise emanating from the hard disk.
   485	
   486	IBM suggests a simple workaround.  First, DISKCOPY Diskette 1 of your
   487	OS/2 2.0 package.  Set aside your original Diskette 1 and use the copy
   488	from now on as if it were the original.  Using a text editor, modify the
   489	CONFIG.SYS file on Diskette 1 (the copy), replacing the line
   490	"basedev=ibm1s506.add" with "rem basedev=ibm1s506.add."  Boot the
   491	Installation Disk, and proceed through the installation procedure
   492	through the first five diskettes, then reinsert the Installation
   493	Diskette as directed.  Then after files have been copied from the
   494	Installation Diskette the system prompts you to remove the diskette and
   495	press ENTER to reboot.  Do so, but immediately reinsert the Installation
   496	Diskette as soon as the screen clears.  Follow instructions (insert
   497	Diskette 1 and press ENTER when prompted), then press ESC when prompted.
   498	At the OS/2 command line, type:
   499		RENAME C:\OS2\IBM1S506.ADD IBM1S506.XXX
   500		COPY C:\OS2\IBMINT13.ADD C:\OS2\IBM1S506.ADD
   501	replacing C: with the appropriate drive if you are installing elsewhere.
   502	Remove Diskette 1, then press CTRL-ALT-DEL to reboot and to finish
   503	installation.
   504	
   505	The mouse selection menu provided when installing is a bit confusing.
   506	The Logitech Mouse selection should be chosen if you have a Mouse
   507	Systems PC Mouse or a Logitech C7 or C9 serial mouse ONLY.  If you have
   508	another Logitech pointing device, it is Microsoft compatible when
   509	powered up, so select the appropriate Microsoft driver.  If you are
   510	using a Logitech C7 or C9 mouse and have been using native DOS, be sure
   511	to issue the command MOUSE PC (or MOUSE 2 PC if your mouse is attached
   512	to COM2) before booting into or installing OS/2.  Alternatively, turn
   513	off the system (to reset the mouse) before booting or installing OS/2.
   514	(The Logitech Support BBS can be reached at 510-795-0408.)
   515	
   516	Some PCs have trouble printing under OS/2 2.0.  This problem can often
   517	be traced to an interrupt conflict, or a substandard cable or printer
   518	adapter.  LPT1 uses IRQ 7 and LPT2, if installed, uses IRQ 5.
   519	Interrupts should not be shared on AT bus machines.  The SoundBlaster
   520	card, for example, comes set to IRQ 7.  Reset it to an unused interrupt.
   521	
   522	Make sure adapters with on board ROMs are not conflicting with other
   523	adapters.  For example, many SuperVGA adapters use large chunks of upper
   524	memory, and many hard disk adapters have on board ROMs which can be
   525	mapped into this area and conflict.  Adapters must cooperate in their
   526	use of memory and interrupts and must not share address space or
   527	interrupts.  Check your product manuals for more help.
   528	
   529	Be sure adequate free disk space is available before installing,
   530	including space for a swap file.  Drives compressed using Stacker or
   531	similar utilities should be uncompressed before installing (unless
   532	access to these drives is not needed).  OS/2 2.0 is not presently
   533	compatible with Stacker or similar utilities.  However, an OS/2 2.0
   534	version of Stacker is forthcoming.
   535	
   536	Do not select HPFS when installing if your machine has 6 MB of RAM or
   537	less.  Doing so will likely result in diminished performance.
   538	
   539	Automatic migration of your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files is not
   540	recommended.  If you have Windows 3.1 installed on your system do not
   541	migrate your Windows desktop.
   542	
   543	Be sure your CMOS setup parameters are set correctly, especially those
   544	relating to floppy drives.
   545	
   546	Be certain your adapter's sector translation mode is enabled if you are
   547	using an MFM, RLL, or ESDI hard disk drive with more than 1024
   548	cylinders.  The 1024 cylinder limit is a BIOS constraint.
   549	
   550	Certain Quantum IDE hard disk drives require a free ROM update from the
   551	manufacturer to work with OS/2.
   552	
   553	"Autoswitching" on non-IBM EGA adapters should be disabled (usually with
   554	a DIP switch or jumper setting).  In rare cases it may be necessary to
   555	switch third party VGA adapters into 8-bit mode.
   556	
   557	OS/2 is particularly sensitive to bad RAM (often reflected in TRAP 2
   558	error messages).  Use a thorough RAM testing utility, and try not to mix
   559	9 chip and 3 chip SIMMs/SIPPs.
   560	
   561	The HP DeskJet and DeskJet Plus printers work, without loss of
   562	functionality, using the Epson EPL-7000 driver (with Fast System Fonts
   563	disabled and bin selection ignored).  An explicit choice at installation
   564	is provided for the DeskJet 500 -- look carefully.  The Epson EPL-7000
   565	driver may also be used to operate the DeskJet 500.  As of this writing
   566	a DeskJet 500C color driver (for OS/2-specific programs) is not yet
   567	available.
   568	
   569	Allow several minutes for OS/2 2.0 to build your desktop (and display
   570	icons) at the end of installation -- take the Tutorial offered to you in
   571	the meantime.  Select Shutdown and reboot once after installation
   572	completes to ensure that DOS/Windows applications will operate properly.
   573	Avail yourself of the "Start Me" icon, the other online help, and the
   574	README file located in the root directory.  They will help in getting
   575	started with the Workplace Shell, the new paradigm introduced with OS/2
   576	2.0, and in properly configuring your system.
   577	
   578	When installing over a beta version of OS/2 be sure to reformat.
   579	
   580	------------------------------
   581	
   582	(11)	Will OS/2 2.0 work with my SuperVGA adapter?
   583	
   584	If you have a SuperVGA adapter, OS/2 2.0 should initially be installed
   585	using the standard VGA driver.  (If you have an ATI Vantage or Ultra
   586	adapter, or some other 8514/A hardware compatible adapter, install using
   587	the 8514/A driver.)  Then consult the README file OS/2 copies to your
   588	root directory for more information on SuperVGA support.
   589	
   590	OS/2 2.0 comes with basic mode switching capabilities to handle
   591	applications which utilize SuperVGA modes.  If OS/2 2.0 detects a
   592	SuperVGA adapter it will list two SuperVGA support files, VSVGA.SYS and
   593	BVHSVGA.DLL, in your CONFIG.SYS file.  (A replacement VSVGA.SYS file,
   594	fixing Tseng 4000 and TRAP E problems, is available from
   595	shareware/freeware sources under the name VSVGAFX1; see Question 9.)
   596	But to enable this mode switching support you must start a DOS full
   597	screen session, issue the command SVGA ON, EXIT, Shutdown, and reboot.
   598	SVGA ON creates a text file called \OS2\SVGADATA.PMI which describes
   599	your SuperVGA adapter to the system.  Then you may install high
   600	resolution drivers.  Aside from DOS applications (which may require
   601	their own drivers), OS/2 2.0 requires up to three high resolution
   602	support files:
   603	
   604	\OS2\DLL\DISPLAY.DLL                 Workplace Shell display driver
   605	\OS2\MDOS\WINOS2\SYSTEM\VGA.DRV      Win-OS/2 full screen driver
   606	\OS2\MDOS\WINOS2\SYSTEM\SWINVGA.DRV  Win-OS/2 "seamless" driver
   607	
   608	You may replace any one of these individually for high resolution
   609	operation in each given mode, but be sure to keep a backup copy of the
   610	original file(s).  The "seamless" Win-OS/2 and WPS desktop driver files
   611	must match (in terms of resolution and number of colors) if you wish to
   612	run Windows programs "seamlessly."  Any suitable Windows 3.0 SuperVGA
   613	driver will work as a Win-OS/2 full screen driver, but be sure to use
   614	the EXPAND utility (as described in README) when installing.
   615	
   616	OS/2 1.3 SuperVGA drivers often serve, with some limitations, as WPS
   617	desktop drivers.  Use the command DDINSTAL to replace DISPLAY.DLL.
   618	Setting IOPL=YES in CONFIG.SYS may be required when installing a new
   619	DISPLAY.DLL.
   620	
   621	As of this writing Trident is the only third party vendor with OS/2 2.0
   622	high resolution drivers, although several other manufacturers have
   623	promised drivers.  When available they will be provided through OS/2
   624	shareware/freeware sources (see Question 9).
   625	
   626	IBM was unable to test all SuperVGA adapters, so if you are experiencing
   627	problems report them through IBM's toll free support (in the U.S.,
   628	described in the OS/2 2.0 package) or to the adapter manufacturer.
   629	
   630	------------------------------
   631	
   632	(12)	Will OS/2 2.0 work with my printer?
   633	
   634	OS/2 2.0 includes support for the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet, DeskJet (see
   635	Question 10), and PaintJet families; IBM ExecJets, Proprinters,
   636	Quickwriters, Quietwriters, Pageprinters, and Laserprinters; Epson dot
   637	matrix and laser printers; Postscript devices; and other printers (e.g.
   638	Panasonic) compatible with these families.  A variety of IBM and HP
   639	plotters is also supported.
   640	
   641	DOS/Windows printer drivers continue to work for DOS/Windows
   642	applications.  OS/2 2.0 includes a large assortment of Windows printer
   643	drivers for Win-OS/2.  If necessary install Windows printer drivers
   644	using the Win-OS/2 Control Panel.  OS/2 2.0 and OS/2 1.3 printer drivers
   645	are interchangeable.
   646	
   647	If your printer is not compatible with one of the drivers supplied with
   648	OS/2, check with the printer manufacturer first then with OS/2
   649	shareware/freeware sources (see Question 9).  If you own an IBM printer,
   650	check with the Lexmark BBS (tel. 606-232-5653).
   651	
   652	------------------------------
   653	
   654	(13)	How do I access HPFS partitions on my hard drive without booting
   655		from the hard drive?  I'm getting error messages now -- how do I
   656		"repair" my hard disk?
   657	
   658	With IBM OS/2 2.0, insert the Installation Diskette, Shutdown (if
   659	necessary), and reboot.  When prompted insert Diskette 1 and press
   660	ENTER.  When prompted, press ESC.  You will be given an OS/2 command
   661	line prompt.  From there you can make necessary changes to your hard
   662	disk -- an OS/2 character mode text editor is handy for such changes.
   663	(Make sure you backup CONFIG.SYS before making any changes so that you
   664	can easily revert to the old version should things go wrong.)
   665	
   666	You may use this diskette boot method to run CHKDSK on your DOS FAT,
   667	OS/2 FAT, or OS/2 HPFS partitions.  After you reach the command line,
   668	insert Diskette 2.  Then type A:\CHKDSK X: /F to repair most kinds of
   669	damage to your hard disk, replacing X with the appropriate drive letter.
   670	OS/2 CHKDSK will also remark your hard disk, if possible, as accessible
   671	should OS/2 "lock it out" for some reason.
   672	
   673	The best way to avoid the need to perform CHKDSK is to always select
   674	Shutdown.  Click on the Workplace Shell desktop background using mouse
   675	button two to bring up the appropriate menu.  Also, avoid deleting OS/2-
   676	related files when using native DOS.
   677	
   678	------------------------------
   679	
   680	(14)	I can't install OS/2 2.0 from Drive B.  What's wrong?
   681	
   682	IBM OS/2 2.0 can only be installed from Drive A, like DOS (unless your
   683	BIOS supports booting from Drive B), or across a network (contact IBM
   684	for more information on network installation procedures).  If you have
   685	the wrong disk size go back to your dealer and obtain the correct media.
   686	Otherwise you could go inside your machine and swap floppy drive cable
   687	connectors, use your system's setup utility to set the new CMOS
   688	parameters, and then install OS/2 from the "new" Drive A.  Sometimes the
   689	floppy drive cable connectors will not be the same.  If so you can
   690	obtain an adapter plug.
   691	
   692	------------------------------
   693	
   694	(15)	Is there a Norton Utilities for OS/2?
   695	
   696	Not yet, although Norton Desktop, Norton Utilities, and Norton Commander
   697	all work under OS/2 2.0's DOS/Windows sessions (with limitations noted
   698	in Question 4).  But the GammaTech Utilities should fill the role.
   699	Contact their publisher at tel. 405-359-1219.  Note that OS/2 2.0 has a
   700	built-in UnDelete utility (see the README file or online help), and HPFS
   701	is resistant to fragmentation (see Question 18).
   702	
   703	------------------------------
   704	
   705	(16)	Sometimes OS/2 2.0 will freeze when I run an application?  What do
   706		I do?
   707	
   708	Before rebooting with CTRL-ALT-DEL, try CTRL-ESC.  Do not hit additional
   709	keys, do not move the mouse.  Wait up to a minute.  In most cases the
   710	Window List or an error message will pop up.  If you wish you may close
   711	the offending application at that point.  Try ALT-ESC if you have
   712	disabled CTRL-ESC in that application's DOS Settings.
   713	
   714	------------------------------
   715	
   716	(17)	My dealer doesn't know OS/2 from Unix.  How can I get answers to
   717		my OS/2 questions?
   718	
   719	If your question is not answered in this List, post a note to the
   720	appropriate Usenet conference: comp.os.os2.apps carries discussions
   721	related to finding or using any application running under OS/2,
   722	comp.os.os2.programmer addresses anything related to OS/2 programming,
   723	and comp.os.os2.misc is for any other OS/2-related discussion.  These
   724	groups are watched closely by IBM's OS/2 development team.  Also,
   725	comp.lang.rexx discusses REXX programming.  BLEKUL11 (on Bitnet/EARN)
   726	distributes its own OS/2 conference by mail; send a single line message
   727	with the word HELP to LISTSERV@BLEKUL11.BITNET for full instructions.
   728	An unedited mailing list is also available; send a single line message
   729	with the word HELP to LISTSERV@FRORS12.BITNET.
   730	
   731	Your local FidoNet BBS may carry OS/2 echo conferences.  If not, ask
   732	your system operator to get ahold of them.  CompuServe ("GO IBMOS2") and
   733	Prodigy are also excellent resources.
   734	
   735	The IBM NSC BBS was established as a support forum.  That BBS's message
   736	areas, product database, and PS/2 Assistant file(s) are invaluable
   737	resources.  Information on the new OS/2 BBS is included in the OS/2 2.0
   738	package.  In the United States IBM has toll free technical support
   739	(described in the OS/2 2.0 package; report problems there), an OS/2
   740	Hotline (general information, orders, upgrades, tel. 800-3-IBM-OS2), the
   741	HelpWare Center (tel. 800-PS2-2227), and an educational inquiries line
   742	(see Question 6).  In Canada call IBM Personal Systems Software at 800-
   743	465-1234.  OS/2 2.0 developers should contact the IBM Developer
   744	Assistance Program at 407-982-6408.  IBM offers classes worldwide to
   745	help in using and programming OS/2 2.0; call your local IBM branch
   746	office (or the OS/2 Hotline) for more information.
   747	
   748	OS/2 has its own magazines as well.  To subscribe to IBM Personal
   749	Systems Developer, a quarterly publication, telephone 407-982-1105.  For
   750	information on OS/2 Monthly send netmail to JDS Publishing at
   751	72550.2440@compuserve.com or telephone 908-985-8358.
   752	
   753	OS/2 2.0 books include Deitel and Kogan, "The Design of OS/2," Addison-
   754	Wesley, ISBN 0-201-54889-5; and Que's "Using OS/2 2.0."  Your bookstore
   755	should be able to order these and other titles.
   756	
   757	Any of the regular DOS or Windows resources (e.g. books, magazines,
   758	shareware/freeware sources) will be useful since both environments come
   759	with OS/2 2.0.
   760	
   761	------------------------------
   762	
   763	(18)	Why should I use HPFS?  What does it offer me?  Does it work with
   764		DOS?
   765	
   766	HPFS offers long file names (up to 254 characters including the path,
   767	greatly exceeding the "8 dot 3" limit in FAT/DOS file systems),
   768	resistance to file fragmentation, improved media error handling, and
   769	speedier disk operation, particularly on large hard disks, on systems
   770	with more than 6 MB of RAM.  HPFS is not case sensitive, although it
   771	does preserve case in file names.
   772	
   773	However, HPFS is not currently supported on removeable media, although
   774	some programs (e.g. BACKUP) preserve long file names on such FAT disks.
   775	Also, native mode DOS cannot access a HPFS partition.  However,
   776	DOS/Windows sessions running under OS/2 can use all files that conform
   777	to the "8 dot 3" naming conventions, even if they are stored on HPFS
   778	volumes.
   779	
   780	------------------------------
   781	
   782	(19)	I'm a Unix wizard.  How do I make OS/2 resemble Unix?
   783	
   784	A great number of GNU and Unix utilities have been ported to OS/2 native
   785	mode and are available from the shareware/freeware sources listed above.
   786	A uucp package, UUPC/Extended, is available via anonymous ftp from
   787	sun.soe.clarkson.edu, directory pub/uupc; netmail help@kew.com with
   788	questions.
   789	
   790	In addition, the Hamilton C Shell is available from Hamilton Labs, tel.
   791	508-358-5715 or netmail 3890321@mcimail.com.  The Thompson Toolkit, a
   792	Bourne-like shell, is published by Thompson Automation, tel. 206-224-
   793	1639.  Thompson offers a version of awk as well.  MKS (tel. 519-884-2251
   794	or netmail pat@mks.com) publishes a number of standard Unix utilities
   795	for OS/2.  Argosoft (tel. 510-795-7921) publishes ARGO/UX, a BSD 4.3
   796	Unix compatible environment.  For OS/2-specific X Windows server
   797	support, IBM provides an optional package available with its TCP/IP 1.2
   798	for OS/2.  The TCP/IP 1.2 base package includes a news reader as a
   799	sample application.
   800	
   801	DOS and Windows based utilities and aids still work fine under OS/2 2.0.
   802	
   803	------------------------------
   804	
   805	(20)	I prefer Windows.  How do I make OS/2 2.0 resemble Windows (or
   806		OS/2 1.3)?
   807	
   808	At first the Workplace Shell may seem strange and different.  Use it for
   809	a while and then decide.
   810	
   811	If you still feel you want change how OS/2 2.0 works, follow the
   812	instructions beginning on p. 29 in the "Migrating to the OS/2 Workplace
   813	Shell" booklet.
   814	
   815	------------------------------
   816	
   817	(21)	I would like to set up an OS/2 BBS.  What is available?
   818	
   819	OS/2 is an excellent environment for BBS operation (even using
   820	DOS/Windows software), including large multiline facilities.  Related
   821	software will enable FidoNet capabilities, gateways to Usenet/UUCP,
   822	nodelist processing, additional file transfer protocols, and more.
   823	
   824	Five popular OS/2-specific BBSes are Maximus and Simplex (available from
   825	the shareware/freeware sources listed above), Omega Point/2 (BBS tel.
   826	404-564-1961), Magnum (tel. 818-706-9800, BBS tel. 818-706-9805), and
   827	Multi-Net (tel. 503-883-8099, BBS tel. 503-883-8197).
   828	
   829	------------------------------
   830	
   831	(22)	Can I use COM3 and COM4 in OS/2?
   832	
   833	COM3 and COM4 are supported on PS/2s without any additional effort.  On
   834	(E)ISA machines, some additions are required to CONFIG.SYS.  Using a
   835	text editor, include "(port number, base address, interrupt number)"
   836	parameters next to the COM.SYS and VCOM.SYS filenames.  One example:
   837		DEVICE=C:\OS2\COM.SYS (3,3E8,5) (4,2E8,3)
   838		DEVICE=C:\OS2\MDOS\VCOM.SYS (3,3E8,5) (4,2E8,3)
   839	You do not have to include parameters for COM1 and COM2 (unless they are
   840	somehow nonstandard).
   841	
   842	Note that AT bus COM ports cannot be used at the same time if they share
   843	interrupts because of bus design limitations (cf. Roger C. Alford,
   844	"Under the Hood: How Interrupts Work," Byte, February, 1992, pp. 249-
   845	256).  PolyCom, a replacement driver available from the OS/2
   846	shareware/freeware sources (see Question 9), supports up to eight ports
   847	with the right hardware.
   848	
   849	"Smart" (coprocessor controlled) multiport communication adapters should
   850	be used when installing more than four ports.  Such an adapter will work
   851	with OS/2 if the manufacturer has written an appropriate driver.
   852	Examples include IBM's ARTIC products, Digitalk (tel. 213-645-1082) and
   853	Stargate (tel. 800-782-7428) adapters.
   854	
   855	------------------------------
   856	
   857	(23)	How do I start a background process from the OS/2 command line?
   858	
   859	Look up the START and DETACH commands in the online Command Reference.
   860	
   861	------------------------------
   862	
   863	(24)	What are CSDs, how do I tell which I have, and where do I get
   864		them?
   865	
   866	CSDs are Corrective Service Diskettes, or bug fixes, periodically issued
   867	by IBM.  The OS/2 CSD level number may be obtained using the command
   868	SYSLEVEL from the OS/2 command line prompt.  CSDs are cumulative, i.e.
   869	only the most recent CSD is required to bring a system up from any
   870	previous CSD level.  However, CSDs only apply within a major version
   871	number.  For example, an upgrade, not a CSD, would bring OS/2 Version
   872	1.3 up to Version 2.0.  Note also that each national language (e.g.
   873	French, U.K. English) uses a distinct CSD.
   874	
   875	CSDs may be ordered by anyone with an IBM customer number (usually large
   876	sites) directly from IBM Defect Support (tel. 800-237-5511).  OS/2 users
   877	without customer numbers should ask authorized IBM dealers to order CSDs
   878	from that source.  Many dealers do not know about this program, so be
   879	persistent.  CSDs may also be downloaded from the IBM NSC BBS,
   880	CompuServe ("GO IBMOS2"), or from other OS/2 shareware/freeware sources
   881	(see Question 9).  And CSDs may be ordered through IBM's new OS/2 BBS.
   882	
   883	The most recent OS/2 2.0 CSD level will be listed in this List and in
   884	the PS/2 Assistant files.
   885	
   886	------------------------------
   887	
   888	(25)	How do I add new Adobe Type Manager typefaces?
   889	
   890	OS/2 2.0 comes with built-in Adobe Type Manager for OS/2 and Win-OS/2.
   891	A basic set of typefaces comes with OS/2 2.0 and is installed for use
   892	under OS/2's ATM.  To install these same typefaces for use under Win-
   893	OS/2's ATM, go to the Win-OS/2 ATM Control Panel and install the
   894	typefaces from Printer Diskette 5.
   895	
   896	Each typeface should come with three separate files with PFB, AFM, and
   897	PFM extensions.  To install a typeface for use under Win-OS/2, use the
   898	ATM Control Panel.  To install a typeface for use with OS/2-specific
   899	applications, select OS/2 System -> System Setup -> Font Palette -> Edit
   900	Font... -> Add.
   901	
   902	PFM files may converted to AFM files using the PFM2AFM utility,
   903	available from many OS/2 shareware/freeware sources (see Question 9).
   904	Also, AFM files for Adobe commercial typefaces can be obtained via
   905	netmail; send a single line message with the word HELP to ps-file-
   906	server@adobe.com for instructions.
   907	
   908	With the exception of the basic set of typefaces that comes with OS/2
   909	2.0, typeface files may be shared by OS/2 ATM and Win-OS/2 ATM.  To do
   910	so, install the typefaces to a directory listed in LIBPATH in CONFIG.SYS
   911	(most conveniently \OS2\DLL).
   912	
   913	------------------------------
   914	
   915	(26)	How do I tweak OS/2 2.0 for maximum performance?
   916	
   917	For OS/2 overall, the parameters MAXWAIT, TIMESLICE, PRIORITY,
   918	PRIORITY_DISK_IO, and cache settings (in the DISKCACHE and/or IFS lines)
   919	can be tweaked.  These parameters are documented in the online Command
   920	Reference.
   921	
   922	If not using HPFS (which should only be used on systems with more than 6
   923	MB of RAM), periodically defragment FAT partitions using an appropriate
   924	utility.  A shareware defragmenter for DOS called DOG (Disk OrGanizer)
   925	works well.  (You can boot DOS from a floppy disk to run such a
   926	utility.)
   927	
   928	For the Workplace Shell, drag shadows of most often used items to the
   929	desktop or folders closer to the "surface" -- opening folders takes
   930	time.  Drag shadows of programs you use often (e.g. the Win-OS/2 full
   931	screen Program Manager) to the Startup folder.  Disable animation (go to
   932	OS/2 System -> System Setup -> System -> Window).
   933	
   934	For DOS programs, run full screen instead of windowed if speed is
   935	important.  In DOS Settings for each application: reduce conventional,
   936	XMS, DPMI, and EMS memory allocations to the bare minimum required for
   937	maximum performance; turn off VIDEO_RETRACE_EMULATION unless necessary;
   938	adjust IDLE_SENSITIVITY; turn off DOS_BACKGROUND_EXECUTION if not
   939	needed; change the HW_TIMER setting (particularly for games); enable
   940	VIDEO_FASTPASTE if possible.  Communications programs should use
   941	hardware handshaking where possible (use OS/2's MODE COMx command if
   942	necessary), and a buffered UART can prove helpful.  For faster printing
   943	set the DOS program's output port to LPTx.OS2 (where x is the printer
   944	port number) -- use a "print to file" option if necessary.  Other,
   945	standard steps to enhance DOS performance (e.g. increasing BUFFERS in
   946	CONFIG.SYS) of course apply.
   947	
   948	For Windows programs, run using a full screen desktop if speed is vital.
   949	The Win-OS/2 Full Screen icon set up by the installation program has
   950	poor Settings.  For better performance perform some of the same steps
   951	outlined in the preceding paragraph.  The same advice applies for
   952	printer output.  In addition, the Print Manager should be disabled (OS/2
   953	provides a systemwide spooler).  From the Win-OS/2 desktop close the
   954	Print Manager, uncheck the "Use Print Manager" box from the Win-OS/2
   955	Control Panel -> Printers section, then, using a text editor, edit the
   956	\OS2\MDOS\WINOS2\SYSTEM.INI file, removing the ",!printman" entry from
   957	the MAVDMApps line.  (This last step will keep a warning dialog box from
   958	appearing each time you start the Win-OS/2 desktop.)  Consider disabling
   959	the Public setting in the Clipboard.
   960	
   961	Try reducing the number of on screen colors or dropping down in screen
   962	resolution to enhance speed.  Close (not just minimize; check the Window
   963	List) unnecessary objects and applications.  Consider adding more RAM.
   964	
   965	Shadow RAM should be disabled (using your system's CMOS setup program)
   966	for best performance unless that RAM is not released by the system for
   967	use by OS/2.
   968	
   969	------------------------------
   970	
   971	(27)	What networking products are available for OS/2 2.0?
   972	
   973	In addition to DOS/Windows products, OS/2-specific TCP/IP support is
   974	available from IBM, Essex Systems (tel. 508-532-5511), FTP Software
   975	(send netmail to info@ftp.com), and others.  NetWare Requester for OS/2
   976	is available from Novell; NetWare server has been demonstrated by IBM.
   977	IBM offers both NetWare and LAN Server 2.0 (basic and advanced) with LAN
   978	Requesters.  Microsoft offers LAN Manager 2.1 (which comes bundled with
   979	OS/2 1.3) and is working on an OS/2 2.0-specific network requester.  DEC
   980	sells Pathworks for OS/2.  [Banyan Vines?  Others?]
   981	
   982	------------------------------
   983	
   984	(28)	Should I worry about viruses when running OS/2 2.0?
   985	
   986	At present there are no OS/2-specific viruses.  However, DOS/Windows
   987	viruses can conceivably infect an OS/2 2.0 system.  DOS/Windows
   988	antivirus tools are just as useful in preventing such infection.  Also,
   989	IBM has an antivirus package which runs under OS/2 directly (without
   990	DOS/Windows emulation), and others are on the way.
   991	
   992	But OS/2 2.0 is likely to be much more resistant to viruses because of
   993	its design.  Viruses running in one virtual DOS/Windows session are
   994	likely to be confined to that session.  Low level disk access is
   995	curtailed under OS/2 2.0, thus preventing most virus infection at that
   996	level.  And when a DOS/Windows virus does trigger, it is far less likely
   997	to disrupt the entire system.
   998	
   999	OS/2 2.0 is by no means virus proof -- no system is.  But it should
  1000	prove more resistant to virus infection.
  1001	
  1002	------------------------------
  1003	
  1004	(29)	Are there any clever tricks that apply to OS/2 2.0?
  1005	
  1006	If you have installed the optional bitmaps, try clicking on the
  1007	Workplace Shell desktop background once with mouse button one and
  1008	pressing CTRL-ALT-SHIFT-O.
  1009	
  1010	If you have a color monitor, try editing your CONFIG.SYS file so that
  1011		SET PROMPT=$e[32;40m$e[1m[$P]$e[0m
  1012	to obtain a more colorful OS/2 command line prompt.  You can do the same
  1013	for your DOS sessions if you edit PROMPT in AUTOEXEC.BAT, assuming you
  1014	have ANSI.SYS loaded.
  1015	
  1016	To force DIR to display your directories in alphabetical order, with the
  1017	subdirectories listed first, edit CONFIG.SYS so that
  1018		SET DIRCMD=/O:GN
  1019	and, if you wish the same for your DOS command line sessions, use DOSKEY
  1020	in AUTOEXEC.BAT (see the online Command Reference).  DOSKEY also enables
  1021	command history.  (Shutdown and reboot for changes to CONFIG.SYS to take
  1022	effect.)
