     5	          GIF files can be viewed on many different types of personal
     6	     computers. These machines have programs available which allow
     7	     for the viewing and conversion of GIF:

    12	               Commodore Amiga
    13	               IBM PC,XT,AT, PS/2 & Compatables

    19	          The image you send us is digitized into the GIF format
    20	     of your choice.  The resultant digitized images view quite well on
    21	     all these computers. Apple ][ and Hercules have no color of course,
    22	     and IBM CGA has only four colors.  But remember that only MS-DOS
    23	     computers can take advantage of this offer as we do not have
    24	     computers other than MS-DOS machines.  The GIF image is universal
    25	     but if you can't read the MS-DOS formated diskette then we can not
    26	     help you.... unless you make some arrangements with your sysop to
    27	     download the digitized images.  However, this would cost you about
    28	     three times the stardard price.

    30	          Our digitized photographs are available in the following
    31	     formats: (you make the choice on how you want them digitized.
