    10	Stacker's SCHECK utility offers information on the physical and logical
    11	Stacker drive regarding total, used, and remaining bytes; percentage of
    12	space used and free; compression ratio and projected bytes free.  Below
    13	is a typical SCHECK report:
    14	
    15	SCHECK - 2.0, (c) Copyright 1990-92 Stac Electronics, Carlsbad, CA
    16	Volume in drive E is STACVOL_DSK
    17	No errors found
    18	Stacker Drive Statistics:

    20	                  Stacker Drive             STACVOL File
    21	                  Drive E:                  E:\STACVOL.DSK
    22	            ----------------------          ----------------------
    23	  Total Bytes:  4,096,000                   2,054,656
    24	  Bytes Used:   3,735,552 ( 91.2%)          1,846,272 ( 89.9%)
    25	  Bytes Free:     360,448 (  8.8%)            208,384 ( 10.1%)
    26	
    27	Stacker Drive Compression Ratio = 2.0:1
    28	Projected Bytes Free            = 360,448

    31	What does it all mean?
    32	
    33	The left hand column displays logical data on the Stacker drive.  This
    34	is how DOS and CHKDSK see the drive.  The right hand column shows the
    35	usage of space (physical) inside the STACVOL file.  This is the file
    36	that contains all of your compressed data.  Its name and location are
    37	shown in the column title.
    38	
    39	Compression ratio:
    40	The Stacker drive compression ratio is the average compression ratio
    41	of the files in that specific STACKER drive.  In the above example, the
    42	2.0:1 ratio tells us that the files in this Stacker drive are taking up
    43	half the space they would take up on non "Stacked" drive.  The drive
    44	compression ratio does not display if the drive is empty.
    45	
    46	Projected bytes free:
    47	This number is Stacker's estimate of the available space left on the
    48	drive.  If the drive is less than 12% full, or if the drive compression
    49	ratio is 2.0:1 or greater, this number will be the same as bytes free
    50	in the Stacker drive (left column).  The projected bytes free on drives
    51	with usage over 12%, or compression ratios less than 2.0:1, will be a
    52	number slightly less than the bytes free in the STACVOL file multiplied
    53	by the overall compression ratio.
