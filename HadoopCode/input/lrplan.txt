     2	Taken from the public information file LONG_RANGE_PLAN.DOC on the University
     3	of Pittsburgh's VAX Cluster system.  This document details PITT's long range
     4	plan in regards to computing at the University of Pittsburgh.  Of special note
     5	are the references to Virtual Reality, as it could be used within the Academic
     6	environment.

    12	>in a longer view than five years, but well within existing technology,
    13	>digitized sound together with the availability of digital audio tape decks
    14	>should make possible compendiums of sound archives of everything from tribal
    15	>music to bird calls to sound effects to language dialects to speech therapy
    16	>analysis.
    17	
    18	>With the adoption of digital high-resolution television standards within
    19	>the next few years, film and video clips and stills should eventually become
    20	>available in digital form.  This will open extraordinary opportunities in
    21	>education.  Imagine a lecture that intersperses brief clips from Nova or
    22	>Infinite Voyage television archives to help illustrate difficult concepts in
    23	>a science class, or a lecture on Shakespeare that compares elements of
    24	>style with clips from several of his plays.  Or the introduction of
    25	>"virtual realities" into the classroom, in which field trips may be taken
    26	>that are either impractical or impossible in ordinary reality.
    27	
    28	>These are only a very few of the possibilities.  We predict that the next
    29	>ten years will see a genuine revolution in the way information is
    30	>accessed in our society due to the accessibility of networked distributed
    31	>databases.
    32	
    33	>Fortunately, the University of Pittsburgh is in an advantageous position
    34	>to capitalize on these developments as they occur.  The presence of
    35	>high-speed fiber-optic backbone network trunk lines, coupled with
    36	>ethernet port capabilities in most campus buildings, provides us with the
    37	>minimum essential connectivity needed to take advantage of the developing
    38	>networking capabilities.

    43	On the subject of whether or not a faculty member's personal computer would be
    44	the responsibilty of the faculty or department:
    45	
    46	>Another example:  A physics lab might be constructed around a "virtual
    47	>reality" in which all frictional forces are absent and the gravity field
    48	>may be changed at will.  While the individual student machines may reside
    49	>in a physics laboratory room, the actual computing power may well reside
    50	>elsewhere (or even in several places) on the network.  Or the physics lab
    51	>may be carried out on any suitable machine connected to the network,
    52	>either in a public computing lab or even in a student's dorm room!  How
    53	>much of the physics lab is "central", and how much is the responsibility
    54	>of the "end-user"?

    63	>environment, such as in a flight simulator.
