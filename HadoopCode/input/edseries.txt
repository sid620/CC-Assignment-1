     2	    The recent addition of several new CCITT standards has caused
     3	confusion in the field of data communications.  The V.32, V.22bis
     4	and V.42bis protocols sound like they are related, but they are
     5	not.  V.32 and V.22bis are modulation techniques, which control
     6	the physical transfer of data between two modems.  V.32 defines
     7	the modulation technique at 9600 bps while V.22bis defines 2400
     8	bps modulation.  Modulation/demodulation (modem) is simply the
     9	process of changing digital bits of information in your computer
    10	to analog tones for use on phone lines and vice versa.
    11	
    12	     V.42bis and MNP-5, on the other hand, are rival hardware-
    13	based protocols that handle error correction and data
    14	compression.  Their correction components check for errors,
    15	retransmitting data if necessary. The compression algorithm
    16	boosts transmission speed by assigning symbols to common words in
    17	the file and transferring the symbol instead of the actual word.
    18	
    19	     The Ven-Tel 9600 Plus will attempt to connect at V.32
    20	transfer level and then negotiate down to V.22bis.  (Without V.32
    21	capabilities, 9600 bps modems are limited to 2400 bps transfers
    22	between different modem manufacturers).  Ven-Tel's 9600 Plus will
    23	communicate with other manufacturer's V.32 modems and can
    24	reliably swap data at 9600 bps when using the same software-based
    25	error-correction protocol, such as Xmodem.  However, if the 9600
    26	Plus connects to a V.32 modem that is using the same hardware-
    27	based correction/compression protocol (V.42bis or MNP-5) it can
    28	achieve even higher speeds, often beyond 38,000 bps.
    29	
    30	     V.32 modems are particularly fast because they provide full-
    31	duplex (two-way) communications.  By sending and receiving data
    32	simultaneously, one modem can return error-checking data while
    33	the other sends a file. Ven-Tel's 9600 Plus modem uses echo
    34	cancellation technology to keep the two signals distinct.  By
    35	subtracting its own signal from the jumble, a modem can
    36	distinguish incoming data.
    37	
    38	     The Ven-Tel 9600 Plus also uses Trellis encoding, which
    39	corrects most errors caused by noisy phone lines.  Trellis
    40	encoding is called a forward error correction because the
    41	receiving modem can fix most errors without a retransmission.
    42	This leaves less error-correcting work for the V.42bis or MNP-5,
    43	resulting in faster throughput.
    44	
    45	     Although error correction can slow transfers on dirty lines,
    46	both protocols use an efficient synchronous framing technique
    47	that speeds transfers by 20 percent on average lines.  MNP-5
    48	compression can double the throughput, and the new V.42bis
    49	compression can even triple throughput.
    50	
    51	     V.42 and MNP-5 are compatible only at the correction level,
    52	not on the compression level.  By definition V.42 compliance
    53	incorporates MNP-4 and LAP-M error correction protocols.  V.42
    54	compatibility is defined as having either MNP or LAP-M.  Ven-Tel
    55	manufactures a complete line of modems that are V.42 compatible
    56	(MNP-5) at 2400 bps, including PS/2, standard bus, Macintosh and
    57	external models.  The Ven-Tel 9600 Plus and 9600 Plus II are both
    58	V.32 and V.42bis compatible and carry a five year warranty.
