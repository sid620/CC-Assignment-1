     1	A LOW COST PERFORMANCE BOOST FOR YOUR 386 PC
     2	
     3	If you own a 386 based PC, you may be a little envious of the owners of all
     4	these speedy new 486 based PCs. I know that I was. I say WAS because I
     5	now get 486 class performance out of my old 386 system and I did not
     6	spend a fortune. If you have a 386 system you may also be interested in
     7	this upgrade.

     9	THE Cx486DLC
    10	
    11	Introduced in the summer of 1992, Cyrix produces a processor called the
    12	Cx486DLC.  The Cx486DLC is a cross between Intel's 386DX and 486SX.  The
    13	Cx486DLC is pin compatible with the 386DX and instruction set compatible
    14	with the 486SX.  Like the 486SX the Cx486DLC contains an internal cache
    15	and an optimized execution unit.  The cache and optimized execution unit
    16	are the main reasons that a 486 is faster then a 386 at the same clock
    17	rate. By replacing your 386 CPU with the Cx486DLC you get 486 class
    18	performance without replacing your PC.
    19	
    20	To be sure that your PC is upgradable to the Cx486DLC, check through the
    21	following:
    22	
    23	1 - The PC must be based on a 386DX (sometimes called a 386 or 80386)
    24	from Intel or AMD.  PCs based on the 386SX can not use this upgrade. 
    25	
    26	2 - Remove the cover of your PC and locate the CPU.  It is a 1.5 inch
    27	square IC.  It should be labeled Intel or AMD 386DX.  There must be
    28	about 2 inches of open space above the CPU.  The Cx486DLC runs hotter
    29	than the 386DX and typically requires a heat sink mounted on top of the
    30	chip. The additional space is required by the heat sink.
    31	
    32	3 - You should have a socket on the motherboard for a 387 math
    33	co-processor. You may have a 387 already installed.
    34	
    35	If your PC meets all of the above requirements you can perform the
    36	upgrade.  I checked around for the best prices on the Cyrix chips and
    37	found that CompuAdd express offers the best deal.  They sell upgrade
    38	kits for their line of scalable PCs.  Each upgrade kit includes the
    39	Cx486DLC, a Cyrix math co-processor, the heat sink and a chip puller for
    40	removing the old 386 CPU.  While they are intended for use with
    41	CompuAdd's line of PCs, they are ideal for our upgrade and are quite a
    42	bargain.  At the time I'm writing this, the price of a 33 Mhz upgrade
    43	kit has just dropped to $159 and a 40 Mhz kit has dropped to $249.  A
    44	math co-processor alone costs about $100.  The upgrade kit to order if
    45	your PC runs at 33 Mhz or slower is the 433DLC.  The 40 Mhz kit is the
    46	440DLC. 
    47	
    48	PERFORMING THE UPGRADE
    49	
    50	Remove the cover from your PC, locate the 386 CPU.  Note the location of
    51	pin 1 on the CPU.  Pin 1 is marked by a dot or cut off corner on the
    52	chip.  Use the chip puller to carefully pry the CPU out of it's socket. 
    53	Work slowly around the chip as to not bend any of the pins.  Place the
    54	486DLC into the socket with pin 1 in the same orientation as before. 
    55	Carefully press the chip into the socket.  Once the chip is in place,
    56	power on the PC, it should beep and power up normally.  Power down the
    57	PC, install the heat sink on top of the Cx486DLC and install the math
    58	co-processor as instructed in the manual for the PC (you may need to
    59	move a jumper in addition to installing the chip).  Replace the cover
    60	and you are ready to go.  The PC should now run normally.  To get the
    61	full speed increase you will also need a program that activates the
    62	Cx486DLC's cache.  I've written such a program, called CYINIT.  You
    63	download a copy of CYINIT (in the archive 386486.ZIP) from both
    64	Compuserve or Genie.  It is in the IBMAPP section on Compuserve and in
    65	Don Lancaster's PSRT on Genie.  If would like a copy on disk, I will
    66	provide one if you send me a check for $10.00.  Once the system is up
    67	and running add CYINIT to your autoexec.bat file.  That way the cache
    68	will automatically be activated when you start your PC. 
    69	
    70	THE PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT
    71	
    72	I've upgraded several systems and found that the CPU performance
    73	typically improves about 50%. Figure 1 shows the typical improvement
    74	shown in the ZD Labs benchmark tests. The system upgraded was a 33 Mhz
    75	386DX with a 64 K external cache and an Intel 387 math coprocessor (also
    76	called an FPU - Floating Point Unit). The performance improvement varied
    77	with the different tests, but averaged out to about a 50 % improvement.
    78	The FPU test also showed that the Cyrix math coprocessor offered a large
    79	speed gain over the Intel math coprocessor. Figure 2 compares the
    80	performance of a 33 Mhz 386, a 33 Mhz Cx486DLC, a 33 Mhz 486DX, a 40 Mhz
    81	Cx486DLC and a 66 Mhz 486DX2 running the 386 instruction mix from the ZD
    82	Labs benchmark. As it shows the 486DLC gives 486 class performance to
    83	your old 386 PC at a bargain price.

    91	In my article on upgrading your 386 PC to a 486. I recommended CompuAdd
    92	Express as the best place to purchase the upgrade. Just recently
    93	CompuAdd has shutdown the Express division and the upgrade kit is no
    94	longer available from them. In scanning through the Computer Shopper I
    95	have found the following list of vendors that sell the Cyrix CPUs ( I
    96	have have not dealt with any of these outfits so these are not
    97	endorsements on my part):
    98	
    99	Buffalo Products	1-800-345-2356

   106	
   107	PC Importers		1-800-886-5155

   109	In addition the Cyrix distributors are:
   110	
   111	Bell Micro Pro		1-800-955-1999
   112	
   113	Bell Industries		1-800-BUY-BELL
   114	
   115	I hope that these numbers could be published in the next edition to aid
   116	those looking to upgrade.
