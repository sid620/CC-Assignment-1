     5	NOVEMBER 13, 1995 - Las Vegas, Nev. - ATI Technologies Inc. (TSE:ATY) today
     6	announced 3D RAGE, the first 3D chip that meets the price/performance
     7	milestones set by manufacturers of the next generation of Multimedia Home
     8	PCs and provides a comprehensive 3D arcade-caliber tool kit for games
     9	developers to create visually stunning games on the PC.
    10	
    11	Value-priced, and featuring dizzying arcade-caliber gaming on the PC, 3D
    12	RAGE is the most integrated high performance multimedia accelerator in its
    13	class. 3D RAGE marries rich 3D features with all of the capabilities of its
    14	award winning mach64 2D accelerators, adds full-screen, full-motion 30
    15	frames per second (fps) MPEG video playback and enhanced support for all
    16	major consumer video applications to produce the most intense gaming
    17	experience available on a PC. The new chip also utilizes the latest SGRAM
    18	memory providing four times the performance of current DRAM products at
    19	DRAM comparable pricing. Next generation synchronous memories keep
    20	bandwidth-hungry video and 3D engines found in advanced multimedia
    21	accelerators running smoothly.
    22	
    23	"With 3D RAGE, ATI completes the PC gaming puzzle," said Henry Quan, ATI's
    24	vice president of marketing. "Capitalizing on proven technologies and
    25	stable, open platforms, we have brought together the best of 3D, 2D and
    26	video, all in one product, which will not only produce the most powerful
    27	experience for the hard core gamer but will provide the ultimate, maximized
    28	tool for games developers."
    29	
    30	"After years of anticipation, everything will finally be in place over the
    31	next 12 months to foster a leap forward for the PC viewing experience,"
    32	said Mike Feibus, Analyst with Mercury Research. "This is due primarily to
    33	the confluence of three factors. First and foremost is Windows 95, with
    34	open and available APIs. Second is the emergence of accelerators like ATI's
    35	3D RAGE that provide support for 3D and video as well as two-dimensional
    36	graphics. And third, the developing hardware-software platform is spurring
    37	games developers to make use of the technology. It will be an exciting
    38	year."
    39	
    40	"Companies like Microsoft and ATI are leading the industry to transform the
    41	PC into the ultimate gaming platform," said Kate Seekings, Microsoft's 3D
    42	Evangelist. "With the introduction of 3D RAGE, ATI has once again shown
    43	that they understand the needs of games developers and systems
    44	manufacturers and have built in all the features and performance these two
    45	parties need to capitalize on this huge business opportunity."
    46	
    47	Built for Current and Future Needs
    48	
    49	Priced at $48 (in quantities of l0,000), with samples available now and
    50	full production to begin in first quarter 1996, 3D RAGE is the first chip
    51	of its kind which will enable systems manufacturers to provide completely
    52	integrated, high performance 2D/3D/video for arcade-caliber gaming in an
    53	easily upgradeable multimedia system which could sell for less than $2,000.
    54	The second in its accelerator family to incorporate ATI's recently
    55	announced Enhanced Visual Architecture (EVA), 3D RAGE allows OEMs to design
    56	a single low-cost multimedia motherboard which incorporates the critical
    57	features the new multimedia consumer is demanding such as TV-tuner,
    58	hardware MPEG and video conferencing.
    59	
    60	The PC - An Inherently Superior Gaming Machine
    61	
    62	With industry experts predicting sales volumes of "next generation"
    63	multimedia PCs at over 10 million units in l996, the revenue potential for
    64	PC games is far greater than that of "next generation" games consoles. As
    65	well as providing the virtual reality experience of 3D, the PC as a gaming
    66	platform supports TV-quality video, interactivity for tele-gaming and
    67	LAN-based multi-player gaming, making it an inherently superior gaming
    68	environment, virtually unmatchable in the console market. Games developers
    69	need a predictable, stable, high performance platform to ensure that PC
    70	games can be created that will be a significant improvement over the
    71	console experience. ATI's 3D RAGE has been built to meet these criteria and
    72	with an installed base of over l0 million accelerators, ATI is a proven
    73	volume supplier of multimedia hardware and can deliver the customers for
    74	games publishers to support the development of 3D games on the PC.
    75	
    76	Rather than catering to a proprietary, closed environment like some other
    77	multimedia accelerator vendors, ATI's 3D RAGE leverages off the strong
    78	industry standards being developed by companies like Microsoft. It supports
    79	all major Application Programming Interfaces (API) including Microsoft's
    80	Windows 95 Direct3D and Reality Lab, Apple's TinselTown and QuickDraw 3D,
    81	Argonaut's BRender and Criterion's RenderWare. Coupled with the latest
    82	gaming add-ons such as joysticks, 3D input devices, Virtual Reality
    83	headsets and Digital Simultaneous Voice Data (DSVD) modems used for
    84	tele-gaming, 3D RAGE will enable totally new gaming categories.
    85	
    86	The Ideal Development Tool
    87	
    88	"While other graphics and video vendors continue to launch 'trade-off
    89	technology', ATI's 3D RAGE supports all major APIs, accelerates all six
    90	Direct 3D texturing modes and incorporates all the features a games
    91	developer needs to optimize the gaming experience," said Craig Fryar from
    92	the OEM division of game publisher Interplay Productions. "Put this amazing
    93	product together with ATI's reputation for shipping quality multimedia
    94	hardware in volume and games developers have a winner."
    95	
    96	With performance rates of over 20 million perspectively correct texture
    97	mapped pixels per second and 575K+ Gouraud shaded triangles per second, 3D
    98	RAGE has the best single chip performance currently available in this
    99	category. To achieve comparable functionality and performance, other
   100	vendors require the use of multiple chips like triangle set-up engines and
   101	DACs, which adds to total system costs. Also, many chip manufacturers
   102	provide limited features forcing the game developer to compromise image
   103	quality in favor of speed, or vice versa. ATI allows the games developers'
   104	creativity to reign supreme by allowing them to decide how they want to use
   105	3D RAGE features to create the ultimate experience depending on the class
   106	of game they are developing.
   107	
   108	By utilizing PCI bus mastering, 3D RAGE further increases system
   109	performance. For example, texture maps can be swapped at high speeds
   110	between system and graphics memory which offloads the CPU to perform tasks
   111	such as calculating triangle vertices, resulting in significantly higher
   112	frame rates, which provides a dramatically enhanced gaming experience.
   113	
   114	3D Rage supports perspectively-corrected bi- and tri-linear filtered
   115	texture mapping for the highest level of virtual reality immersion. In
   116	addition, support for all six Direct 3D modes in conjunction with sub-pixel
   117	accuracy creates an amazing gaming experience. It also supports 3D Gouraud
   118	shaded polygons to accelerate the rendering of solid color surfaces. Hidden
   119	surface removal using Z-buffering is also available so the developer can
   120	decide whether to use graphics memory to offload the CPU from having to
   121	perform the taxing Z-sort algorithm when building 3D images.
   122	
   123	Ardent gamers are truly addicted to eye-popping 3D which games developers
   124	achieve using special effects, such as alpha blending, fog and texture
   125	lighting, which have all been incorporated into 3D RAGE. With the video
   126	texturing feature of 3D RAGE, developers can render live video images
   127	direct from an MPEG source onto 3D surfaces for state-of-the-art visual
   128	effects.
   129	
   130	The Ultimate Video Accelerator
   131	
   132	3D RAGE provides the highest possible video functionality including support
   133	for all major consumer video applications. MPEG playback functionality
   134	provides broadcast-quality, full screen, full motion, true color video. To
   135	transform your PC into an intelligent TV that harnesses all of the
   136	entertainment capabilities of a TV with the processing power of a PC, a
   137	TV-tuner capability can be added on so users can channel surf, do instant
   138	replays, capture their own TV transcripts and more. An optional hardware
   139	MPEG upgrade will provide the highest quality video images at full screen,
   140	30 fps speeds guaranteed, completely removing the task of processing video
   141	from the CPU. Enabling all of this multimedia expansion is ATI's EVA
   142	architecture with its built-in ATI Media Connector (AMC) which allows for
   143	the efficient transport of video and audio between multimedia devices and
   144	cards.
   145	
   146	ATI is the first to include both front-end and back-end video hardware
   147	scaling to handle two or more video streams simultaneously, a key
   148	requirement for the burgeoning modem-based video conferencing market. PCI
   149	bus mastering offloads the CPU from bi-directional transfer of video
   150	between the system memory and the accelerator.
   151	
   152	3D RAGE - The Ideal OEM Product
   153	
   154	ATI clearly has an advantage over the several new entrants who have
   155	appeared in the 3D acceleration market. OEMs are building Home PCs for
   156	users who are not only demanding great 3D, 2D and video acceleration, but
   157	who also want proven feature rich drivers and utilities. In addition, OEM
   158	system manufacturers are selling into a multiple niche market where
   159	TV-tuners, hardware MPEG and videoconferencing are in high demand. 3D RAGE
   160	provides all of this functionality plus ensures pin compatibility with
   161	current and future mach64 multimedia accelerators and options provides
   162	local language support to lessen the cost for the OEM to sell the product
   163	in international markets.
