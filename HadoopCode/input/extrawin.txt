     1	NETWORLD Boston. Mass: Attachmate today unveiled its Host Graphics Option
     2	(HGO) for Windows, which allows PCs running Microsoft Windows to emulate
     3	the functions of an IBM 3179-G mainframe Graphics terminal. The new
     4	product is an add-on option to the company's EXTRA! for Windows
     5	PC-mainframe software, and is slated for shipment later this month.
     6	
     7	"HGO for Windows overcomes the problems associated with using a PC to do
     8	mainframe graphics," said Mike New, VP of marketing for Attachmate.
     9	"3179-G emulation is one of the most complicated, detail-oriented aspects
    10	of PC-mainframe software. The first 80% is relatively easy to develop, but
    11	the last 20% is critical to proper operation. We've devoted the time and
    12	effort to do accurate 3179-G emulation and ensure full compatibility with
    13	host applications."
    14	
    15	An incomplete implementation of the 3179-G protocol can either present
    16	erroneous information or completely hang the host session. Accurate image
    17	display and fully interactive manipulation are essential. Most
    18	importantly, accurate 3179-G emulation ensures stability. IBM's mainframe
    19	graphics package, Application System (AS), for example, occasionally
    20	invokes a little-used "text cursor" mode of the 3179-G terminal.
    21	Attachmate's HGO product is fully compatible with AS. Products that do not
    22	implement text cursor do not run reliably with AS.
    23	
    24	Some mainframe graphics applications are more forgiving. IBM's Graphical
    25	Data Display Manager (GDDM), for example, allows PC-based emulators to
    26	tell the host which 3179-G functions they support. "In our experience,
    27	however, most host graphics applications are hardcoded for a real 3179-G
    28	terminal and produce unpredictable results if some terminal functions are
    29	missing," said New. Attachmate's HGO for Windows responds to mainframe
    30	commands as if it were a real 3179-G terminal, ensuring compatibility with
    31	any host graphics application.
    32	
    33	Accurate Image Display
    34	
    35	HGO takes full advantage of the Windows environment by dynamically resizing
    36	the host image to fit the window. Since the image may become distorted as
    37	the window is stretched, however, the product includes an option that
    38	preserves the correct aspect ratio for a given window size. This feature
    39	is important for host images such as surface charts that could be
    40	misinterpreted if distorted.
    41	
    42	Downloadable symbols are also fully supported, again ensuring the accuracy
    43	of the host image. These custom symbol sets are often downloaded from the
    44	host for specialized functions, such as a pattern-fill for an object. The
    45	3179-G terminal supports both a default symbol set and the downloadable
    46	symbols that can significantly change an image. Most PC-based emulators
    47	support only the default set; HGO replicates the full 3179-G
    48	functionality.
    49	
    50	Interactive Image Manipulation
    51	
    52	Once HGO has displayed the image at the PC, the user has several options
    53	for manipulation. On-line editing is possible using HGO's graphic and text
    54	cursor ability . All four 3179-G graphic cursors are supported, again
    55	reflecting the complete set of terminal functions.
    56	
    57	Default mainframe colors can be individually re-assigned by the user to any
    58	color supported by the PC. On some PC monitors, for example, the default
    59	blue used with the actual 3179-G terminal may appear too dark. A user can
    60	change the color to their personal preference.
    61	
    62	Copy and Paste functions are also supported using the Windows clipboard,
    63	with an important distinction: Because HGO for Windows preserves the
    64	separate text and graphics "layers" as implemented in the 3179-G, the user
    65	may elect to copy/paste only the graphic image. The clutter of text
    66	prompts and menus on the mainframe screen can be omitted when the image is
    67	imported into other Windows applications.
    68	
    69	Mainframe images can be printed to any Windows-supported printer or
    70	plotter, and may include either the text or graphics layer, or both.
    71	Images may also be stored in a variety of popular formats, including PIF,
    72	Metafile and BX-mapped.
    73	
    74	Pricing and Availability
    75	
    76	HGO for Windows is available immediately from Attachmate. List price is
    77	$495; corporate discounts are available. Under Attachmate's EXTRA! for
