     1	  
     2	  Based  on  the committee's investigation and two  separate
     3	court  rulings,  it is clear that high level  Department  of
     4	Justice  officials deliberately ignored INSLAW's proprietary
     5	rights in the enhanced version of PROMIS and misappropriated
     6	this  software  for  use  at  locations  not  covered  under
     7	contract  with  the  company.  Justice  then  proceeded   to
     8	challenge INSLAW's claims in court even though it knew  that
     9	these  claims were valid and that the Department would  most
    10	likely lose in court on this issue. After almost 7 years  of
    11	litigation and $1 million in cost, the Department  is  still
    12	denying   its  culpability  in  this  matter.   Instead   of
    13	conducting  an  investigation  into  INSLAW's  claims   that
    14	criminal  wrongdoing by high level Government officials  had
    15	occurred, Attorney Generals Meese and Thornburgh blocked  or
    16	restricted congressional inquiries into the matter,  ignored
    17	the  findings  of  two courts and refused  to  ask  for  the
    18	appointment  of an independent counsel. These  actions  were
    19	taken in the face of a growing body of evidence that serious
    20	wrongdoing had occurred which reached to the highest  levels
    21	of  the  Department. The evidence received by the  committee
    22	during  its  investigation clearly raises  serious  concerns
    23	about  the possibility that a high level conspiracy  against
    24	INSLAW  did exist and that great efforts have been  expended
    25	by  the  Department to block any outside investigation  into
    26	the matter.
    27	  Based  on  the  evidence presented  in  this  report,  the
    28	committee believes that extraordinary steps are required  to
    29	resolve  the INSLAW issue. The Attorney General should  take
    30	immediate  steps  to  remunerate INSLAW  for  the  harm  the
    31	Department  has egregiously caused the company.  The  amount
    32	determined should include all reasonable legal expenses  and
    33	other  costs  to the Hamiltons not directly related  to  the
    34	contract  but caused by the actions taken by the  Department
    35	to  harm  the  company or its employees.  To  avoid  further
    36	retaliation against the company, the Attorney General should
    37	prohibit Department personnel who participated in any way in
    38	the litigation of the INSLAW matter from further involvement
    39	in  this  case. In the event that the Attorney General  does
    40	not  move  expeditiously to remunerate INSLAW, then Congress
    41	should   move  quickly  under  the  congressional  reference
    42	provisions of the Court of Claims Act to initiate  a  review
    43	of this matter by that court.
    44	  Finally,  the  committee believes that the  only  way  the
    45	INSLAW  allegations can be adequately and fully investigated
    46	is  by  the  appointment  of  an  independent  counsel.  The
    47	committee  is  aware  that  on  November  13,  1991,   newly
    48	confirmed  Attorney General Barr finally appointed  Nicholas
    49	Bua,  a  retired Federal judge from Chicago, as his  special
    50	counsel  to  investigate  and  advise  him  on  the   INSLAW
    51	controversy. However, at that time the Attorney General  had
    52	not  empowered  Judge Bua to subpoena witnesses,  convene  a
    53	grand   jury  or  compel  the  Department  to  produce   key
    54	documents.
    55	  INSLAW  officials  have voiced concerns  that  Judge  Bua,
    56	lacking  independent counsel status, would not  be  able  to
    57	entice  Department employees who were knowledgeable  of  the
    58	INSLAW  matter  to  come forward and  assist  Judge  Bua  in
    59	bringing  this  matter  to closure. Consequently,  they  are
    60	concerned     that     Judge     Bua     will     not     be
    61	able  to  get to the bottom of the matter, and they  believe
    62	his  investigation  will  end  up  being  subverted  by  the
    63	Department.
    64	  The  inability to subpoena and/or to convene a grand  jury
    65	was  apparently of concern to Judge Bua and, after a meeting
    66	on  January 28, 1992, the Attorney General granted Judge Bua
    67	broad  investigative authority which included the  power  to
    68	subpoena  witnesses  and to convene  special  grand  juries.
    69	However  because of the actions by the Department  regarding
    70	potential  whistleblowers such as Anthony  Pasciuto,  it  is
    71	very  likely  witnesses will still feel intimidated  by  the
    72	Department.   This  problem  was  present   throughout   the
    73	committee's  investigation and remains a  potential  problem
    74	today.
    75	  Without  independent counsel status, Judge Bua remains  an
    76	employee of the Department of Justice. The image problem  is
    77	illustrated  in  a  recent interview with Roger  M.  Cooper,
    78	Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Administration. In  an
    79	interview  with  the Government Computer  News,  Mr.  Cooper
    80	stated that:
    81	  
    82	      The  judge (Bua) will do as the attorney  general
    83	     wants  him to do, and that's fine. I think all  of
    84	     us  in  the department would like to get  it  [the
    85	     INSLAW  matter]  behind  us.  It's  sort   of   an
    86	     albatross.
    87	  
    88	  Mr.  Cooper  may  have  meant that Attorney  General  Barr
    89	wants  Judge  Bua  to conduct a thorough investigation.  The
    90	committee has no reason to doubt the commitment of Judge Bua
    91	or  Attorney General Barr to do a thorough investigation  of
    92	this matter-the problem rests with the fact that, as long as
    93	the  investigation of wrongdoing by former and current  high
    94	level  Justice  officials remains under the control  of  the
    95	Department,  there will always be serious  doubt  about  the
    96	objectivity and thoroughness of the work.
    97	  This  matter  has caused great harm to several individuals
    98	involved   and  has  severely  undermined  the  Department's
    99	credibility  and  reputation.  Congress  and  the  executive
   100	branch must take immediate and forceful steps to restore the
   101	public  confidence and faith in our system of justice  which
   102	has  been  severely eroded by this painful  and  unfortunate
   103	affair. As such, the independent counsel should be appointed
   104	with  full  and  broad  powers to  investigate  all  matters
   105	related  to  the  allegations of wrongdoing  in  the  INSLAW
   106	matter, including Mr. Casolaro's death and its possible link
   107	to individuals associated with organized crime.
   108	  
   109	                         X. FINDINGS
   110	  
   111	  1.   The   Department,  in  an  attempt  to  implement   a
   112	standardized  case  management system, ignored  advice  from
   113	vendors-including INSLAW-that PROMIS should not  be  adapted
   114	to  word processing equipment. As predicted, problems  arose
   115	with  adapting  PROMIS  to  word processing  equipment.  The
   116	Department immediately set out to terminate that portion  of
   117	the contract and blamed INSLAW for its failure.
   118	  2.  The  Department exhibited extremely poor  judgment  by
   119	assigning   C.   Madison  Brewer  to   manage   the   PROMIS
   120	implementation contract. Mr. Brewer had been asked to  leave
   121	his  position  as general counsel of INSLAW  under  strained
   122	relations   with  INSLAW's  owner,  Mr.  William   Hamilton.
   123	INSLAW's problems with the Department, which started  almost
   124	immediately      after      the      award      of       the
   125	contract  in  March 1982, were generated in  large  part  by
   126	Mr.  Brewer,  with the support and direction of  high  level
   127	Department officials. The potential conflict of interest  in
   128	the  hiring  of Mr. Brewer was not considered by  Department
   129	officials.  However, Mr. Brewer's past strained relationship
   130	with Mr. Hamilton, and the fact that he lacked experience in
   131	ADP  management  and  understanding of  Federal  procurement
   132	laws, raises serious questions about why he was selected  as
   133	the PROMIS project manager.
   134	  3.  Mr. Brewer's attitude toward INSLAW, combined with Mr.
   135	Videnieks'  harsh  contract philosophy,  led  to  the  rapid
   136	deterioration  of  relations  between  the  Department   and
   137	INSLAW.   Any  semblance  of  fairness  by  key   Department
   138	officials toward INSLAW quickly evaporated when Mr. Hamilton
   139	attempted to protect his companies' proprietary rights to  a
   140	privately funded enhanced version of the PROMIS software. In
   141	a  highly unusual move, Mr. Brewer recommended just 1  month
   142	after the contract was signed that INSLAW be terminated  for
   143	convenience  of  the  Government  even  though  INSLAW   was
   144	performing under the contract. From that point forward there
   145	is  no  indication  that Mr. Brewer or  Mr.  Videnieks  ever
   146	deviated  from their plan to harm INSLAW. The actions  taken
   147	by  Messrs.  Brewer and Videnieks were done  with  the  full
   148	knowledge and support of high level Department officials.
   149	  4.  Peter Videnieks, the Department's contracting officer,
   150	negotiated Modification 12 of the contract which resulted in
   151	INSLAW  agreeing to provide its proprietary Enhanced  PROMIS
   152	software  for  the  Department's use. This  negotiation  was
   153	conducted  in  bad  faith because Justice later  refused  to
   154	recognize  INSLAW's  rights  to  privately  financed  PROMIS
   155	enhancements.  Mr.  Videnieks and Mr. Brewer,  supported  by
   156	Deputy   Attorney  General  Jensen  and  other  high   level
   157	officials,  unilaterally concluded that the  Department  was
   158	not  bound  by  the property laws that applied to  privately
   159	developed and financed software.
   160	  6.   Thereafter,  the  Department  ignored  INSLAW's  data
   161	rights  to  its enhanced version of its PROMIS software  and
   162	misused  its  prosecutorial  and  litigative  resources   to
   163	legitimize  and  coverup  its  misdeeds.  This  resulted  in
   164	extremely  protracted litigation and  an  immense  waste  of
   165	resources both for the Government and INSLAW. These  actions
   166	were taken even though the Department had already determined
   167	that  INSLAW's  claim was probably justified  and  that  the
   168	Department  would  lose in court. In fact,  Deputy  Attorney
   169	General Burns acknowledged this fact to OPR investigators.
   170	  6.  Department  of Justice documents show that  a  "public
   171	domain"  version of the PROMIS software was sent to domestic
   172	and  international  entities  including  Israel.  Given  the
   173	Department's  position  regarding  its  ownership   of   all
   174	versions   of  PROMIS,  questions  remain  whether  INSLAW's
   175	Enhanced  PROMIS was distributed by Department officials  to
   176	numerous  sources outside the Department, including  foreign
   177	governments.
   178	  7.  Several  witnesses, including former Attorney  General
   179	Elliot Richardson, have provided testimony, sworn statements
   180	or  affidavits linking high level Department officials to  a
   181	conspiracy  to steal INSLAW's PROMIS software  and  secretly
   182	transfer  PROMIS to Dr. Brian. According to these witnesses,
   183	the  PROMIS software was subsequently converted for  use  by
   184	domestic          and          foreign          intelligence
   185	services.  This  testimony was provided by  individuals  who
   186	knew  that  the  Justice Department  would  be  inclined  to
   187	prosecute them for perjury if they lied under oath. No  such
   188	prosecutions have occurred.
   189	  8.  Justice  had made little effort to resolve conflicting
   190	and possibly perjurious sworn statements by key departmental
   191	witnesses about the alleged attempt by high level Department
   192	officials to liquidate INSLAW and steal its software. It  is
   193	very  possible  that  Judge  Blackshear  may  have  perjured
   194	himself  and even today his explanations for his recantation
   195	of  his  sworn  statement  provided  to  INSLAW  are  highly
   196	suspicious.  The  investigation  of  this  matter   by   the
   197	Department's  Office  of  Professional  Responsibility   was
   198	superficial.
   199	  9.  The  Department's  response to INSLAW's  requests  for
   200	investigations  by  an independent counsel  and  the  Public
   201	Integrity Section was cursory and incomplete
   202	  10.  The  reviews  of the INSLAW matter by  Congress  were
   203	hampered  by  Department tactics designed  to  conceal  many
   204	significant  documents  and  otherwise  interfere  with   an
   205	independent  review. The Department actions appear  to  have
   206	been  motivated more by an intense desire to  defend  itself
   207	from    INSLAW's   charges   of   misconduct   rather   than
   208	investigating possible violations of the law.
   209	  11.  Justice officials have asserted that, as a result  of
   210	the  recent  ruling by the Appeals Court and the refusal  of
   211	the  Supreme Court to hear INSLAW's appeal, the Findings and
   212	Conclusions  of  Bankruptcy Judge George  Bason  and  senior
   213	Judge  William  Bryant of the District Court are  no  longer
   214	relevant.  The  Appeals Court decision,  in  fact,  did  not
   215	dispute  the  Bankruptcy Court's ruling that the  Department
   216	"stole É through trickery, fraud and deceit" INSLAW's PROMIS
   217	software.  Its  decision was based primarily on  the  narrow
   218	question  of  whether the Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction;
   219	the Appeals Court ruled that it did not. This decision in no
   220	way  vindicates  the Department nor should  it  be  used  to
   221	insulate  Justice  from the criticism it deserves  over  the
   222	mishandling of the INSLAW contract.
   223	  12.  The  Justice Department continues to  improperly  use
   224	INSLAW's  proprietary software in blatant disregard  of  the
   225	findings  of  two courts and well established property  law.
   226	This   fact  coupled  with  the  general  lack  of  fairness
   227	exhibited  by  Justice officials throughout this  affair  is
   228	unbefitting  of  the  agency entrusted  with  enforcing  our
   229	Nation's laws.
   230	  13.   Further   investigation   into   the   circumstances
   231	surrounding Daniel Casolaro's death is needed.
   232	  14.   The  following  criminal  statutes  may  have   been
   233	violated by certain high level Justice officials and private
   234	individuals:
   235	  
   236	      18 U.S.C. ¤ 371-Conspiracy to commit an offense.
   237	      18 U.S.C. ¤ 654-Officer or employee of the
   238	      United States converting the property of
   239	      another.
   240	      18 U.S.C. ¤ 1341-Fraud.
   241	      18 U.S.C. ¤ 1343-Wire fraud.
   242	      18 U.S.C. ¤1505-Obstruction of proceedings
   243	      before departments, agencies and committees.
   244	      18 U.S.C. ¤ 1512-Tampering with a witness.
   245	      18 U.S.C. ¤ 1513-Retaliation against a witness.
   246	      18 U.S.C. ¤ 1621-Perjury.
   247	      18 U.S.C. ¤ 1951-Interference with commerce by
   248	      threats or violence (RICO).
   249	      18 U.S.C. ¤ 1961 et seq.-Racketeer Influenced
   250	      and Corrupt Organizations.
   251	      18 U.S.C. ¤ 2314- Transportation of stolen
   252	      goods, securities, moneys.
   253	      18 U..S.C. ¤ 2315-Receiving stolen goods.
   254	  
   255	  15.  Several key documents subpoenaed by the committee  on
   256	July  26,  1991,  were  reported  missing  or  lost  by  the
   257	Department. While Justice officials have indicated that this
   258	involves  only  a  limited  number  of  documents,  it   was
   259	impossible  to  ascertain how many documents or  files  were
   260	missing because the Department did not have a complete index
   261	of the INSLAW materials. The Department failed to conduct  a
   262	formal  investigation  to determine whether  the  subpoenaed
   263	documents were stolen or illegally destroyed.
   264	  
   265	                     XI. RECOMMENDATIONS
   266	  
   267	  1.  The  committee recommends that Attorney  General  Barr
   268	immediately  settle INSLAW's claims in a fair and  equitable
   269	manner.
   270	  These   payments  should  account  for  the   Department's
   271	continued  unauthorized use of INSLAW's Enhanced PROMIS  and
   272	other costs attributed to INSLAW's ongoing attempt to obtain
   273	a  just  settlement  for its struggle with  the  Department,
   274	including all reasonable attorneys' fees. If there  continue
   275	to  be  efforts  to delay a fair and equitable  result,  the
   276	committee  should determine whether legislation is  required
   277	to  authorize  a claim by INSLAW against the United  States,
   278	pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ¤ 1492.
   279	  2.  The Attorney General should require that any person in
   280	the   Department  that  participated  in  any  way  in   the
   281	litigation  of  the INSLAW matter be excluded  from  further
   282	involvement  in this case, with the exception  of  supplying
   283	information, as needed, to support future investigations  by
   284	a independent counsel or litigation, as appropriate.
   285	  3.  The  committee strongly recommends that the Department
   286	appoint  an  independent counsel to  conduct  a  full,  open
   287	investigation  of the INSLAW allegations  of  a  high  level
   288	conspiracy  within the Department to steal  Enhanced  PROMIS
   289	software  to  benefit  friends  and  associates  of   former
   290	Attorney  General  Meese,  including  Dr.  Earl  Brian,   as
   291	discussed   in   this  report.  Among  other  matters,   the
   292	investigation should also:
   293	      
   294	      Ascertain whether there was a strategy by  former
   295	     Attorneys  General and other Department  officials
   296	     to  obstruct this and other investigations through
   297	     employee  harassment  and  denial  of  access   to
   298	     Department records.
   299	      Investigate Mr. Casolaro's death.
   300	      Determine  whether  current  and  former  Justice
   301	     Department  officials and others involved  in  the
   302	     INSLAW  affair resorted to perjury and obstruction
   303	     in order to coverup their misdeeds.
   304	      Determine  whether  the documents  subpoenaed  by
   305	     the   Committee  and  reported  missing   by   the
   306	     Department were stolen or illegally destroyed.
   307	      Determine    if   private   sector    individuals
   308	     participated  in  (1)  the alleged  conspiracy  to
   309	     steal  INSLAW's PROMIS software and distribute  it
   310	     to  various  locations domestically and  overseas,
   311	       and  (2)  the alleged coverup of this conspiracy
   312	     through perjury and obstruction.
   313	      
   314	  Determine   if   other   criminal   violations    occurred
   315	involving:
   316	      18 U.S.C. ¤ 371-Conspiracy to commit an offense.
   317	      18 U.S.C. ¤ 654-0fficer or employee of the
   318	      United States converting the property of
   319	      another.
   320	      18 U.S.C. ¤ 1341-Fraud.
   321	      18 U.S.C. ¤ 1343-Wire fraud.
   322	      18 U.S.C. ¤ 1505-Obstruction of proceedings
   323	      before departments, agencies and committees.
   324	      18 U.S.C. ¤ 1512-Tampering with a witness.
   325	      18 U.S.C. ¤ 1513-Retaliation against a witness.
   326	      18 U.S.C. ¤ 1621-Perjury. 18 U.S.C.
   327	      ¤1951-Interference with commerce by threats or
