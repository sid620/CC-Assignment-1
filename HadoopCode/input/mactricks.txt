     6	
     7	As I am an older person, with sort of a career, I don t have time to follow
     8	everything in Phruwt.  
     9	I thought I would list some of my favorite Mac apps and some ideas on how
    10	to use them.  
    11	A lot of these have probably been mentioned before, but I hadn't seen
    12	anything and maybe someone would post more beginner tricks to improve upon
    13	this list. I purposely left out the apps that you have at yer sight, the
    14	dialers, tone generators, etc... as I believe you ve probably discussed
    15	this stuff. These tricks have helped me look like some kind of computer
    16	expert to my associates. None of these require any language skills. 
    17	 
    18	This is my list of prank programs for idiots. You must use you're
    19	imagination with these; 
    20	 
    21	ResEdit - The standard. Read as much as you can on this. Lots of good text
    22	floating about this. Good once you have access to someones computer. Make
    23	disk formatting, keyboard recorders and other nasty programs appear to be
    24	something else. 
    25	 
    26	DiskTop - Good when you need to make files invisible etc...quickly, like
    27	when that certain someone leaves the room to powder the nose etc.... Other
    28	programs have more features, but none are so quick and 99% of Mac users don
    29	t know about invisible files. 
    30	 
    31	CanOpener - Opens almost anything so you can read text view pictures etc...
    32	Great for finding passwords etc... on someones computer. Good for fast
    33	searches. I have found passwords with this. 
    34	 
    35	Macro Programs (QuicKeys, Tempo etc...) Great for making bombs. I was doin
    36	this before I ever heard about ANSI bombs. A bombs is sort of like a virus,
    37	but undetectable by virus software. The first SUCCESSFUL use of this was on
    38	a friend who spent money on virus detecting programs. I told him that those
    39	programs were bullshit and that I could prove it. Now being he was a male
    40	and macho and of course he was the computer expert, I had to fuck with him.
    41	About a month later he turned on his computer to find a bunch of his files
    42	renamed and a note from me via teach text on his computer. He knew that he
    43	got it off of one of my floppies that he had checked with his stupid virus
    44	program, the one that wastes your time while it reads your drives and shit.
    45	I never told him how I did it, but  after a few days of him sweating I
    46	removed the invisibles and promised it wouldn t happen again. 
    47	Hint: Put macro program on a floppy with other nasties. Leave the floppy
    48	somewhere and title it in such a way that a certain operator will be
    49	compelled to install it on the target computer. Include a TeachText file
    50	that says  READ ME FIRST  telling them how to install the inits. Then
    51	instructions telling them that they have to reboot and later hit a certain
    52	key combination to get help on how to use the software/game or in my
    53	favorite version make a list of key commands that appear to be the commands
    54	to open my private diary, love letters, nude picts. etc.... Now of course
    55	the key commands will kick in the macro that can do a variety of tricks
    56	such as make important files invisible, turn on and hide a keystroke
    57	recorder(I haven t done this yet as I haven t found a keystroke recorder
    58	for the Mac that works invisibly yet, any ideas).  
    59	You could in theory format the hard drive if they worked off a floppy with
    60	a modified utility(now that would be a nasty thing to do). 
    61	  
    62	The fancy Macro programs have lots of options such as make a newer Mac turn
    63	on at 5:30AM and then do the dirty work when no one is around no keystroke
    64	needed. The new Macs can be made to turn on when no one is around. Also
    65	recently I ve been experimenting with the new Macintalk and sound file
    66	shit. Set up a macro to play a sound or mysteriously type and read text.
    67	This freaks people out more than if yer tricks were fucking the files up. I
    68	have a birthday bomb that I put on peoples powerbooks that sings happy
    69	birthday with my voice, on their b day starting at 5:00 in the morning and
    70	repeating every two hours. The computer would wake up sing happy birthday
    71	and then go back to sleep. Most of the people never figure out how I did
    72	it. It s just QuicKeys and my voice recorded with that microphone that
    73	comes with the Mac. You then remove the sound file from the system, make it
    74	invisible and put it with the macro program.  
    75	 
    76	 
    77	Utility Programs such as Norton, Mac Tools etc... Many uses. The most
    78	useful in my opinion is recovering deleted files. If used on the right
    79	computer/user with other programs, you ll receive tons of info thats
    80	supposed to be confidential (Password hints etc...). 
    81	 
    82	Data fork editors such as Macsnoop, Snooper(I think) etc... For modifying
    83	copy protection, passwords etc... 
    84	 
    85	Any kind of programming shit is good if you understand the basics.
    86	Debuggers etc... 
    87	Look around the programmers sights and download. Steal a copy from a
    88	friend. 
    89	 
    90	And most important social engineering. I won t go into details here. Most
    91	of my friends think this is how I get my tricks, but I actually don t have
    92	that many and I learned them by myself. 
    93	 
    94	WARNING!!!  All of these programs/methods will most likely fuck shit up, so
    95	make sure you only work on back-ups. Even the Macro programs can fuck up
    96	files or crash when you start getting really tricky. Always test thoroughly
    97	before going with it. 
    98	 
    99	Now I know any kind of ELITE HACKER wouldn t stoop to this shit. But these
   100	tricks are a kick for the beginner Mac types.  
   101	The Mac or Windows OS s has a lot more back doors than those old text base
   102	OS s that yer parents used. People tend to only see the obvious, making
   103	things a lot easier for the people who can escape DOS, UNIX etc...There are
   104	a lot more non programming tricks out there, but these are the ones I use.
