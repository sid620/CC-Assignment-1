    26	This is not an article about technology.  It's an article about human
    27	needs.  For example:
    28	
    29	
    30	=>  A doctor telecommunicates a CAT scan from her small hospital to
    31	the nearest major medical center.
    32	
    33	=>  An MIT professor uses his desktop computer in Cambridge to tutor a
    34	talented young physicist on a reservation in rural Montana.
    35	
    36	=>  Biologists scattered around the world exchange data on an hourly
    37	basis, coordinating their effort to map the human genetic code.
    38	
    39	=>  A grassroots political organization gets the word out about a
    40	meeting, just in time to mobilize for a municipal legislative session.
    41	
    42	=>  Each of these activities, science-fiction as they might sound,
    43	actually are happening today, courtesy of computer-mediated
    44	telecommunication networks.  The future of this technology is a matter
    45	of much behind-the-scenes maneuvering.  Roger Karraker, instructor in
    46	journalism and Macintosh at Santa Rosa Junior College, has teased out
    47	the key issues from a politically and technically complex debate.

    51				**********************************
    52	
    53	
    54	 A quiet but crucial  debate now under way in Congress, in major
    55	corporate boardrooms, and in universities, has the potential to shape
    56	American in the 21st century and beyond. The outcome may determine
    57	where you live, how well your children are educated, who will blossom
    58	and who will wither in a society where national competitiveness and
    59	personal prosperity will likely depend on access to information.
    60	
    61	The battle is about who will build, own, use and pay for the
    62	high-speed data highways of the future and whether their content will
    63	be censored. These vast data highways, capable of sending entire
    64	libraries coast-to-coast in a few seconds or sending crucial CAT scans
    65	>from a remote village to urban specialists, could be linked in a vast
    66	network of "highways of the mind."
    67	
    68	The backbone of these communications networks will be built of fiber
    69	optics, hair-thick strands of glass, transmitting digital pulses
    70	thousands of times faster than ever before. In addition to their
    71	speed, fiber optics bring  with them an environmental bonus: fiber
    72	optics are made of silicon, the earth's most common element and the
    73	growing use of optical fibers will mean much less demand for
    74	traditional cables composed of copper, an element whose fabrication
    75	causes much environmental damage.
    76	
    77	Futurist Alvin Toffler says the future of the United States depends
    78	upon the creation of these networks. "Because so much of business now
    79	depends on getting and sending information, companies around the world
    80	have been rushing to link their employees through electronic networks.
    81	These networks form the key infrastructure of the 21st century, as
    82	critical to business success and national economic development as the
    83	railroads were in [Samuel] Morse's era."
    84	
    85	These data highways connecting schools, colleges, universities,
    86	researchers and industry  could help create high-quality education in
    87	the smallest schools, or start a society-wide revolution as important
    88	as the invention of printing.
    89	
    90	 Conversely, if access to such data networks is restricted to only
    91	those who already have money, power and information then the highways
    92	of the mind might become nothing more than a classic case of economic
    93	imperialism, taxation without communication, that one critic has
    94	dubbed "toll roads between information castles."
    95	
    96	Virtually all sides to the controversy agree that such networks  are
    97	essential. The future belongs to those who have ready access to huge
    98	amounts of accurate information. The Japanese government and industry
    99	are actively building such a network. The Japanese government
   100	estimates that in 20 years 35 percent of Japan's gross national
   101	product will be dependent on information that flows across this web.
   102	
   103	In the United States there is only a vague consensus that this
   104	high-bandwidth network is vital. In place of the unity of purpose
   105	evident in Japan, there is internecine squabbling  over who has the
   106	right to do what/to where/to whom.
   107	
   108	___________
   109	 Four Questions
   110	
   111	At issue are vastly different visions of the roles of government,
   112	education and corporations. Four key questions dominate the debate:
   113	
   114	1. Who will build the network? (Will the federal government create the
   115	infrastructure or will it be left to private enterprise?)
   116	
   117	2. Who will have access to network services? The debate here is
   118	between those who would restrict the network's services to the
   119	nation's research leaders  and those who believe in access to anyone
   120	with a modem .
   121	
   122	3. Who will pay for all this? Everyone concedes that the federal
   123	government will pay the lion's share of getting the network underway.
   124	But should it do so by directly funding the infrastructure or by
   125	paying the user fees of just the big research organizations working on
   126	federal projects?
   127	
   128	4. What kind of information will be allowed on the network? If the
   129	federal government owns the network, the First Amendment is in place
   130	and unpopular speech and art will be protected. If private enterprise
   131	owns and runs the network, freedom of electronic speech is less clear.
   132	Conceivably, a corporation owning the network could refuse to allow
   133	discussion of controversial topics.
   134	
   135	So far, two models or metaphor - "highways" and "railroads" have been
   136	proposed to frame the debate. Both borrow from transportation examples
   137	in U.S. history. Both, I believe, fall short of the mark. And we
   138	suggest that a little tweaking of the two, the best solution for the
   139	U.S. might be found in a kind of synthesis of these different visions.
   140	
   141	___________
   142	 The Interstate Highway Model
   143	
   144	One vision, championed most visibly by U.S. Sen. Albert Gore (D-Tenn.)
   145	is to create a National Research and Education Network (NREN) that
   146	will link the nation's top research, education, corporate and
   147	governmental researchers. Gore's bill to create NREN  died in the last
   148	Congress but was re-introduced in January, 1991 with more coordinated
   149	support among governmental agencies.  The NREN proposal is just one
   150	part of the government's five-year, $2 billion High Performance
   151	Computing Program, which includes supercomputers, software, networking
   152	and education.
   153	
   154	Gore speaks of a "catalyst" role for the Federal Government akin to
   155	the creation of the interstate highway system in the 1950s. The
   156	interstate transportation system was seen as a national resource and
   157	national tax monies were used to finance the infrastructure, which
   158	benefited all Americans through more far-flung, decentralized
   159	distribution of goods and services.
   160	
   161	The highway model - that government recognizes the communications
   162	infrastructure as a vital national resource - is the norm throughout
   163	Japan, Europe and most of the world.
   164	
   165	___________
   166	 The Railroad Model
   167	
   168	IBM, MCI and other private firms prefer a different model:  private
   169	enterprise and quasi-monopolies such as America's railroads of the
   170	19th century.
   171	
   172	The decision in the 19th century to give private transportation
   173	monopolies to the railroads and let them determine the nation's
   174	destiny created the 20th century landscape of America. Not
   175	surprisingly towns and farms accessible to the railroads prospered and
   176	grew. Areas ignored by the railroads withered and died.
   177	
   178	Under the railroad model, the public and the government weren't
   179	consulted; private interest, not  national interest, determined who
   180	got what. It was pure free market capitalism with no government
   181	regulation, no direct governmental investment and led to some  ugly
   182	excesses. Yet at a time when federal budget deficits approach $300
   183	billion per year the idea of letting private enterprise foot the whole
   184	bill is powerfully attractive.
   185	
   186	And that is essentially what IBM, MCI and Merit, an agency of the
   187	state of Michigan have proposed. Last September they formed ANS
   188	(Advanced Network Services), a not-for-profit joint venture that
   189	proposes to build and maintain a private network.  But the federal
   190	government would need to guarantee that the research institutions
   191	would have annual budgets sufficient to pay their ANS bills.
   192	
   193	___________
   194	 Why Decide Now?
   195	
   196	The existing national research communication system is woefully
   197	inadequate to today's needs and must be updated soon; this technical
   198	obsolescence lends urgency to the need for finding answers to these
   199	policy questions.
   200	
   201	The question is how best to modernize and expand the DARPA/Internet
   202	network . It the late 1960s, the Defense Department's Advanced
   203	Research Projects Agency (ARPA) created a network of telephone lines
   204	connected to large research institutions in government, education,
   205	private enterprise and the military  to allow researchers to exchange
   206	computerized information.
   207	
   208	Over the next decade and a half the number of researchers grew
   209	significantly. As computers grew more powerful and easier to use,
   210	researchers outside the computer sciences began to use remote
   211	terminals and telecommunication networks to exchange messages and
   212	share computing resources from their homes, offices, and laboratories.
   213	Each research center supported dozens or hundreds of users, and each
   214	local center was plugged into the overall network; thus, both the
   215	number of nodes in the network and the number of users at each node
   216	proliferated. The number of regional networks in government, business
   217	and education skyrocketed, as did connections to ARPANet's main lines,
   218	or "backbone". Most importantly, the type of data exchanged by
   219	researchers changed dramatically. Where once simple electronic mail
   220	messages were sufficient, collaborators across the nation now needed
   221	to exchange high-density data like sounds, CAT scans, other graphic
   222	images, even video images.
   223	
   224	By 1987 the ARPANet suffered data gridlock and the last of its 1970s
   225	state-of-the-art lines (56,000 digital "bits" per second - about
   226	50,000 words per minute) were laid to rest. ARPANet's successor is
   227	NSFNET, funded until 1993 by the National Science Foundation, another
   228	government agency. NSFNET's original lines were so-called T-1 or 1.544
   229	million bits per second - 28 times the capacity of ARPANet. These
   230	lines lasted just three years, and are now being replaced by a newer
   231	T-3 (45 million bits per second) backbone - another 28-fold increase.
   232	No one expects it to last for long.
   233	
   234	The growth of the so-called Internet  -  those machines connected to
   235	the NSFNET backbone  -  has been phenomenal. In 1989, the number of
   236	networks attached to the NSFNET/Internet increased from 346 to 997;
   237	data traffic increased five-fold. The latest estimate, itself probably
   238	wildly out-of-date, is that 100,000 to 200,000 main computers are
   239	directly connected to NSFNET, with perhaps a total of two million
   240	individuals able to exchange information.
   241	
   242	For example, the WELL, Whole Earth's computer conferencing system, is
   243	not connected directly to either the NSFNET backbone or the so-called
   244	Internet of sites on the backbone. But the WELL's computer is linked
   245	to Apple Computer's mainframes, and to Pacific Bell's computers and to
   246	the University of California at Berkeley - all of them on the
   247	Internet. So the WELL's 3,500 customers can send electronic mail to
   248	millions of other computer users around the country and, via
   249	connections between the Internet and other countries, all around the
   250	world.
   251	
   252	 NSFNET's phenomenal growth in 1989 was, evidently, just a prelude for
   253	the data deluge that is now in full flood. Traffic more than doubled
   254	between September 1989 and September 1990. It is projected to double
   255	again this year. It won't take too long to exhaust even those T-3
   256	lines that carry 800+ times the data of the pre-1987 lines.
   257	
   258	That's where the NREN proposal comes in. As proposed by the Coalition
   259	for the National Research and Education Network and championed by
   260	Senator Gore, Congress would authorize the network and provide $400
   261	million over five years to put it in place. The universities and
   262	research centers would pay the additional costs for the local area
   263	networks that would connect their scholars to the network.
   264	
   265	When completed in 1995 the network would have a 3-gigabit backbone - 3
   266	billion bits per second, a 66-fold increase over the current T-3
   267	capacity, a 50,000-fold increase over the old ARPA lines. That's about
   268	300 million times faster than the clattering state-of-the-art
   269	teletypes I used at the Associated Press a quarter-century ago.
   270	
   271	___________
   272	 From CAT Scans to Instant Encyclopedias
   273	
   274	What can you do with 3 billion bits per second? The NREN Coalition
   275	likens it to sending 100 three-dimensional x-rays and CAT scans every
   276	second for 100 cancer patients, or sending 1,000 satellite photographs
   277	to researchers investigating agricultural productivity, environmental
   278	pollution or weather prediction. Reduced to just words, it would be
   279	100,000 typed pages per second, or as the Coalition dangles
   280	tantalizingly before us, "making it possible to transmit the entire
   281	Encyclopedia Brittanica in a second...."
   282	
   283	Now before you begin salivating at the thought of every book, every
   284	magazine article available instantaneously at your slightest whim,
   285	here's the rub: as currently designed, NREN's 3-gigabit data lines
   286	aren't coming to your house, or your kids' school, even your local
   287	library. NREN will connect only the largest research universities and
   288	consortia, at least one in every state. From there, lower-speed
   289	regional networks would connect nearby institutions. At the bottom of
   290	NREN's proposed three-tier system would be local campus networks.
   291	There's no plan or provision for K-12 schools or local libraries in
   292	the NREN proposal.
   293	
   294	 One doesn't need the vast capacity of NREN to exchange simple
   295	electronic mail. There are many alternative, if slower, networks
   296	available. Using super-sophisticated NREN for such mundane tasks might
   297	be like trying to get a drink out of a fire hose. And it's problematic
   298	whether local schools and libraries would be able to pay for the
   299	equipment needed to exchange items much more complex than simple
   300	electronic mail. There's the potential here for the creation of
   301	information haves and information have-nots. As Apple Computer
   302	librarian Steve Cisler puts it, "If this is going to be a data
   303	superhighway, how would you like to have to go to a computer company,
   304	military base, or university to find an onramp?"
   305	
   306	Dave Hughes, a Colorado telecommunications pioneer, takes a more
   307	cautious view of the slimmed-down NREN that Gore and others are trying
   308	to push through Congress. An ex-Army colonel and former aide to
   309	Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, Hughes believes that NREN's plan,
   310	with local schools not even mentioned, could perpetuate educational
   311	elitism, where the already-prosperous research universities get
   312	additional taxpayer-paid subsidized service and the already-poor local
   313	schools get short shrift.
   314	
   315	Which doesn't mean that Dave Hughes doesn't want to see a high-speed
   316	data network. To the contrary, he wants it to reach every corner of
   317	America, terminating in at least each of the 16,000 local school
   318	districts. Such as the 114 one-room school houses in Montana which he
   319	and Frank Odasz of Western Montana College have managed to connect up,
   320	after a fashion, through their Big Sky Telegraph system, and and from
   321	there out to the rest of the world. And over which a theoretical
   322	physicist from MIT has been able to teach a course in chaos theory
   323	mathematics to students in these schools - which the physicist cannot
   324	do through the Internet workstation on his MIT desk, Hughes says.
   325	Hughes and Odasz already have created a grassroots online culture in
   326	the wide-open spaces where physical isolation reinforces the lack of
   327	ready access to national sources of information.
   328	
   329	Hughes wants either to flatten NREN's three tiers of service into a
   330	single tier, or have guarantees of affordable access and compatible
   331	protocols between the three tiers to and from every
   332	educational/political subdivision in America. From observing online
   333	behavior nationally for the past 11 years, he thinks talent will find
   334	its own level on the network, and that those with neither the talent
   335	or motivation will be satisfied with local bulletin-boards and video
   336	games. He believes all schools in the country should have the right of
   337	access under the law, including either affordable rates, or
   338	appropriate subsidies down to the local level.
   339	
   340	"The implicit assumptions behind the NREN proposal," Hughes says, "are
   341	that it will only link large research (which also may be 'educational'
   342	in the sense of higher education) institutions. As currently conceived
   343	NREN will NOT extend to the 16,000 K-12 school districts in America,
   344	much less foster the vision of a nation of people learning all their
   345	lives by mixing institutional (edifice-centered) education and
   346	training, and learning, formally and informally, from home, library,
   347	place of business or study.
   348	
   349	"So the metaphor of the need for 'Highways of the Mind' across this
   350	land is very deceptive. It really could turn out to mean 'Super Toll
   351	Roads between Castles.' That is not my vision of a Network Nation."
   352	___________
   353	 The Network Nation
   354	
   355	What would a real Network Nation be like? Conservative theorist/author
   356	George Gilder, like Hughes, foresees a renaissance in education caused
   357	by the "telecomputer": the merger of fiber optic telephone service to
   358	the home and new ultra-powerful multimedia computers.
   359	
   360	"The telecomputer could revitalize public education by bringing the
   361	best teachers in the country to classrooms everywhere," Gilder says.
   362	"More important, the telecomputer could encourage competition because
   363	it could make home schooling both feasible and attractive. To learn
   364	social skills, neighborhood children could gather in micro-schools run
   365	by parents, churches or other local institutions. The competition of
   366	home schooling would either destroy the public school system or force
   367	it to become competitive with rival systems..."
   368	
   369	High-speed data communications to the home might also revolutionize
   370	where and how we live. Data communications could allow rural
   371	tele-commuting, ending two centuries of "brain drain" from the
   372	countryside to the cities.
   373	
   374	Gilder says, "Every morning millions of commuters across America sit
   375	in cars inching their way toward cluttered, polluted and crime-ridden
   376	cities," he says.
   377	
   378	"Or they sit in dilapidated trains rattling toward office towers that
   379	survive as business centers chiefly because of their superior access
   380	to the global network of computers and telecommunications. With
   381	telecomputers in every home attached to global fiber network, why
   382	would anyone commute? People would be able to see the boss life-size
   383	in high-definition video and meet with him as easily at home as at the
   384	office. They would be able to reach with equal immediacy the head of
   385	the foreign subsidiary or the marketing chief across the country. They
   386	would be able to send and receive documents almost instantly from
   387	anywhere."
   388	
   389	___________
   390	 Who Pays the Bill?
   391	
   392	 Whether it's the $400 million Gore's NREN bill calls for or the
   393	untold billions required for fiber optics to the home, high-speed data
   394	communications will cost a bundle and the major political battle is
   395	over who will pay.
   396	
   397	For Gilder and for many of us who hope to benefit from fiber-to-the
   398	home, the answer is clear: let the local telephone companies install
   399	fiber to every home, amortize the cost and add it to our monthly
   400	telephone bills.
   401	
   402	To consumer groups and many state public utilities commissions that
   403	reeks of reverse Robin Hood-ism: stealing from the poor, retired and
   404	elderly who may never be able to utilize the capabilities of the new
   405	system in order to subsidize the corporations, universities and a
   406	well-educated few. Indeed, that's already underway. Much of the U.S.
   407	telephone system, especially in the central cities and along corporate
   408	"data corridors" has already been converted to fiber optic service and
   409	the costs rolled into the local telephone rate.
   410	
   411	Another option: last September IBM and MCI, who already operate NSFNET
   412	under contract, proposed to build a "private Internet" backbone that
   413	would require less governmental funding, but would involve user fees.
   414	Advanced Network Services, the IBM/MCI non-profit joint venture, would
   415	build and operate the network.
   416	
   417	The benefit, as IBM exec Allan H. Weis, president/chief executive
   418	officer of ANS puts it, is ""Because we are broadening the community
   419	of those using the network, the fixed costs of national networking
   420	will be more widely distributed.  This will free up funds which could
   421	then be allocated to assist the neediest organizations to connect to
   422	the national network, as well as to continue to support and enable the
   423	national network to remain in the vanguard of new technology."
   424	
   425	That doesn't sit well with Dave Hughes. "With this Administration, the
   426	budget crunch, and general ignorance of the implications, I'm afraid
   427	that the decision makers  - including Congress - will welcome 'private
   428	enterprise' with open arms. And overlook such minor details as 'equal
   429	access.' No, it will be 'if you got the bucks you can buy it.' Kiss
   430	off the idea that all K-12 schools will have 'educational' access."
   431	
   432	Mitch Kapor, the co-founder of Lotus Computing and the president  of
   433	the Electronic Frontier Foundation, also believes that universal
   434	access should be a central tenet of any national network policy.
   435	
   436	"Whatever infrastructure we create," Kapor says, "should incorporate a
   437	notion of 'universal digital service', much  as AT&T pioneered, and
   438	which later became national policy, with respect to voice telephony in
   439	the early 20th century. Everyone should be able to connect to the
   440	net."
   441	
   442	Hughes and Kapor approach the NREN controversy from substantially
   443	different perspectives. Hughes is suspicious of turning the nation's
   444	infrastructure over to the agendas of private enterprise.
   445	
   446	As Hughes terms it,  "I am concerned about the U.S. mind-set which,
   447	without thinking, says that the 'private sector' should provide
   448	telecommunications in the U.S. simply because that is the way it
   449	always has been, while in a couple other key areas - sewage, highways,
   450	and education - that is not the case.
   451	
   452	"If we believe so mightily that our national future is very much
   453	wrapped up in computing and telecommunications - and that especially
   454	'research and education' are going to have to be improved mightily for
   455	us to compete - then we ought to be thinking a lot more carefully than
   456	we are now about which portion of telecommunications should be
   457	government provided/subsidized/regulated and which portion pure
   458	profit-and-loss commercial."
   459	
   460	Kapor, one of the country's most respected entrepreneurs, suggests
   461	that one way to satisfy both Big Scientists and Universalists is to
   462	have, in effect, two networks, achieved by "overlaying"
   463	lower-bandwidth networks onto an NREN-like backbone.
   464	
   465	"These high-end and low-end visions of the NREN are strikingly
   466	different. There is no assurance that one size network fits all. Some
   467	important public policy choices will therefore be made, one way or the
   468	other," he says.
   469	
   470	While he lauds the IBM/MCI/ANS group for its donations of millions of
   471	dollars to NSFNET computing, Kapor is concerned that ANS policies may
   472	become, by default, national polices concerning telecommunications
   473	without the benefit of public debate. ANS, he says, is already
   474	establishing policies for measuring network traffic, billing and
   475	accounting, and setting access charges for new information
   476	entrepreneurs, all without the normal hearing and rule-setting process
   477	required of public utilities.
   478	
   479	"What ANS does in the way of setting up  commercial access to the
   480	national information infrastructure may well become, in effect,
   481	national policy," Kapor says. "But there is no guarantee of public
   482	accountability.
   483	
   484	"We are dependent on the continued good will of ANS in setting its
   485	policies. We don't know, for instance, whether the technology for
   486	counting traffic on the net that ANS develops will be as enabling for
   487	would-be information entrepreneurs as it will for big corporate
   488	information providers. Without an open public process for getting
   489	input in the development of the net, the resulting choices are less
   490	likely to be in the public interest."
   491	
   492	Kapor also sees that a purely private enterprise such as ANS may not
   493	be fully in consonance with the goals of Electronic Frontier
   494	Foundation's goals, including  First Amendment guarantees for
   495	electronic speech and guaranteed access to communications services at
   496	fair prices.
   497	
   498	EFF's recent newsletter noted that Prodigy, a national computer
   499	communications system half owned by IBM, has been embroiled in
   500	disputes because of its policy of reading and censoring postings made
   501	to Prodigy's public forums.
   502	
   503	"I believe it's important to establish the legal principle that
   504	businesses which offer a network service which is principally that of
   505	a conduit - moving bits from here to there - may not restrict the
   506	content of the information they carry. The ability to restrict
   507	content, whether conducted by the government in the form of
   508	censorship, or by a private carrier for whatever reason,  is not
   509	conducive to the free and open flow of information," he says.
   510	
   511	___________
   512	 So What' the Answer?
   513	
   514	Now let's play Chinese menu, taking a few items from column A (Gore's
   515	NREN/Big Scientists bill) and column B (the Universalists approach).
   516	
   517	A workable national network might include the following features:
   518	
   519	=> Built and managed by private enterprise
   520	
   521	=> Federal start-up subsidies for colleges, universities, libraries
   522	and schools
   523	
   524	=> First Amendment free speech guarantees
   525	
   526	=> Guaranteed interconnection to other data services offered by
   527	telephone companies and other locally regulated businesses
   528	
   529	=> Guaranteed universal digital access for everyone who wants to
   530	connect
   531	
   532	=> Fair rates and policies subject to regulatory review
   533	
   534	In short, we'd have a regulated public utility: precisely the system
   535	that the U.S. used over the past century to develop the best  -  and
   536	cheapest  -  public telephone system in the world.
   537	
   538	The problem, as usual, is in how one defines the purpose of the
   539	national network. Laura Breeden, a network group manager at Bolt
   540	Beranek and Newman (a private research and development company that
   541	was one of the original ARPAnet contractors), frames the issues this
   542	way:
   543	
   544	"If you think of data networking as a public utility, then it seems
   545	important to regulate it in some of the same ways that other utilities
   546	are regulated, i.e. to make sure that basic services are provided to
   547	everyone and not withdrawn unreasonably.
   548	
   549	"If you think of it as a strategic resource, important for insuring
   550	U.S.competitiveness and technological progress, then you put it where
   551	it can do the most good strategically .
   552	
   553	"If you believe that it is important to education generally, then you
   554	put it at as many schools as possible.
   555	
   556	"If you think data networking is some of all of these, you have to
   557	balance the trade-offs among them."
   558	
   559	The National Network is a complex issue. It's safe to say only a
   560	handful of representatives understand the issue in depth. A letter
   561	>from you to your elected representatives asking for reasonable rates,
   562	guaranteed free speech rights and access for local schools, libraries
   563	and homes might make a lot of difference.
