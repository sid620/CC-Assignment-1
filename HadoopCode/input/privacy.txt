     1	PALO ALTO, Calif.-- For the first time in more that a decade,
     2	civil libertarians and computer professionals are banding
     3	together to stop what many consider a Big Brotherish attempt
     4	by the FBI to keep track of peoples lives.
     5	  A Palo Alto-based group, Computer Professionals for Social
     6	Responsibility, has been instrumental in preventing the FBI
     7	from expanding its data base to include information such as
     8	credit card transactions, telephone calls and airline
     9	passangers list.
    10	   "We need computer professionals acting like public
    11	interest lawyers to make sure the FBI is acting responsibly"
    12	said Jerry Berman, chief legislative counsel for the American
    13	Civil Liberties Union.
    14	   Mr Berman was part of a panel Saturday at Stanford
    15	University that went head-to-head with the FBI's assistant
    16	director for technical services, William Bayse, over
    17	expansion of the National Crime Information Center (NCIC).
    18	   Law enforcement officials use the NCIC system's 19.4
    19	million files about 700,000 times a day for routine checks on
    20	everyone from traffic violators to Peace Corps applicants.
    21	   "The FBI would like us to believe that they are protecting
    22	us from the hick Alabama Sheriff who wants to misuse the
    23	system, " said Brian Harvey, a computer expert at the
    24	University of California, Berkeley, "The FBI is the problem."
    25	   Not since the fight to pass the Privacy Act of 1974 have
    26	computer experts, civil libertarians and legislators come
    27	together on the issue of citizen rights and access to
    28	information.
    29	   In the early 1970s, the government's efforts to monitor
    30	more than 125,000 war protesters sparked concerns about
    31	privacy.  The 1974 law limited the movement of information
    32	exchanged by federal agencies.
    33	   But computers were not so sophisticated then, and the
    34	privacy act has several exceptions for law enforcement
    35	agencies, said Marc Rotenberg, one of the computer group's
    36	experts on the data base.
    37	   Two years ago, the FBI announced its plan to expand the
    38	data base, and came up with 240 features to include a sort of
    39	"wish list" culled from the kinds of information law
    40	enforcement officials who use the system would like to have.
    41	   Rep. Don Edwards (D-Calif.) balked at moving ahead with
    42	the plan without suggestions from an independent group, and
    43	put together a panel that includes members of the Palo Alto
    44	computer organization.
    45	   Working with Mr. Bayse, FBI officials eventually agreed to
    46	recommend a triuncated redesign of the data base.  It drops
    47	the most controversial features, such as plans to connect the
    48	data base to records of other government agencies - including
    49	the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue
    50	Service, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Social
    51	Security Administration and the State Department's passport office.
    52	   FBI director William S. Sessions could reject those
    53	recommendations, however, and include all or part of the wish
    54	list in the redesign.  he is expected to decide soon just how
    55	much to expand the system.
    56	   Based in the Hoover Building in Washington, D.C., the
    57	computer system already fills a room half the size of a
    58	football field.  The $20 million to $40 million redesign will
    59	"establish record-keeping at the FBI for the next 10 years,"
    60	said Mr. Rotenberg.  The 20-year-old system has 12 main
    61	files containing information on stolen vehicles, missing
    62	people, criminal arrests and convictions, people who are
    63	suspected of plotting against top-level government officials
    64	and people for whom arrest warrants have been issued.
    65	   In Los Angeles, police squad cars have computer terminals
    66	connected to NCIC data that allow them to check a person's
    67	fingerprints on the scene.
    68	   But the system is far from infallible - and that's what
    69	worries civil libertarians.
    70	   One Michigan man, Terry Dean Rogan, was arrested five
    71	times for crimes he did not commit.  His wallet had been
    72	stolen and he was repeatedly confused with a murder suspect
    73	who had used Mr. Rogan's identification.  Mr. Rogan sued, and
    74	eventually received a $55,000 settlement from Los Angeles
    75	because the city had failed to remove his name from the data
    76	base.
    77	   "If the informationis inaccurate or incomplete, it creates
    78	a stigmatizing effect,"
    79	 Mr. Rotenberg said.  "If you're recorded in the NCIC,
    80	there's a presumption of criminal activity."
    81	   Mr. Bayse told the audience Saturday that the system is
    82	inefficient and outdated, and that the FBI wants to improve
    83	the technology to prohibit occurrences such as the Rogan
    84	case.
    85	   "We need a new system, if nothing else, to implement
    86	internal security and privacy controls as a stopper for
    87	someone maliciously trying to take information out of the
    88	system," he said.
    89	   Civil libertarians are not arguing about the system's
    90	usefulness, but many are wary about the FBI's motives and
    91	about safeguarding sensitive information.
    92	   "Computer systems today are very vulnerable," said
    93	panelist Peter Neumann, an employee of the SRI International
    94	"think tank" in Menlo Park and member of the computer group.
    95	"There are trap doors.  Even the best-designed systems have
    96	crackable internal controls."
    97	   The FBI spends about $1 million a year auditing the system
    98	to correct inaccuracies and has managed to reduce its error
    99	rate by 25 percent.  But evey Mr. Bayse agreed that it's not
   100	perfect.
   101	   "With up to 900,000 queries a day, lots of things can
   102	happen there."
