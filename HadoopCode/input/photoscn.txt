     6	It is a relatively simple task to record a color or monochrome image
     7	displayed on a television set, monitor, or computer screen.  Although
     8	a 35 mm single-lens-relfex (SLR) camera is recommended for ease of
     9	focusing and framing the image, any automatic or adjustable camera will
    10	yield good resutls.  Close focusing capability is a must if the screen
    11	image is to fill the film frame.
    12	    Several options are available:  use a camera with a close-focusing
    13	(macro) lens, use a lens with a fixed focal length of about 100 mm,
    14	use "tele-extenders' to increase the focal length of a normal lens, or
    15	use a supplementary close-up lens on a normal 50 mm lens.  A lens of longer
    16	focal length, (e.g., one of 100 mm), minimizes the effect of screen
    17	curvature.  You also need a stable tripod or platform because exposure
    18	times are too long to permit hand-holding the camera.
    19	
    20	Shutter Speed
    21	Becuase images on a television or computer screen are formed line-by-line
    22	by a rapidly moving electron beam, you can obtain a complete picture of the
    23	screen only if the camera shutter speed is slow enough to allow the moving
    24	beam to complete its scan.  To avoid photographs with dark or light "banding,"
    25	the beam should complete many scans.
    26	    TV images typically are composed of 525 horizontal scan lines (U.S.
    27	standard) or 625 scan lines (the standard adopted by other countries).
    28	For the U.S. standard, a complete scan takes 1/30 second (1/60th for the
    29	odd- and 1/60 for the even-numbered lines).  Theoretically you should use
    30	a shutter speed no faster than 1/30 second, or 1/25 second for a 625-line
    31	picture.  These times are for a camera with a leaf shutter; for cameras
    32	with a focal-plane shutter, reduce shutter speed to 1/8 second in order
    33	to avoid getting a dark band across your picture and to stop TV action
    34	scenes.
    35	    For computer screens, however, the subject is not moving and the
    36	resolution requirements are much higher.  Also, photographs are frequently
    37	made of charts or graphs with light-colored backgrounds, and which show up
    38	dark bands particularly well.  When photographing computer screens, you can
    39	obtain the best results with exposure times of 1/2 to 1 second.  This exposure
    40	puts many images of the screen on the film to minimize the effect of
    41	"banding"--a film speed of ISO 100 is ideal.
    42	
    43	Adjusting The Screen Image
    44	Reduce the contrast of the screen image to slightly below the setting for
    45	normal viewing.  For a black-and-white image, adjust the brightness control so
    46	that there is detail in the highlights and also in the shadows.  For a color
    47	image, adjust the color controls so the image is visually pleasing.
    48	    If your TV, monitor, or computer has an automatic brightness control--
    49	one that varies image brightness in response to changing levels of room
    50	lighting--turn the control off and adjust the brightness manually.  For
    51	computer screens, reduce the brightness so there are no scan lines visible on a
    52	black screen.
    53	
    54	Room Lighting
    55	Darken the room completely if possible, or to a practical level to reduce
    56	ambient illumination.  Doing so helps make the area around the screen image
    57	appear black in your pictures.  A black surround is usually more pleasing than
    58	a lighter one or one reflecting part of the room.  If you photograph screen
    59	images frequently, consider using a specially devised black "tent" or cone that
    60	fits tightly around the screen.
    61	    Do not use flash or other lighting to illuminate the screen; it will
    62	overpower the screen image.  If you camera is equipped with automatic flash,
    63	disable it or cover the flash with a piece of cardboard or other opaque material.
    64	
    65	Film Recommendations
    66	Use daylight color film to photgraph images on color screens.  Color pictures of
    67	color screen images may have a blue-green appearance because the sensitivity of
    68	the film is different from that of the eye.  Use a slow film, e.g., KODAK
    69	EKTACHROME 100 Profressional Film.  This film speed will call for a 1-second
    70	exposure at f-8 to f-11.  A 400-speed film may be too fast; you will not be
    71	able to stop down to near f-11.  Excellent photographs of computer screens are
    72	made using small f-stops (to account for screen curvature) _and_ long shutter
    73	speeds.  KODACHROME 25 Professional Film has produced very good results.
    74	   To improve color rendition with KODACHROME and EKTACHROME Professional Films,
    75	you may need to use a KODAK Color Compensating Filter CC10 or 20R over the
    76	camera lens and to increase the exposure by 1/3 stop.  Use a CC20B filter with
    77	a color negative film such as KODAK VERICOLOR III Professional Film, which
    78	provides brighter colors than and increased color contrast over the "conventional"
    79	100-speed film.  Experiment with this film, becasue it works better with some
    80	phosphors than others.
    81	    You can also use the above color films to record the white, green, or amber
    82	images from monochrome computer screens (without the use of color compensating
    83	filters), or use black-and-white films if you do not need to retain the green or
    84	amber colors in the picture.

    88	Exposure Determination
    89	Choose the correct shutter speed (1/2 to 1 second for computer screens and
    90	1/4 to 1/8 second for TV images), and leave the f-stop stetting to be determined.
    91	Consult your camera manual to determine how to set exposures with an essentially
    92	fixed shutter speed.
    93	    Cameras equipped with a built-in exposure meter are useful, but the TV or
    94	computer screen should fill the image area when the reading is taken.  For
    95	typical displays of "average" color and brightness content, you meter should
    96	yield correctly exposed slides.  For predominantly bright displays, bracket
    97	exposures on the "overexpose" side; for predominantly dark screen displays,
    98	bracket on the "underexposure" side.  If you have through-the-lens metering
    99	and you are using a color film with a color compensating filter over the camera
   100	lens, your camera should automatically increase exposure to compensate for
   101	attenuation by the filter.
   102	    To be sure of getting a properly exposed picture, bracket your exposures.
   103	In 1/3-stop increments, overexpose or underexpose 1 full stop from any
   104	calculated exposure.
