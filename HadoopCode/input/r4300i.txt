    45	Chapter 2. Overview 
    46	
    47	
    48	This paper introduces the RISC R4300i microprocessor from MIPS Technologies,
    49	Inc. (MTI). The information presented in this paper discusses how 
    50	the R4300i differs from previous microprocessors from MTI. 
    51	
    52	This chapter provides general information on the R4300i, including:

    60	
    61	Introduction 
    62	
    63	
    64	Reduced instruction-set computer (RISC) architectures differ from 
    65	older complex instruction-set computer (CISC) architectures by optimizing 
    66	performance for the available silicon area. The MIPS architecture,
    67	developed by MTI, is firmly established as the leading RISC architecture 
    68	today. 
    69	
    70	The MIPS R4300i microprocessor extends the benefits of RISC's performance 
    71	to consumer electronics. The R4300i microprocessor also delivers 
    72	high performance to existing embedded and computing applications 
    73	at a low cost. The low cost and high performance provided by the 
    74	R4300i are needed for the latest consumer applications such as interactive 
    75	television and games. 
    76	
    77	In the beginning, RISC microprocessors were typically used for high 
    78	performance applications. Lately, these processors have found their 
    79	way into the embedded systems market as well. Today, MIPS RISC processors 
    80	are used in network controllers, laser printers, and X-terminals 
    81	among other applications. The migration of MIPS RISC processors to 
    82	these applications has been facilitated by lower costs as well as 
    83	high integration of various functional blocks into a single die. 
    84	The R4300i can deliver up to 60 times the integer performance of 
    85	a VAX 11/780 (60 SPECint '92) at a cost approaching less than $1 
    86	per SPECint. The R4300i is also designed for low power so that it 
    87	can be offered in a low cost plastic package. This makes the R4300i 
    88	a strong candidate for consumer and embedded applications. 
    89	
    90	Between 1985 and 1994, three generations of the MIPS architecture 
    91	have been introduced and widely adopted. The first commercial MIPS 
    92	processor, the R2000, ran at 8-MHz and used a 32-bit architecture. 
    93	The R3000 family raised system speed to 40 MHz. The R4000 family 
    94	uses a 64-bit architecture to boost instruction throughput and increase 
    95	the available address space. It also adds multilevel cache and multiprocessor 
    96	capabilities. The R4000 family (R4400PC, R4400SC, R4400MC, R4000PC 
    97	and R4000SC) currently work at pipeline speeds of up to 200 MHz. 
    98	Recently MTI announced the MIPS R10000 microprocessor that offers 
    99	industry leading performance for scientific and database applications. 
   100	
   101	
   102	MTI's semiconductor partners have successfully implemented MIPS standard 
   103	processors in a variety of semiconductor processes and introduced 
   104	numerous derivative products. MTI semiconductor partners include 
   105	Integrated Device Technology, Inc., LSI Logic Corp., NEC Corporation,
   106	Performance Semiconductor, Inc., Siemens and Toshiba Corporation. 
   107	Users of the MIPS architecture include AT&T, Cisco, Control Data,
   108	NEC, Network Computing Devices, Pyramid Technology, QMS, Siemens-
   109	Nixdorf, Silicon Graphics, Sony, Texas Instruments and Tektronix. 
   110	
   111	R4300i Microprocessor 
   112	
   113	
   114	The R4300i uses a variety of techniques to provide high performance 
   115	at low cost and low power consumption. These techniques include power-
   116	reduction features, power management features, cost-reduction features,
   117	and architectural optimizations. 
   118	
   119	Major R4300i characteristics include 64-bit processing, 100-MHz internal 
   120	pipeline clock frequency, low-voltage operation, power-saving modes,
   121	plastic packaging, and a single data path for integer and floating-
   122	point operations. The R4300i implements the MIPS-III instruction 
   123	set architecture and is fully software compatible with all existing 
   124	MIPS processors. Chapter 3 provides a complete description of architectural 
   125	enhancements in the R4300i over previous MIPS microprocessor families 
   126	and other R4000 family members. 
   127	R4300i Family
   128	
   129	
   130	The R4300i is the first member of a family of microprocessors. The 
   131	R4300i family uses high integration, power management and virtual 
   132	memory implementation to bring high performance and low cost to the 
   133	consumer market. Future R4300i family members are planned to increase 
   134	the options available to systems developers. 
   135	
   136	The R4300i has been designed in well-defined basic blocks to simplify 
   137	implementation of the R4300i core logic in new products. For example,
   138	by removing the caches, memory-management unit, and system interface,
   139	a high-performance RISC core is available for integration in a derivative 
   140	processor or ASIC. 
   141	Packaging and Design Support
   142	
   143	
   144	The R4300i will be made available in a single 120-pin PQFP package. 
   145	
   146	
   147	The 120-pin plastic quad flat pack (PQFP) offers a low-cost package 
   148	for surface-mount assembly, decreasing processor cost further to 
   149	benefit embedded applications, and with a low profile suitable for 
   150	consumer applications. 
   151	Future Upgrades
   152	
   153	
   154	It is anticipated that higher frequency versions of the R4300i will 
   155	become available in the future. These will provide an extra performance 
   156	boost at the same low price points as the current R4300i. 
   157	Chapter 3. Implementation 
   158	
   159	
   160	The R4300i differs from the R4000 family in four main categories. 
   161	These categories, discussed in the next sections, are:- 
   162	
   163	
   164	ÿÿÿ[*]Power reduction features 
   165	ÿÿÿ[*]Power management features 
   166	ÿÿÿ[*]Cost reduction features 
   167	ÿÿÿ[*]Architectural optimization 
   168	ÿÿÿ[*]System bus interface 
   169	
   170	
   171	These features combine to achieve typical power dissipation of 1.8 
   172	watts, a reduced power mode dissipation of 0.4 watts, and a power-
   173	down mode where the processor is turned off. These features also 
   174	allow a die size of less than 7mm on a side, while maintaining full 
   175	64-bit operation. 
   176	Power Reduction Features
   177	
   178	
   179	The R4300i is designed using low-power design techniques. These are 
   180	techniques that reduce power dissipation while running standard tasks. 
   181	
   182	
   183	Examples of low-power design techniques, discussed below, are: 
   184	
   185	
   186	ÿÿÿ[*]3.3-Volt operation 
   187	ÿÿÿ[*]Dynamic logic design 
   188	ÿÿÿ[*]Cache bank partitioning 
   189	ÿÿÿ[*]Write-back data cache 
   190	ÿÿÿ[*]Cache prefetching 
   191	ÿÿÿ[*]Micro TLB 
   192	
   193	
   194	3.3-Volt operation
   195	
   196	
   197	The R4300i was designed for operation at 3.3V to reduce power consumption. 
   198	
   199	
   200	CMOS power dissipation increases with the square of potential difference 
   201	between power (VDD) and ground (VSS). At lower voltage levels, however,
   202	the threshold voltage at which a logic signal switches between zero 
   203	to one changes. Redesign of the gate's physical width-to-length ratio 
   204	is necessary to maintain logic speed at lower voltages; that slightly 
   205	increases total power dissipation. In sum, reducing the rail-to-rail 
   206	voltage difference by 1.7 volts reduces overall comparative power 
   207	dissipation to about 70%. 
   208	
   209	A lower rail-to-rail (VDD to VSS) voltage difference also increases 
   210	the chip's sensitivity to electrical noise, as there is a smaller 
   211	noise margin around the threshold voltage. MTI designed the R4300i 
   212	interface using low-voltage CMOS (LVCMOS) characterization to ensure 
   213	noise immunity and reliable signal operation. 
   214	Dynamic logic design
   215	
   216	
   217	The R4300i uses dynamic rather than static logic design to reduce 
   218	transistor count and power dissipation. The R4300i 's power management 
   219	functions make the dynamic logic design approach suitable for use 
   220	in consumer applications. 
   221	Cache bank partitioning
   222	
   223	
   224	Most instruction and data cache accesses exhibit spatial and temporal 
   225	locality of reference. In the R4300i, the instruction and data caches 
   226	are each split into four banks; only one of the four banks in the 
   227	instruction or data caches is powered up at any one time. This saves 
   228	power on every cache access cycle. 
   229	
   230	There is no performance degradation on cache bank misses; enabling 
   231	of cache banks is entirely transparent to system operation. 
   232	Write-back cache
   233	
   234	
   235	The R4300i uses a write-back policy for write operations. In a write-
   236	back policy, data in the cache is written to the main memory only 
   237	when the cache line is replaced. Cache lines can be replaced whenever 
   238	new data from a different address is to be loaded into the cache 
   239	or if the cache line is invalidated. 
   240	
   241	A write-back cache policy reduces store activity on the system bus,
   242	which improves system performance and simplifies memory subsystem 
   243	design. 
   244	Cache prefetching
   245	
   246	
   247	As instruction reads are usually sequential, the R4300i fetches two 
   248	consecutive 32-bit words (instructions) every time it reads the instruction 
   249	cache. Dual instruction access from the cache reduces the frequency 
   250	of cache enabling for instruction access, which reduces power dissipation. 
   251	
   252	TLB and Micro Instruction-TLB
   253	
   254	
   255	The memory management unit (MMU) translates virtual addresses to 
   256	physical addresses by looking up address correspondences in a "page 
   257	table". The processor maintains a complete page table in main 
   258	memory, but accesses to main memory are slow. The translation lookaside 
   259	buffer (TLB) keeps copies of page table entries on-chip, which accelerates 
   260	virtual-to-physical address translation. 
   261	
   262	The TLB structure is large and consumes power when enabled. The R4300i 
   263	therefore includes a "micro TLB" on chip which contains 
   264	page table entries for the two most recently referenced instruction 
   265	pages. 
   266	Power Management Features
   267	
   268	
   269	The R4300i also has built-in power management features in addition 
   270	to power reduction features. Power management is used when peak performance 
   271	is not required and it allows the processor to operate in different 
   272	modes. These modes require less power and therefore reduce average 
   273	power consumption over a period of time. The power management modes 
   274	, discussed below, are:- 
   275	
   276	
   277	ÿÿÿ[*]Standard operating mode 
   278	ÿÿÿ[*]Sleep mode 
   279	ÿÿÿ[*]Power-down mode 
   280	
   281	
   282	Standard operating mode
   283	
   284	
   285	In this mode the processor operates at a maximum of 100 MHz pipeline 
   286	speed and 50 MHz external interface speed. Power dissipation at maximum 
   287	frequency in this mode is estimated at 1.8 watts. 
   288	Sleep mode
   289	
   290	
   291	This feature allows the processor to change dynamically to one quarter 
   292	of the normal speed. For example, if the pipeline operates normally 
   293	at 100 Mhz, it would operate at 25 Mhz in sleep mode. Typically, 
   294	chipset logic triggers this mode when it detects no user activity 
   295	over some pre-determined amount of time(such as between keystrokes 
   296	or mouse movements). In reduced power mode, power dissipation falls 
   297	to 0.4 Watts, one quarter of the normal. 
   298	Power-down mode
   299	
   300	
   301	In the R4300i, all variable registers are both readable and writable. 
   302	On power-down, the state of the processor can therefore be written 
   303	to non-volatile RAM. On power-up, the registers can be restored to 
   304	the same state. 
   305	
   306	This "instant-on" capability allows the processor to be 
   307	activated in milliseconds, instead of the many seconds normally required 
   308	to boot an operating system. This not only reduces power consumption 
   309	but is a power saving benefit for consumers. 
   310	Cost Reduction Features
   311	
   312	
   313	The R4300i is designed for low cost. The main areas contributing 
   314	to microprocessor cost are packaging, test and assembly, and die 
   315	costs. 
   316	Packaging cost reduction
   317	
   318	
   319	For low cost applications, the R4300i will be available in a 120-
   320	pin plastic quad flat package (PQFP). High-performance microprocessors 
   321	normally require expensive ceramic or metal packages with enhanced 
   322	thermal dissipation because of their higher power requirements. 
   323	The reduction in the system bus width from 64 bits to 32 bits and 
   324	elimination of some control signals resulted in a low pin-count package 
   325	offering. Lower power dissipation facilitated the use of plastic 
   326	packages. 
   327	Test & assembly cost reduction
   328	
   329	
   330	The R4300i implements column redundancy in both instruction and data 
   331	caches. Column redundancy reduces the chip's sensitivity to defects 
   332	in the caches. 
   333	
   334	The test process first tests the integrity of each bit column in 
   335	the cache; polysilicon fuses in the chip are then blown to swap redundant 
   336	bit columns for defective bit columns. 
   337	
   338	Column redundancy increases the die yield at the test stage, which 
   339	in turn decreases testing costs for each good die. 
   340	Die cost reduction
   341	
   342	
   343	The die area was reduced by the following techniques: 
   344	
   345	
   346	ÿÿÿHigh-density 0.35 micron design rules 
   347	ÿÿÿUse of 4-transistor RAM cells in the caches 
   348	ÿÿÿUnified CPU/FPU data path 
   349	ÿÿÿReduced configurability 
   350	ÿÿÿOptimized cache and TLB size 
   351	
   352	
   353	The last three cost reduction strategies fall in the category of 
   354	architectural optimizations, discussed below. 
   355	Architectural Optimizations
   356	
   357	
   358	The R4300i fully implements the current ISA, MIPS-III standard. 
   359	
   360	As in all the MIPS R3000 and R4000 processors, an on-chip CP0 coprocessor 
   361	contains an MMU for virtual address translation and exception processing 
   362	control. The system address/data bus interface is different from 
   363	the R4000 series processors. The R4300i has a 32-bit multiplexed 
   364	address/data bus and a 5-bit command bus. A flush buffer, which 
   365	was added to the R4400 for increased graphics performance, is retained 
   366	in the R4300i. 
   367	
   368	The R4300i also includes on-chip clock frequency division circuitry 
   369	to support internal 100-MHz operation from an external 50-MHz clock. 
   370	The R4300i has the option of operating internally at 1, 1.5, 2 or 
   371	3 times the frequency of the external clock. In addition, the R4300i 
   372	eliminates RClock that existed in the R4000. The output clocks SyncOut 
   373	and TClock can be turned off for power savings. This allows high 
   374	microprocessor performance and also simplifies system design. 
   375	
   376	The differences from the R4000, discussed below, are: 
   377	
   378	
   379	ÿÿÿ[*]Combined integer/floating-point data path 
   380	ÿÿÿ[*]Optimized 5-stage pipeline 
   381	ÿÿÿ[*]Optimized cache and TLB size 
   382	ÿÿÿ[*]Reduced physical address space 
   383	ÿÿÿ[*]Additional instruction trace support 
   384	ÿÿÿ[*]Simplified processor initialization 
   385	
   386	
   387	Unified integer/floating-point data path
   388	
   389	
   390	The R4300i's integer unit shares its data path with the FPU unit. 
   391	CPU and floating-point instructions are both executed in the same 
   392	5-stage pipeline. This represents a considerable saving in die area 
   393	and corresponding power dissipation. 
   394	Optimized pipeline
   395	
   396	
   397	Pipelining allows multiple instructions to overlap during execution 
   398	for greater throughput. All processor operations require five basic 
   399	operations: instruction fetch, instruction decode, instruction execution,
   400	accessing data and writing of the results. These operations can be 
   401	split up over a pipeline so that several instructions can be treated 
   402	concurrently: while one instruction is being decoded, another can 
   403	be fetched, and so on. 
   404	
   405	The R4300i uses a five-stage pipeline instead of the eight-stage 
   406	pipeline found in the R4000 series processors. The eight-stage pipeline 
   407	allows the R4000 series processors to reach higher speeds. However,
   408	the shorter pipeline achieves greater efficiency at a given speed 
   409	than its longer counterpart. Loads, stores, jumps and branches are 
   410	resolved in fewer cycles, and exception processing is simplified. 
   411	Less control logic means reduced die area. 
   412	Optimized cache and TLB size
   413	
   414	
   415	The R4300i uses separate instruction and data caches. Instruction 
   416	cache size impacts performance to a greater extent owing to locality 
   417	of instruction code. The combination of 16-Kbytes instruction cache 
   418	and 8-Kbytes data cache gives optimum performance for a fixed total 
   419	cache size. The on-chip TLB is also reduced from the 48 entry-pairs 
   420	in the R4000 to 32 entry-pairs. These sizes have been selected after 
   421	extensive simulation to give the R4300i the best trade-off between 
   422	high performance and small die area. TLBs are very critical in implementing 
   423	virtual memory systems. In consumer applications such as settops,
   424	the existence of TLBs allow for implementation of security as well 
   425	as fast context switching times when running multiple processes. 
   426	In addition, virtual page sizes from 4KB, 16KB, 64KB, 256KB, 1MB,
   427	4MB, and 16MB are supported just as in the R4000 series processors. 
   428	
   429	Reduced physical address space
   430	
   431	
   432	The physical address space has been reduced from 36 bits to 32 bits. 
   433	This still supports a physical address range of 4 Gbytes, more than 
   434	enough for consumer applications. 
   435	Additional instruction trace support
   436	
   437	
   438	The R4300i includes an additional debugging mode called instruction 
   439	trace support. This mode lets the user find out the physical address 
   440	to which the CPU has branched or jumped whenever a branch, jump, 
   441	or exception is taken. 
   442	Simplified processor initialization
   443	
   444	
   445	Processor initialization has been simplified, reflecting the lower 
   446	degree of configurability. The R4300i has two hardware pins for configuration 
   447	during the reset initialization sequence and a configuration register 
   448	in CP0 is used to set other options such as data rate or endianess.

   453	The main benefits of the R4300i, discussed below, are: 
   454	
   455	
   456	ÿÿÿ[*]Price/Performance 
   457	ÿÿÿ[*]Low Power 
   458	ÿÿÿ[*]Low Cost 
   459	ÿÿÿ[*]Compatibility 
   460	
   461	
   462	Price/Performance
   463	
   464	
   465	The R4300i dramatically improves price/performance for both system 
   466	designers and end-users. 
   467	
   468	The R4300i achieves price/performance over ten times better than 
   469	existing microprocessors. The R4300i will be the first commercially 
   470	available processor to deliver less than $1/SPECint mark in 1995. 
   471	
   472	Low Power
   473	
   474	
   475	The R4300i was specifically designed for high-performance consumer 
   476	applications by including reduced power and power management features. 
   477	
   478	
   479	ÿÿÿReduced-power features are those that perform traditional tasks 
   480	ÿÿÿin a way that reduces power consumption. 
   481	ÿÿÿPower management features are architectural enhancements that 
   482	ÿÿÿfurther reduce internal and system-wide power consumption through 
   483	ÿÿÿswitching modes. 
   484	
   485	
   486	The combination of reduced-power and power-management features allows 
   487	the R4300i to fit in an inexpensive plastic package. 
   488	Low Cost
   489	
   490	
   491	In practice, good price/performance usually means increased performance 
   492	at a given price point. The R4300i, in contrast, brings existing 
   493	high-performance levels to an unprecedented low price-point. 
   494	
   495	System manufacturers can decrease component costs, thereby increasing 
   496	margins, or offer their products at a lower price, thereby stimulating 
   497	demand. 
   498	
   499	Price-sensitive consumer applications such as games and interactive 
   500	television benefit particularly from a low cost, high-speed microprocessor. 
   501	Factory automation and robotics are also likely applications for 
   502	the R4300i. 
   503	Compatibility
   504	
   505	
   506	Software compatibility is a fundamental requirement to preserve investments 
   507	in software over time. 
   508	
   509	All MIPS processors maintain software compatibility. A program compiled 
   510	and linked to run on the R3000 processor will run on the R4300i. 
   511

   513	Appendix A. Glossary
   514	
   515	
   516	Cache. An on-chip temporary storage area containing a copy of main 
   517	memory fragments. Cache access is much faster than main memory access. 
   518	
   519	
   520	CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing). A design approach that 
   521	attempts to achieve performance gains with complex instruction and 
   522	data types and hardware controlled memory management. 
   523	
   524	CPU (Central Processing Unit). The part of a microprocessor where 
   525	the majority of the instructions are executed. 
   526	
   527	Die. The silicon chip after it has been cut from a wafer and before 
   528	it has been packaged. 
   529	
   530	Flush Buffer (also called a write buffer). The flush buffer is a 
   531	temporary storage location for data that is being written from the 
   532	pipeline or cache to main memory. The flush buffer allows the processor 
   533	to continue executing instructions while data is being written to 
   534	main memory. 
   535	
   536	FPU (Floating-Point Unit). Dedicated logic to accelerate calculations 
   537	using floating-point numbers. 
   538	
   539	IU (Integer Unit). The part of a CPU that performs calculations using 
   540	integer arithmetic. 
   541	
   542	LVCMOS (Low-voltage CMOS). An IEEE standard for low-voltage logic 
   543	design. 
   544	
   545	MMU (Memory Management Unit). That part of a microprocessor which 
   546	implements virtual-to-physical address translation and the memory 
   547	system hierarchy including cache memory. 
   548	
   549	MTI (MIPS Technologies, Inc.). The developer of the MIPS RISC architecture,
   550	the leading RISC architecture worldwide. 
   551	
   552	Page Table. An area of main memory containing sets of virtual addresses 
   553	with their corresponding physical addresses and protection data. 
   554	
   555	
   556	RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing). A design philosophy that 
   557	avoids implementing complex functions in silicon but realizes large 
   558	performance increases through executing simpler, standardized instructions 
   559	at faster, more efficient rates. 
   560	
   561	Pipeline. A mechanism to allow multiple instructions to overlap during 
   562	execution for greater throughput. A five-stage pipeline offers peak 
   563	performance five times that of a non-pipelined processor. 
   564	
   565	PQFP (Plastic Quad Flat Pack). A plastic package with pins on the 
   566	four edges, cheaper than a CPGA. 
   567	
   568	TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer). An on-chip "page table" 
   569	cache containing copies of the page tables used by the MMU for virtual-
   570	to-physical address translation. 
   571	
   572	64-bit Processor. A processor in which all address and data paths 
   573	are 64 bits wide. Leading-edge applications require 64-bit processors 
   574	today. 32-bit capability in a 64-bit processor is important to manage 
   575	the smooth transition from 32 to 64 bits. The MIPS R4000, R4400 and 
   576	R4300i MPUs can run in either 32-bit or 64-bit mode.
