     5	SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Feb. 16, 1995  -- Intel Corporation today 
     6	disclosed details of the first fruit of a parallel engineering effort, 
     7	the next-generation P6 microprocessor, at an engineering conference here. 
     8	The presentation of technical details follows the delivery of first 
     9	working samples to OEMs.
    10		
    11		The 5.5-million transistor chip will deliver the highest level of 
    12	processor performance for the Intel Architecture when systems using the chip 
    13	begin to ship in the second half of this year.  P6 will achieve this 
    14	performance using a unique combination of technologies known as Dynamic 
    15	Execution.
    16		
    17		P6 microarchitecture details were presented by Intel at the IEEE 
    18	International Solid State Circuits Conference (ISSCC), an annual industry 
    19	gathering where technical innovations are showcased and discussed.  Details 
    20	on P6's unique approach to high-performance processing, described collectively 
    21	as Dynamic Execution, were presented by Dr. Robert Colwell, P6 architecture 
    22	manager, at ISSCC.
    23		
    24		Colwell explained that this architectural enhancement is the next step 
    25	beyond the superscalar advance implemented in the Pentium(R) processor. 
    26	Dynamic Execution is a combination of technologies -- multiple branch 
    27	prediction, data flow analysis and speculative execution -- that is 
    28	constantly feeding P6's data-crunching units.  Intel engineers were able to 
    29	implement Dynamic Execution by analyzing how billions of lines of code in 
    30	software programs are typically executed by processors.  Collectively, these 
    31	technologies allow the P6 to operate as an efficient information factory.
    32		
    33		Multiple branch prediction increases the amount of work available 
    34	for the microprocessor to execute.  Data flow analysis schedules the 
    35	instructions to be executed when ready, independent of the original program 
    36	order.  Speculative execution allows the P6 to keep its superscalar engine 
    37	as busy as possible by executing instructions that are likely to be needed.
    38		
    39		With these technologies, the P6 can efficiently analyze much larger 
    40	sections of incoming program flow than any previous PC processor, swiftly 
    41	allocate internal resources, and intelligently optimize work that can be 
    42	done in parallel.  Consequently, more data can be processed in a given time 
    43	period.

    45	Parallel Design Teams Learn From Each Other
    46		
    47		The concept of P6's Dynamic Execution engine began in 1990, when 
    48	today's mainstream Pentium(R) processor was still just a software simulation. 
    49		
    50		"Intel's use of parallel engineering teams for chip design has 
    51	compressed delivery cycles of new generations of chips, cutting the time 
    52	about in half," said Albert Yu, senior vice president and general manager, 
    53	Microprocessor Products Group.  "As a result, computer users will have some 
    54	of the most powerful, low-cost engines at hand to enrich the desktop with 
    55	software and other capabilities we only imagined five years ago," he said.
    56		
    57		Yu said the Oregon-based P6 design team, building on the knowledge 
    58	gained from the Pentium processor design, embarked on an innovative 
    59	system-level solution to the next-generation processor involving the 
    60	processor, cache (high-speed supporting memory), and bus (the transport 
    61	mechanism that keeps data flowing into and out of the processor).  "This 
    62	approach will ensure that computers built around P6 will be able to take 
    63	advantage of the chip's processing power when it is introduced as a 
    64	commercial product later this year," he said.
    65		
    66		The system-level approach means the P6 will be the first high-volume 
    67	microprocessor with two die in a single package.  A dual-cavity, standard 
    68	PGA package contains a P6 die and a companion level two (L2) cache die.  
    69	The two chips communicate using a highly-optimized bus which contributes 
    70	to high performance by tightly-coupling the processor to its primary 
    71	data source.
    72	
    73	Additional Features
    74		
    75		In addition to providing new levels of performance, the P6 will contain 
    76	new features which will greatly simplify the design of multiprocessor systems 
    77	and improve overall system reliability.  Among applications that will benefit 
    78	greatly from this processing power are: desktop applications such as image 
    79	processing, speech recognition, software-only videoconferencing and 
    80	multimedia authoring, and server applications such as transaction and 
    81	database processing.
    82		
    83		At introduction in the second half of this year, the P6 processor 
    84	will operate at 133 MHz and will use a power supply of 2.9 volts.  The 
    85	low voltage also contributes to low power dissipation, which is expected 
    86	to be only about 14 watts, typically, for the processor and L2 cache combined.
    87	Complete performance and power dissipation information will also be available 
    88	at that time, although estimated performance has been measured at more than 
    89	200 SPECint92 on a prototype system, twice the performance of today's fastest 
    90	Pentium processor. 
    91	
    92		Intel, the world's largest chip maker, is also a leading manufacturer 
    93	of personal computer, networking and communications products.
