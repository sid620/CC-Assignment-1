     2	                         The DOS 6 HELP
     3	       
     4	       DOS 6 has greatly improved help information.  To get a short
     5	       explanation and overview of DOS commands, at the DOS prompt
     6	       type:
     7	                           fasthelp <ENTER>
     8	       
     9	       If you want to access a table of contents for DOS HELP, at the
    10	       DOS prompt type:
    11	       
    12	                           help <ENTER>
    13	       
    14	       Then press the first letter of the command on which you would
    15	       like more information.  Use your arrow keys to make your
    16	       selection.  When the cursor is on the command where you want
    17	       help, press:
    18	       
    19	                           <ENTER>
    20	       
    21	       To get detailed information on any particular DOS command, at
    22	       the system prompt type HELP followed by a space and the
    23	       command that you want information on.  For example, if you want
    24	       help on the DIR command, type:
    25	        
    26	                           help dir <ENTER>
    27	       
    28	       A screen of information is shown with Notes and Examples at the
    29	       top.  Press N for Notes or E for Examples.  The cursor will then
    30	       go to the one you selected.  Then press:
    31	       
    32	                           <ENTER>
    33	       
    34	       You can use your arrow keys to scroll through the text.  You can
    35	       also press <PGDN> or <PGUP> to scroll one page at a time. 
    36	       If you select E for Examples, you are shown actual examples of
    37	       how to use the command. If you want to search for a key word or
    38	       phrase, you can start the search process by pressing:
    39	       
    40	                           <ALT> 
    41	                           s
    42	       
    43	       Then just follow the screen prompts.
    44

    46	                        Printing HELP Information
    47	       
    48	       You can print the HELP information you are viewing by pressing:
    49	       
    50	                           <ALT>
    51	                           f
    52	                           p
    53	                           <ENTER>
    54	                 
    55	       I recommend printing the help information, so you can have a
    56	       copy to use beside your computer.  If you do this for all the DOS
    57	       commands, you can print your own personalized DOS manual!
