     5	           FRICC POLICY ON INTERCONNECTIVITY AND RESOURCE SHARING
     6	
     7	
     8	Within the participating government agencies of the Federal Research 
     9	
    10	Internet Coordinating Committee (FRICC), there exist today varying policies 
    11	
    12	on the acceptable use of each agency's networking resources.  This policy 
    13	
    14	statement set forth by the FRICC will establish both a short-term and 
    15	
    16	longer-term policy agreed to by the FRICC participating members.  Mid-level 
    17	
    18	networks that use FRICC shared resources must conform to this policy.
    19	
    20	
    21	
    22	For the short term, the FRICC policy is relatively simple and is primarily 
    23	
    24	motivated by the cost savings to the Federal government.  This policy will 
    25	
    26	be in effect from mid fiscal year 1989 through fiscal year 1991.
    27	
    28	
    29	
    30	     1.   The member agencies of the FRICC agree to share the use of network 
    31	
    32	          data links, both domestic and foreign, whenever possible.  This 
    33	
    34	          will include the gatewaying of major backbone resources of the 
    35	
    36	          participating agencies within the continental United States.
    37	
    38	
    39	
    40	     2.   The member agencies of the FRICC agree to carry all traffic that 
    41	
    42	          meets the acceptable use policy of the originating member agency.  
    43	
    44	          In the least restrictive case, this includes all bona fide 
    45	
    46	          researchers and scholars, public and private, from the United 
    47	
    48	          States and foreign countries unless denied access by national 
    49	
    50	          policy.
    51	
    52	
    53	
    54	     3.   The member agencies of the FRICC will maintain the prerogative to 
    55	
    56	          limit or shut off the shared use of interconnected resources 
    57	
    58	          during periods when guaranteed bandwidth might be required by the 
    59	
    60	          proprietary agency.
    61	
    62	
    63	
    64	     4.   The FRICC will comply with OMB Circular A-130 through estimates of 
    65	
    66	          shared traffic and ongoing research and development enabling the 
    67	
    68	          identification and metering of traffic through gateways or other 
    69	
    70	          means.
    71	
    72	
    73	For the long term, the FRICC policy is a transition to a National Research 
    74	
    75	Network to be operated commercially.  The FRICC will support the research 
    76	
    77	and development required for the administrative policy controls and counting 
    78	
    79	mechanisms that will make this transition possible.
