     1	BATON ROUGE, La., Nov. 18, 1991 -- Fifth Generation Systems, Inc., today
     2	introduced Untouchable, a new line of anti-virus software that provides
     3	complete virus protection without the need for frequent virus signature
     4	updates. Untouchable stand-alone and network products are designed to
     5	operate on DOS-based PCs, compatibles and networks.
     6	
     7	Four features distinguish the Untouchable product line from other
     8	anti-virus software products on the market:
     9	
    10	o a revolutionary product design which eliminates the need 
    11	  for frequent virus signature updates;
    12	
    13	o a patented virus removal technique that guarantees 
    14	  100 percent restoration of recoverable infected files,
    15	  including those hit by unknown viruses;
    16	
    17	o automatic, load-and-forget protection that ensures the
    18	  integrity of data without interfering with the work 
    19	  process; and
    20	
    21	o a network version that provides centralized installation
    22	  and management capabilities.
    23	
    24	"Untouchable sets the standard for the next generation of anti-virus
    25	software," said Barry L. Bellue, Sr., president and CEO of Fifth
    26	Generation Systems. "This is the virus protection software that corporate
    27	America has been waiting for," he continued. "It is nearly impossible to
    28	get 40,000 users at a large corporation to update their software every
    29	three months. With Untouchable, they will have total protection against
    30	all existing and future viruses, even if they never buy virus signature
    31	updates."
    32	
    33	PRODUCT DESIGN
    34	
    35	Untouchable consists of three distinct anti-virus technologies that
    36	constantly interact to detect and eradicate known and unknown viruses.
    37	
    38	The heart of Untouchable's detection capabilities is the file scanner,
    39	which incorporates the principal of modification detection. This
    40	mathematically-proven technique safeguards against known and unknown virus
    41	threats by making unique use of file signatures rather than the
    42	commonly-used virus signatures.
    43	
    44	During installation, Untouchable fingerprints and registers all files on
    45	the PC, using proprietary file signature calculations, and stores the
    46	information in encrypted on-line and off-line databases. Every day,
    47	Untouchable automatically performs an integrity test of the user's files
    48	and compares the results of this check to the information initially stored
    49	in the database.
    50	
    51	If a virus is detected, Untouchable uses the database of file signatures as
    52	a reference to reconstruct infected files to their former. "healthy"
    53	state. Since the removal methodology does not rely on virus signatures,
    54	Untouchable can safely restore files struck by an unknown virus.
    55	
    56	"No other product available today can offer this degree of protection or
    57	guarantee 100 percent safe restoration of recoverable files," said
    58	Bellue.
    59	
    60	As a first line of defense, Untouchable uses a TSR monitor that checks
    61	system memory for known boot sector and partition table viruses. Once
    62	loaded into memory, it is always on guard against known viruses, scanning
    63	each file before execution and checking every diskette inserted into the
    64	floppy drive. Running completely in the background, the TSR monitor
    65	occupies less than 900 bytes (.9K) when loaded into expanded memory or 5K
    66	if fully loaded in conventional memory.
    67	
    68	Untouchable's second line of defense is a virus scanner/remover that can
    69	detect and eradicate hundreds of known viruses. The virus scanner is
    70	automatically run during program installation to verify a clean
    71	environment and is automatically launched to check all new files and
    72	programs for viruses before they are added to the database of file
    73	signatures. The scanner can be manually run from the command line to check
    74	floppy disks before use. If the scanner detects a known virus, it will
    75	restore recoverable files to their original state.
    76	
    77	UNTOUCHABLE NETWORK
    78	
    79	Untouchable Network provides Novell LAN administrators with the ability to
    80	centrally monitor and control the entire network for viruses.
    81	
    82	The program uses the same methods of protection as the stand-alone version,
    83	but incorporates enhanced LAN management features, including:
    84	
    85	o automatic installation and updating from one location;
    86	
    87	o transparent, unobtrusive operation at the workstation
    88	
    89	o ultimate control over the way the program operates 
    90	  on every node;
    91	
    92	o real-time virus alert mechanisms;
    93	
    94	o ongoing status reports on the state of the network 
    95	  from one central control panel;
    96	
    97	o historical logs of all status reports and virus 
    98	  alerts; and
    99	
   100	o the ability to assign "system operators" who receive 
   101	  the same alert that workstations receive.
   102	
   103	Untouchable Network currently provides its enhanced LAN management
   104	facilities for the Novell Netware operating system. A network saw y
   105	version of the product, without the LAN management features, is available
   106	to run on Microsoft LAN Manager, Banyan Vines, 3Com and other PC network
   107	operating systems. Bellue said, "We will expand Untouchable Network's LAN
   108	management capabilities to other network operating systems."
   109	
   110	Untouchable will be available in mid-November at a suggested retail price
   111	of $165. An Untouchable Network Starter Kit is available at a suggested
   112	retail price of $695. The starter kit includes the server package of full
   113	supervisor documentation and software and ten node license agreements.
   114	License agreements for additional nodes may be purchased at a suggested
   115	retail price of $85 per node.
   116	
   117	While Untouchable does not require virus signature updates to ensure
   118	complete protection against undiscovered new viruses, Fifth Generation
   119	Systems recognizes that some users may want them. The company will provide
   120	quarterly virus signature updates for the virus scanner and TSR monitor,
   121	for a service charge of $15 per quarter.
   122	
   123	Fifth Generation Systems is one of the leading developers of DOS and
   124	macintosh utilities software for data security, with Untouchable for virus
   125	protection, DiskLock for access security and encryption, and FastBack Plus
   126	for data backup. The privately-held firm also develops software for
   127	menuing/file management and recovery.
