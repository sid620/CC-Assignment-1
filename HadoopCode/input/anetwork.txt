     2	        This program is an attempt to try to make a very simple
     3	ST to ST link. The main objective was to make it as transparent as
     4	possible to the user and to other programs. 
     5

     7	                LOADING AND SETUP
     8	
     9	        ANET uses three user vectors starting at $200 and the drivemap
    10	located at $4C2. A reset using the reset buttom sometimes does not
    11	clear the lower system memory so if this program is resident you must
    12	use a cold start "power off and power on" or a reboot program for it to
    13	be reloaded correctly when you run the ANETWORK.PRG or ANETCTRL.PRG after
    14	the reboot. The ANETCTRL.PRG has a reboot selection on the MENU.
    15	
    16	    Double-click on the ANETWORK.PRG to load the resident program then
    17	double-click on the ANETCTRL.PRG to load the control program. After the
    18	first load you can usually load both the resident and control programs by
    19	running ANETCTRL.PRG after a reboot.
    20	 
    21	     ONLY LOAD THE ANETWORK.PRG IF YOU GET A MODULA-2 ERROR 
    22	TRYING TO RUN ANETCTRL.PRG FIRST. AS IT WILL LOAD THE ANETWORK.PRG FOR YOU.
    23	
    24	        The control program lets you set the baud rate, reboot the ST,
    25	reset the network message sequence count, turn the network on and off,
    26	see which ICONS to install to use the remote disks and of course to quit
    27	the control program. The NEW command on the sequence MENU is to resync
    28	the remote program if it gets out of sync due to a reboot, hang or and
    29	error condition. Click the mouse on NEW to send a resync command to the
    30	remote and try to access the ICON again.
    31	        MAKE INT on the mode MENU will make a network setup file called
    32	ANETWORK.INT that ANETWORK.PRG reads to set the baud rate and to turn
    33	the netork on or off. ANETCTRL.PRG also reads the INT file when it is
    34	loaded and uses the parameters to set up the menu values. Clicking the 
    35	pointer on MAKE INT will save the current menu values on the ANETCTRL.PRG 
    36	menu to a new ANETWORK.INT file.
    37	
    38	        To load the dial menu make a file called ANETWORK.DIL. It can
    39	have up to 16 entrys for phone numbers. Each entry must be terminated with
    40	a RETURN. If you have a HAYES modem enter the dial code, the number, a
    41	space, then the name of the service or person.
    42	
    43	Example:   
    44	ATDT696-0060 genie
    45	ATDT691-7862 CIS
    46	 
    47	
    48	
    49	                USE
    50	
    51	        Install the ICONS on the GEM DESKTOP for the remote system drive(s)
    52	you wish to access, then just use them just like any other disk drive. Due
    53	to the slower serial access it is usally better to copy the file a local
    54	disk if you wish to edit or run the file. Every effort has been made to
    55	make sure it is error free but I would only use it to read from the remote
    56	rather that sending files due to a crash may cause disk file links to be
    57	lost while creating new files on the remote system.
    58	
    59	
    60	        You need a crossover cable for the ST to ST connection.
    61	                          like this.
    62	local                                                 remote
