     1	The following is an exerpt from a text file written/complied by one
     2	A.D. Longton of Rockville, MD. I have omitted the discussion of how
     3	to make a 1.44M disk from a 720K disk with a soldering iron since I
     4	don't want to be a party to furthering that practice. I did, however,
     5	find the remainder of the information quite interesting and have 
     6	included it here. As You can see, it comes directly from the 
     7	'brain trust' at Big Blue and may tend to lend some measure of credibility
     8	to what I've been saying all along. The original file was dated 5/10/89,
     9	I'm not sure when the information spewed forth from Boca Raton.

    26	     "The  original recommendations about the proper formatting and use
    27	     of  PS/2 diskettes have undergone revision.  This article explains
    28	     why the recommendations have changed.
    29	
    30	                            THE ORIGINAL CAUTION
    31	
    32	     Personal  System/2 shipping cartons include a sheet of paper  that
    33	     cautions  users not to format a 2.0 MB diskette to 720 KB, because
    34	     the diskette becomes unusable and should be discarded.
    35	
    36	     This  caution was issued because of the physical properties of 720
    37	     KB  diskettes versus 1.44 MB diskettes.  The 720 KB format uses  a
    38	     higher  write current, and the  1.44 MB format uses a lower  write
    39	     current.   To  accommodate  the  higher write current,  the  oxide
    40	     coating on a 1.0 MB (720 KB formatted) diskette is denser than the
    41	     oxide coating on a 2.0 MB (1.44 MB formatted) diskette.
    42	
    43	     When  you format a 2.0 MB diskette to 720 KB, you apply the higher
    44	     write  current  to  the  less dense oxide coating.   The  hardware
    45	     developers  originally felt that this meant the 720 KB  formatting
    46	     pattern  is  written too  deeply  into the 2.0 MB  oxide  coating,
    47	     causing intermittent data errors and unreliable use.  Furthermore,
    48	     the developers felt that if you attempted to reformat the diskette
    49	     to 1.44 MB, which uses the lower write current, the 1.44 MB format
    50	     would  not  completely  write  over  the "deeper" 720  KB  format.
    51	     Therefore  the developers' recommendation was to discard a 2.0  MB
    52	     diskette that was formatted to 720 KB.
    53	
    54	                          THE SUBSEQUENT FINDINGS
    55	                             [aka a RETRACTION]
    56	
    57	     Since  the time that this caution was issued, the developers  have
    58	     performed  additional testing, and have concluded that there is no
    59	     need to discard a 2.0 MB diskette that was formatted to 720 KB.
    60	
    61	     It  is still true that a  2.0 MB diskette formated to 720 KB  will
    62	     cause intermittent data errors.  However, the latest assessment is
    63	     that  you will be able to reformat the diskette to 1.44 MB and use
    64	     it reliably after that.
    65	
    66	     The  same logic applies to a 1.0 MB diskette formatted to 1.44 MB.
    67	     You cannot use it with the 1.44 MB format, but you can reformat it
    68	     to 720 KB and use it reliably after that.
    69	
    70	     Therefore,   the  current  recommendation  is:  If  you  format  a
    71	     diskettte  to  the  wrong  capacity, do not discard  it;  instead,
    72	     reformat it correctly and use it."
    73	
    74	
    75	     With  all those feelings  and recomendations on those feelings  it
    76	     makes  me wonder how much experimentation was actually being  done
    77	     on  a  strictly scientific level.   Note that the one  mention  of
    78	     formatting  1.0mb disks to 1.44 MB does not say that you will  get
    79	     errors  if you use them.  What it does say is that if you reformat
    80	     that  wrongly formatted disk, you can reliably use it at 720  KB.
    81	     The  implication is that since there were errors with 2.0mb  disks
    82	     formatted  to 720 KB "logic applies" that there will be errors  if
    83	     the  reverse is done.  This is not necessarly the case, and we are
    84	     not told why, we are just told.
    85	
    86	     FYI, here are the specifications for the 720 KB, 1.44 MB, and 360k
    87	     5.25"  disk  drives  as  listed  in the same issue on pages 43-44.
    88	     Note the large similarity between 360k and 720 KB disks and 720 KB
    89	     disks and 1.44 MB disks.
