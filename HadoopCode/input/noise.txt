     2	         Line Noise and the Problems it Can Cause with File Transfers
     3	
     4	     Many people have left messages on my bulletin board asking me why there
     5	are so many 'garbage' characters on their screens and why file transfers are
     6	riddled with errors.  These garbage characters are really line noise and can
     7	be introduced in many different places.  One of the more common and familiar
     8	introduction points of line noise is in the telephone company's system and
     9	even here there are several ways noise is introduced.  A signal is routed
    10	through multiple stations before it eventually makes it to the other end and
    11	some of these stations aren't exactly new.  Older areas may have older, less
    12	sophisticated equipment that is more apt to be affected by ambient noise.
    13	This is one reason some people continue to have noise problems even after
    14	hanging up and calling back multiple times.  Also, a given physical connection
    15	
    16	
    17	at one of these junctions may not be up to snuff.  If your particular bout of
    18	line noise is solved by hanging up and calling back, then it's probable that
    19	you were previously connected through an intermittent or 'dirty' connection.
    20	Some of these trunk lines (large, multi-caller 'pipes') may pass through an
    21	area that has alot of ambient RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) present
    22	although this is not usually the case.
    23	
    24	    Another common noise introduction point is in your home.  Most residential
    25	homes have televisions, radios, microwave ovens, VCR's, and if you are reading
    26	this, a micro-computer.  All these devices radiate radio waves that can (and
    27	often do) get into the phone lines and cause noise.  Electric motors and
    28	mechanical dimmer controls can introduce noise into the electrical wiring in
    29	your house and cause problems.  If your line noise problem does not go away
    30	after repeated hanging up and calling back, then you may be suffering from one
    31	of these household problems.  If you are suffering from this problem, you can
    32	take steps to eliminate it.  First of all, turn off EVERTHING except the
    33	fridge (If it IS the fridge, then you're SOL.  Can't live life with your ice
    34	box unplugged) and see if the noise persists.  If it goes away, then start
    35	turning things back on, checking the computer each time until you see the
    36	noise start up again.  It may be that a single device is not bugging you but
    37	several devices plotting together to annoy you.  This elimination tournament
    38	may take awhile.
    39	
    40	    Another area to check is your wiring at the computer.  Use noise
    41	supressors on your power connections to both the PC and the modem (if
    42	external).  Use a shielded RS-232 cable to connect your modem to the PC.
    43	Ribbon cables (especailly long runs of it) are great antennas and will cause
    44	problems.  Re-route the RS-232 cable so it does not run next to the PC power
    45	supply or any other transformer.  Many 'clone' monitors do not have internal
    46	metal shielding and can radiate lots of noise.  Make sure the cable does not
    47	run near the monitor.  If you are particularly adventuresome, you can line the
    48	interior of the monitor with foil and ground it with a ribbon grounding strap.
    49	Be VERY CAREFUL if you attempt this.  Monitors generate THOUSANDS of volts of
    50	electricity and can knock you clear into next week.  You'd best NOT attempt
    51	this unless you are experienced in electronics.  If you live near a freeway or
    52	highway, then interference from CB radio can present a problem.  Many
    53	interstate truckers have 100+ watts of power (illegally) on their CB rigs and
    54	frequently have sloppy amplifiers that can emit spurious radition all over the
    55	radio spectrum.
    56	
    57	    And now a little discussion about the modem itself.  First of all, I'd
    58	like to clerify a commonly misused term - BAUD.  The term "Baud" is actually a
    59	man's name - J.M.E. Baudot (Pronounced:  Baw-doe) a French Telegraphy expert.
    60	1,200 and 2,400 Baud is NOT the same as 1,200 and 2,400 BPS (Bits Per Second).
    61	The usage of "Baud" to describe line speed in terms of data through-put is
    62	incorrect.  1,200 and 2,400 BPS modems both operate at 600 Baud.  Basically,
    63	without getting to technical, a Baud is a "blip" of information.  1,200 BPS
    64	modems use four states per blip (or Baud) and 2,400 BPS modems use sixteen
    65	states per blip.  If you want more information on what Baud and BPS mean and a
    66	full explanation of how data is actually represented and transferred by the
    67	modem, please refer to PC Magazine Volume 6, Number 9 (May 12, 1987).
    68	
    69	    Modems operating at 2,400 BPS are much more intolerant of line noise than
    70	are modems operating at 1,200 BPS.  Conversely, modems capable of 2,400 BPS
    71	operate better at 1,200 BPS than do 1,200 BPS only modems.  If you are being
    72	hopelessly attacked by noise at 2,400 BPS, trying calling back at 1,200 BPS.
    73	It's very possible that the noise will be greatly reduced or disappear
    74	altogether.  I know, you didn't buy a 2,400 BPS modem just to retard it to
    75	1,200 BPS.  The brand of the modem plays a part in the immunity to line noise.
    76	Some modems can digest more noise (lower signal-to-noise radio) than others.
    77	PC Magazine (same issue mentioned above) ran a test on 87 different modems.
    78	You might check the results to see how your modem ranks.  Most 2,400 BPS
    79	modems operating at 1,200 BPS have approximately -8 to -10 db error threshold
    80	while the same modem has about -16 to -20 db threshold operating at 2,400 BPS.
    81	For this reason, line quality is much more critical at 2,400 BPS operation.
    82	
    83	     Additionally, a friend of mine who runs a bulletin board from their
    84	office has been plagued with line noise problems at 2,400 BPS but very little
    85	noise at 1,200 BPS.  The culprit is the office's centralized telephone system.
    86	Many office buildings have a given number of trunks that actually enter the
    87	building while there may be many, many more extension within the building.
    88	These types of telephone systems have their own controllers and line
    89	assignment devices and are frequently not as high in quality as a hard-wired
    90	Mabell line.  The acceptable signal-to-noise ratio in some of these
    91	inter-office phone controllers are lower than necessary for reliable 2,400 BPS
    92	operation but not too low for 1,200 BPS.
    93	
    94	     If you gets transmission errors while downloading or uploading a file,
    95	don't fret it.  The Xmodem (or whatever protocol) incorporates an error
    96	checking/correction mechanism that automatically detects and corrects any
    97	errors that may occur during transmission.  The very fact that Xmodem reported
    98	the error in the first place means that he caught it and corrected it.  The
    99	only errors you have to worry about are the ones that Xmodem does NOT report
   100	Any reported error has already be corrected.  Xmodem, especially the CRC
   101	flavored one, is a very reliable file transfer protocol.  Even if you got 100
   102	errors during transmission, chances are still pretty slim that the file got
   103	corrupted.  Occasionally, a file will be corrupted after transfer, but many
   104	times this may be due to a bad ARCing of the file or perhaps a disk error that
   105	may have occured sometime during the files' past.
   106	
   107	    I hope this text helped explain some facts about modems, line noise, and
   108	file transfers.  If you have other, more specific questions, concerning modems
   109	or communications in general, leave a C)omment to the SYSOP on the PC
   110	Consultant.  I'll try to answer them.
