    29	 filed by SEA's Thom Henderson (author of ARC) against PKware's

    57	            Plaintiff, System Enhancement Associates, Inc.
    58	 ("SEA"), as and for a complaint alleges as follows:
    59	
    60	               THE PARTIES - JURISDICTION AND VENUE
    61	
    62	           1.  Plaintiff SYSTEM ENHANCEMENT ASSOCIATES, INC.
    63	 hereinafter Plaintiff or SEA, is a corporation of the State
    64	 of New Jersey having a place of business at 21 New Street,
    65	 Wayne, NJ 07470.  Plaintiff is engaged in the business of
    66	 developing and licensing others to use computer programs and
    67	 software.
    68	
    69	           2.  Defendant PKWARE, INC. is a corporation of
    70	 the State of Wisconsin.  Upon information and belief, Defen-
    71	 dants are engaged in the business of licensing others to use
    72	 computer programs and software, and do business in the State
    73	 of Wisconsin and in this District.  Defendants maintain a
    74	 place of business at 7032 Ardara Avenue, Glendale, WI 53209.
    75	
    76	           3.  Defendant Phillip W. Katz ("Katz"), AKA Phil
    77	 Katz, is an officer and a director of Defendant PKWARE.
    78	 Defendant Katz resides in the State of Wisconsin and in this
    79	 District.  All acts by Defendant PKWARE complained of herein
    80	 were made with full knowledge and under the specific direction
    81	 and control of Defendant Katz.
    82	
    83	           4.  This COMPLAINT sets forth causes of action for
    84	 copyright infringement under 17 USC 101, et seq and trade-
    85	 mark infringement and unfair competition under the Lanham
    86	 Act, 15 USC 1051, et seq and under common law.
    87	
    88	           5.  This Court has original jurisdiction over the
    89	 Copyright and Lanham Act claims pursuant to 28 USC 1338(a)
    90	 and, with respect to the Lanham Act claims, additionally
    91	 under 15 USC 1121, and over the other claims under the
    92	 doctrine of pendant jurisdiction.  This Court further has
    93	 jurisdiction over the other claims pursuant to both 28 USC
    94	 1338(b), and because this civil action is between citizens
    95	 of different States and the matter in controversy exceeds
    96	 the sum or value of $10,000, 28 USC 1332(a)(1).
    97	
    98	           6.  Venue is proper as to the Defendants pursuant
    99	 to 28 USC 1391 generally and as to the copyright infringement
   100	 causes of action pursuant to 28 USC 1400(a).
   101	
   102	           7.  This Court has jurisdiction over the subject
   103	 matter in controversy and the parties to this action.  Venue
   104	 is proper as to the Defendants, who reside or may be found
   105	 in this District.
   106	
   107	                 COUNT I:  COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT
   108	
   109	           8.  Prior to October 1986, Plaintiff, who was then
   110	 and ever since has been a citizen of the United States and
   111	 the State of New Jersey, created and wrote an original work,
   112	 namely a computer program, entitled "ARC File Archive Utility
   113	 Version 5.20", and additionally, prior to April 1987, created
   114	 and wrote a revised version of such work, entitled "ARC File
   115	 Archive Utility Version 5.21" (hereinafter collectively
   116	 referred to as the "ARC programs").
   117	
   118	           9.  Each of the ARC programs contains a large
   119	 amount of material wholly original with Plaintiff and is
   120	 copyrightable subject matter under the laws of the United
   121	 States.
   122	
   123	           10.  At all times relevant to this action, Plaintiff
   124	 complied in all respects with the Copyright Act of 1976 and
   125	 all other laws governing Copyright, and secured the exclusive
   126	 rights and privileges in and to the Copyrights to the ARC
   127	 programs.
   128	
   129	           11.  Plaintiff has received from the Register of
   130	 Copyrights Certificates of Registration, dated and identified
   131	 as follows:
   132	
   133	           a.  February 16, 1988, TX2-242-311; and
   134	           b.  March 30, 1988, TX2-264-701
   135	
   136	 for, respectively, "ARC File Archive Utility Version 5.20"
   137	 and "ARC File Archive Utility Version 5.21".
   138	
   139	           12.  At all times relevant to this action, Plaintiff
   140	 has been and is the sole proprietor of all rights, title and
   141	 interest in and to the Copyrights in the ARC programs.
   142	
   143	           13.  Each copy of the copyrighted ARC programs
   144	 published by Plaintiff and all copies made by Plaintiff or
   145	 under its authority had associated therewith a restrictive
   146	 license prohibiting copying any ARC programs for purposes of
   147	 commercial exploitation.
   148	
   149	           14.  After October 1986 and April 1987, Defendants,
   150	 jointly and severally, infringed Plaintiff's Copyrights by
   151	 publishing, placing on the market and commercially exploiting
   152	 works entitled "PKARC FAST! Archive Create/Update Utility
   153	 Version 3.5  04-27-87" and "PKXARC FAST! Archive Extract
   154	 Utility Version 3.5  04-27-87" (the "infringing works") which
   155	 were copied largely from Plaintiff's copyrighted works "ARC
   156	 File Utility Version 5.20" and "ARC File Utility Version
   157	 5.21".
   158	
   159	           15.  Continuously since about at least as early as
   160	 April 27, 1987, Defendants have, to Plaintiff's irreparable
   161	 damage, been publishing, licensing and selling, and otherwise
   162	 making commercial exploitation of the infringing works,
   163	 utilizing the same channels of commerce as Plaintiff, adver-
   164	 tising in the same journals (one example of which is hereto
   165	 attached as Plaintiff's Exhibit 10) and marketing such
   166	 infringing works in the same manner as Plaintiff.
   167	
   168	           16.  Defendants' infringing works were published
   169	 and commercially exploited without license or authorization
   170	 by Plaintiff.
   171	
   172	           17.  True copies of Plaintiff's copyrighted works,
   173	 and the respective Registrations therefor, are hereto attached
   174	 as Plaintiff's Exhibits 1 through 4, respectively.
   175	
   176	           18.  Copies of documentation for Defendants'
   177	 infringing works are hereto attached as Plaintiff's Exhibits
   178	 5 and 6, respectively.  On information and belief, Plaintiff's
   179	 Exhibits 5 and 6 are true copies of works of Defendants
   180	 published under the authority or license of Defendants,
   181	 jointly and severally, for which Defendants bear responsi-
   182	 bility.
   183	
   184	           19.  Plaintiff, by its Attorney, notified Defendants
   185	 that Defendants have infringed and are infringing Plaintiff's
   186	 copyrights by a US Postal Service Certified Mail letter dated
   187	 December 23, 1987.  True copies of said notice letter and
   188	 its Return Receipt are hereto attached as Plaintiff's Exhibits
   189	 7 and 8, respectively.
   190	
   191	           20.  Defendants, by their Attorneys, responded by
   192	 letter, dated January 8, 1988, to Plaintiff's Attorney denying
   193	 infringement.  A true copy of Defendants' Attorneys' letter
   194	 is attached hereto as Plaintiff's Exhibit 9.
   195	
   196	           21.  At all times here relevant Defendants were
   197	 aware of Plaintiff's copyrights in the ARC programs.
   198	
   199	           22.  Notwithstanding knowledge of Plaintiff's
   200	 copyrights and specific notice of infringement, Defendants
   201	 have continued to infringe Plaintiff's copyrights.
   202	
   203	           23.  Defendants did willfully and deliberately
   204	 copy Plaintiff's ARC programs and infringe Plaintiff's copy-
   205	 rights.
   206	
   207	             COUNT II:  VIOLATIONS OF THE LANHAM ACT
   208	
   209	           24.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the averments
   210	 and allegations contained in numbered paragraphs hereinabove
   211	 as though fully set forth here.
   212	
   213	           25.  Plaintiff has extensively used and promoted
   214	 intrastate and interstate commerce the trademark "ARC" in
   215	 connection with computer programs and software.  Exemplary
   216	 uses of Plaintiff's ARC trademark is shown in Exhibits 1 and
   217	 3.  Plaintiff has continuously used its ARC trademark on its
   218	 goods shipped throughout the United States and the world.
   219	 The ARC trademark has come to be recognized as identifying
   220	 Plaintiff as the source of its products and symbolizes
   221	 valuable goodwill belonging to Plaintiff.  Such recognition
   222	 and goodwill arose and accrued prior to the acts complained
   223	 of herein.
   224	
   225	           26.  Due the very high level of originality and
   226	 quality of Plaintiff's File Archive Utility programs, and
   227	 their distribution methods and marketing, Plaintiff and its
   228	 ARC programs have become recognized as the "standard" in
   229	 the personal computer industry.  An example of such recognition
   230	 is hereto attached as Plaintiff's Exhibit 11.
   231	
   232	           27.  Plaintiff has expended significant time and
   233	 money in promoting and advertising its File Archive Utility
   234	 ARC programs, and the trademark ARC has become associated
   235	 with Plaintiff as denoting the source or origin of high
   236	 quality File Archive Utility programs.  In the personal
   237	 computer market and to the users of such computers, the mark
   238	 ARC denotes Plaintiff as the source or origin of such
   239	 programs.  In this regard, an article from Dr. Dobbs Journal,
   240	 March 1987, pp 26-28, 30 is hereto attached as Plaintiff's
   241	 Exhibit 12.
   242	
   243	           28.  Defendants do not have, nor have ever had, any
   244	 right or authorization to use Plaintiff's ARC trademark.
   245	
   246	           29.  Defendants have prominently used and are using
   247	 marks confusingly similar to Plaintiff's ARC trademark, to
   248	 wit, PKARC and PKXARC.  The infringing marks are shown as
   249	 used by Defendant in Plaintiff's Exhibits 5, 6 and 13.
   250	
   251	           30.  Defendants have used and continue to use the
   252	 marks PKARC and PKXARC in connection with goods functionally
   253	 identical to Plaintiff's, in commerce and in the same channels
   254	 of trade as Plaintiff's ARC programs.  Defendants use such
   255	 marks on, and in connection with publishing, distributing,
   256	 advertising and marketing throughout the United States, and
   257	 in this district, File Archive Utility programs.
   258	
   259	           31.  Defendants unauthorized use of PKARC and
   260	 PKXARC is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake
   261	 or to deceive prospective acquirers of such goods into
   262	 believing that the products of Defendants originated with or
   263	 under the sponsorship or license of Plaintiff.
   264	
   265	           32.  Defendants, by improper use of Plaintiff's
   266	 trademark ARC, have falsely described or represented the
   267	 Defendants' PKARC and PKXARC programs as the goods of
   268	 Plaintiff and have, by causing such products to enter into
   269	 commerce, created a tendency for such false description or
   270	 representation to be understood as having an origin or
   271	 sponsorship or license of Plaintiff, thereby diverting income
   272	 from Plaintiff to Defendants.  Plaintiff has been, is being
   273	 and is likely to be damaged by the use by Defendants of the
   274	 aforesaid false description or representation.
   275	
   276	           33.  Defendant acts are in violation of Section
   277	 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 USC 1125(a).
   278	
   279	           34.  At all times relevant hereto, Defendants were
   280	 aware of Plaintiff's use of the ARC trademark.
   281	
   282	           35.  Upon information and belief, Defendants adopted
   283	 the PKARC and PKXARC marks to portray to potential consumers
   284	 a relationship between Defendant's products and Plaintiff's
   285	 products.
   286	
   287	           36.  Upon information and belief, all Defendant's
   288	 acts complained of herein were done with the intent to cause
   289	 confusion among customers as to an affiliation between
   290	 Defendants and Plaintiff and to capitalize improperly on the
   291	 goodwill accruing to Plaintiff.
   292	
   293	      COUNT III:  TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT; UNFAIR COMPETITION
   294	
   295	           37.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the averments
   296	 and allegations contained in the numbered paragraphs herein
   297	 above as though fully set forth here.
   298	
   299	           38.  Defendants are, by the acts complained of
   300	 herein, infringing on Plaintiff's trademark rights, and
   301	 engaging in unfair trade practices and unfair competition,
   302	 all in violation of the common law of the State of Wisconsin.
   303	
   304	     COUNT IV:  COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT AND UNFAIR COMPETITION
   305	
   306	           39.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the averments
   307	 and allegations contained in numbered paragraphs hereinabove
   308	 as though fully set forth here.
   309	
   310	           40.  Defendants have, in addition to the acts as
   311	 alleged above, substantially copied and plagiarized the entire
   312	 appearance and user interface and screens which result when
   313	 a computer user interacts with or uses Plaintiff's ARC
   314	 programs and the manner in which the Plaintiff's ARC programs
   315	 interface with and interact with the computer user, with the
   316	 specific intent to create a belief with the consumer of a
   317	 relationship between Defendants' products and Plaintiff's
   318	 products.  (A copy of Defendants' advertising, PKWARE, INC.
   319	 advertisement, PC TECH JOURNAL, October 1987, p 220, is
   320	 hereto attached as Plaintiff's Exhibit 14.)
   321	
   322	           41.  Defendants' acts as heretofore alleged
   323	 constitute infringement of Plaintiff's Copyrights and unfair
   324	 trade practices and unfair competition to the irreparable
   325	 damage of Plaintiff.
   326	
   327	           42.  Defendants' acts, as alleged herein and above,
   328	 have been willful and deliberate intending to harm and damage
   329	 Plaintiff and its business.
   330	
   331	         WHEREFORE PLAINTIFF DEMANDS JUDGMENT AS FOLLOWS:
   332	
   333	           (1)  Enjoining Defendants, jointly and severally,
   334	 and any of their agents, servants or any in active concert
   335	 or participation with any of them, temporarily during the

   337	 infringing Plaintiff's copyrights in any manner, and from
   338	 publishing, licensing, selling, distributing or marketing or
   339	 otherwise disposing of any copies of Defendants' works PKARC
   340	 and PKXARC; and from infringing in any manner Plaintiff's
   341	 trademark ARC;

   343	           (2)  Ordering the Defendants, jointly and severally,

   347	 unfair competition and to account for:
   348	
   349	              (a)  all gains, profits and advantages derived
   350	    by Defendants and each of them by said trade practices

   355	    Plaintiff's copyrights or such damages as to the Court
   356	    shall appear proper within the provisions of the Copyright
   357	    Act of 1976, but not less than the statutory minimums
   358	    therein provided; and
   359	
   360	              (c)  all gains, profits and advantages derived
   361	    by Defendants and each of them by infringement of
   362	    Plaintiff's trademark or such damages as to the Court
   363	    shall appear proper within the provisions of the Lanham
   364	    Act;
   365	
   366	           (3) Trebling Plaintiff's damages and awarding any
   367	 statutory damages at the highest level allowed;

   468	 Article 13518 of comp.sys.ibm.pc:
   469	 From: tneff@dasys1.UUCP (Tom Neff)
   470	 Subject: This damn Katz/SEA/ARC thing
   471	 Summary: use Vernware instead
   472	 Date: 5 Jul 88 19:46:27 GMT
   473	
   474	The following is my own personal opinion, long and strongly held, pure and
   475	simple.  Take it for what it's worth.
   476	
   477	I don't know exactly why SEA sued Phil Katz and I don't care.  PKARC has never
   478	had a place on my software shelf and it never will.  I keep four files handy:
   479	ARC.EXE, ARCE.COM, ARCA.COM and ARCV.COM.  ARC.EXE, by SEAware, is the
   480	standard.  I don't use it normally but I keep it around for verification in
   481	case there's a problem with a particular archive's format or contents.  If
   482	ARC.EXE won't read it, it doesn't get posted anywhere I control.
   483	
   484	The only problem with ARC.EXE it that it's slow, thanks to the porcine
   485	Computer Innovations C86 runtime library.  For high speed performance, I turn
   486	to three superb, tiny support utilities from Vern Buerg and Wayne Chin.  ARCV
   487	displays archive directories, ARCE extracts files (to disk or stdout) and ARCA
   488	builds new archives from component files (with optional delete afterwards). 
   489	They are all small enough to put in a command cache RAMdisk if you want; they
   490	run ultrafast, reliably, and they never waste your time begging for money or
   491	trumpeting their virtues in big banners.  ARCE, in particular, is ideal for
   492	handing out to people with ARC files you distribute -- it's small, the syntax
   493	is self evident, and it does just what you want.  Plus there's no embarrassing
   494	panhandling for someone else's bank account to spoil the moment. :-)
   495	
   496	Basically I have never felt that the archiver niche (it doesn't deserve to be
   497	called a "market") has needed a shareware clone.  The grapevine word for years
   498	was that Katz asked to see some ASM source in a "friendly" way, then dropped
   499	out of sight and emerged in a couple of months with a beg-ware lookalike. 
   500	PKARC has been so assiduously hyped over the past two years that the average
   501	user these days has never heard of ARC.EXE itself, let alone the optimized
   502	Buerg/Chin companion programs.  It's a damn shame.  Of course, the whole
   503	"squash" incompatibility fiasco was just icing on this particular cake.  I
   504	haven't got a clue as to whether there is any merit to SEA's case per se, but
   505	nothing can make Katz a hero.  Use the freeware programs and pass them on. 
   506	That's my advice.
   507	
   508	PS Vern's ARCE reads squashed archives OK as of version 3.1b, released last
   509	year.  If anyone would like a copy let me know, although I suspect I'll be
   510	posting it to c.b.i.pc soon anyway.

   537	SEA vs PKWare -- What's It About?  by Ben Baker -- 44/76
   538	
   539	I suppose most of you know by now know that System Enhancement Associates
   540	(SEA) is suing Phil Katz and PKWare.  There has bee a lot of comment (I
   541	hesitate to call it discussion) on the suit in conferences in FidoNet and the
   542	commercial services.  Most of what I have read gave me the impression that the
   543	writer thought about it for at least 30 milliseconds, then flamed!  So what's
   544	it really about? 
   545	
   546	First, a little history.  In CP/M days, there were a number of utilities for
   547	compressing and decompressing files, based on the Huffman coding technique. 
   548	The most popular were called SQ and USQ, but there were several variations. 
   549	There was at least one utility called LIB, which did not do compression
   550	(remember the total memory space was only 64K, and CP/M used at least 4K of
   551	that), but it did collect files, "squeezed" or otherwise, into a single file
   552	so that they could be treated as a unit. 
   553	
   554	When MS-DOS came along, many of the old CP/M utilities were ported.  Among
   555	them were several (often incompatible) variations of SQ/USQ.  Our own Tom
   556	Jennings ported LIB to DOS.  DOS BBS operators then had all the functionality
   557	they had in CP/M; they could compress files, and they could pack them into
   558	"library" files, in separate steps of course.  But DOS wasn't memory poor like
   559	CP/M.  The climate was right for something "new." Enter Thom Henderson. 
   560	
   561	Henderson, one of SEA's principals, borrowing from concepts developed by Brian
   562	Kernigan, wrote a "library" utility which overcame a limitation of LIB by
   563	using a distributed directory instead of a fixed-length directory at the front
   564	of the file.  It also had built-in Huffman code compression, eliminating the
   565	need for SQ/USQ.  He called it ARC.  Almost overnight, it became a standard
   566	among bulletin board operators. 
   567	
   568	As ARC developed, it acquired a number of useful features, encryption and LZ
   569	compression, for example, stirring interest in the commercial marketplace. 
   570	Thus ARC became one of those products marketed both commercially and as
   571	shareware. 
   572	
   573	In an effort to encourage porting ARC to other systems such as Unix, SEA made
   574	the sources for ARC available for download on its bulletin board.  These files
   575	bear the SEA copyright notice, and before people may legally do anything with
   576	them other than study them, they need SEA's permission. When someone asks
   577	permission to port, it is granted with three restrictions on the resulting
   578	program: it may not be sold, it may not be used commercially and a copy must
   579	be submitted to SEA for redistribution (under the same restrictions).  Someone
   580	may also use the sources in a commercial product, but in this case, a source
   581	license fee is charged and the resulting program may NOT be a general purpose
   582	file-archiving utility. 
   583	
   584	FidoNews 5-27 Page 14 4 Jul 1988
   585	
   586	A short time later PKXARC appeared on the scene, followed quickly by PKARC. 
   587	Katz hadn't followed the rules, but then, ARC wasn't making anybody rich as
   588	shareware, and Katz wasn't addressing the much more lucrative commercial
   589	market SEA had developed for ARC, so SEA overlooked it.  Then, last year, an
   590	ad for PKARC and PKXARC appeared in "PC Tech Journal" on the page facing SEA's
   591	ad for ARC.  Katz' ad priced the product a dollar and a half less than ARC,
   592	and even went so far as to make comparisons to "the other archive utility."
   593	
   594	SEA then sent a "cease and desist" letter to PKWare, proposing the following
   595	agreement: PKWare would withdraw all commercial advertising and cease attempts
   596	at commercial distribution, and SEA would forgive past violations and grant
   597	PKWare an unlimited cost-free license to market its derivative products as
   598	shareware with a non-commercial restriction.  Katz refused. 
   599	
   600	I suspect, though I don't know, that there were additional exchanges between
   601	SEA and PKWare.  Were it me, I would have demanded a source license fee and
   602	royalties on sales to date.  In any event, no agreement was reached, so SEA
   603	filed suit. 
   604	
   605	As I understand it, there are four counts in the complaint (not necessarily in
   606	this order): 1) "look-and-feel" violation, 2) copyright violation, 3)
   607	trademark violation, and 4) unfair trade practice.  Let's look at them one at
   608	a time. 
   609	
   610	I placed "look-and-feel" first because it's fairly easy to dismiss.  I
   611	personally don't think SEA has a prayer on this one.  "Look-and-feel" is  the
   612	current  legal buzz-word  so SEA's lawyer tossed it in, but I can't imagine it
   613	applying in this case. 
   614	
   615	A concept or idea cannot be copyrighted, but the expression of a concept or
   616	idea sure can, and a program is the expression of one or more concepts or
   617	ideas.  If the development of PKXARC and PKARC were entirely independent of
   618	ARC, merely employing the concepts used there, then the second count cannot be
   619	sustained.  If it can be shown that Katz obtained or had access to the sources
   620	for ARC, then he probably infringed on SEA's copyright.  If it can be shown
   621	that he actually used them in developing his programs, then he IS guilty of
   622	copyright infringement.  Even if he translated them to assembly language, he
   623	violated the copyright.  Translating a novel from English to German without
   624	the permission of the author and/or publisher is prohibited by copyright laws
   625	world-wide.  Same principle. 
   626	
   627	Is ARC a trademark?  As relating to archiving or compression utilities, you
   628	bet.  Does the name "PKARC" violate that trademark?  Suppose I developed a new
   629	soft drink and began marketing it under the name "BBCOKE." How quickly would I
   630	find myself in court?  And isn't there a network developer using the name
   631	"ARC," and are they in jeopardy?  No!  If I were a fuel dealer, I could sell
   632	all the "Coke" (a coal derivative) I wanted and the Coca Cola Co.  couldn't
   633	care less.  This one will be tough for Katz to beat. 
   634	
   635	FidoNews 5-27 Page 15 4 Jul 1988
   636	
   637	Why is a trademark important, anyway?  A company spends considerable effort,
   638	not to mention money, establishing a trademark.  I mentioned Coke in the
   639	previous paragraph.  Did anyone have any doubt what company I was referring
   640	to?  This is called "product recognition" and it is an extremely valuable
   641	asset.  SEA has it with "ARC," but that didn't just happen.  They worked at
   642	it.  My "BBCOKE" would be trading on product recognition it didn't earn on its
   643	own.  If I then sought out advertisements for Coca Cola, and placed ads of my
   644	own, claiming (whether right or not) "BBCOKE is better than the other cola"
   645	next to all I could find, would I be engaging in fair trade?  Do you think I
   646	could argue that I was not trying to deliberately undermine the effect of
   647	their advertising and take advantage of their recognition?  Do you suppose
   648	that Coca Cola would give me the courtesy of a letter before they fell on me
   649	like a ton of bricks?  If any of the first three counts can be sustained, then
   650	the fourth probably should be also. 
   651	
   652	A recent "PC Week" article has caused considerable comment on this issue.  One
   653	mentioned a "fact" cited in the article that PKWare was a four-employee
   654	company operating out of Katz' home, and implied this was a Goliath attacking
   655	a David.  The "facts" may or may not be true.  The article was so badly
   656	written and so poorly researched as to call into question all of its "facts."
   657	The fact is that SEA is a four-employee (counting the principals) company. 
   658	The Wayne (not Fort Wayne) NJ corporate address is Andy Foray's home.  These
   659	are TWO small companies.  Neither has the resources to pursue a protracted
   660	legal battle.  I think we can expect a reasonably quick resolution. 
   661	
   662	So how does it all affect you?  Will you still be allowed to use a Unix port
   663	of ARC?  Of course.  Most ports have been made with permission, and even those
   664	which have not are not encroaching on SEA's commercial market.  Will you still
   665	be able to use PKARC or PKXARC copies you obtained through shareware?  You did
   666	so in good faith and SEA has neither the resources nor the inclination to
   667	search you out and persecute you.  In fact, should Katz lose the suit, he
   668	might still be granted a license to market his programs as shareware.  For
   669	that, we'll have to await the final resolution.  SEA is NOT being vindictive. 
   670	They are trying to protect what they regard as a valuable commercial asset. 
   671	
   672	If you are a shareware software developer, as I am, it may affect you in a
   673	different way.  The lawyers have been telling us for several years that the
   674	copyright laws do in fact protect products marketed as "shareware." But so
   675	far, no court has said so, and the courts of the land are the final arbiters
   676	of the law.  A win for SEA, particularly on the second count above, would
   677	place all, big or small, on notice!  Shareware is NOT public domain!  A win
   678	for Katz, on the other hand, is a signal to shareware authors, and a source of
   679	inexpensive, quality software might well dry up.  If that happened, it would
   680	hurt developers and users alike.  Think about it. 
   681	
   682	================ end quote ================
   683	
   684	I take issue with one conclusion of the author...  if there is any validity to
   685	any look and feel suit, this is it.  While the zoo and dwc archivers have
   686	different help and directory screens, PKARC seems to have copied those screens
   687	directly from ARC. 
   688	
   689	I wonder when one of these programs will switch to 16 bit compression and just
   690	say "if you want to run this get 512k on your box." There are a lot of
   691	programs which need it now, and staying with the restrictions of the original
   692	256k PC is pretty pointless.

   700	Tom Neff lives!  I don't know who is harder to get ahold of, him or Rahul. 
   701	They both dropped out of sight at the same time and both have resisted any of
   702	my efforts to contact them.  You don't suppose do you...?  No, couldn't be. 
   703	Still, has anyone seen Tom and Rahul in the same room?  I think they might be
   704	the same person.
   705	
   706	As to SEA and PKWARE, I say let them both rot in a pit -- a fate they fully
   707	deserve.  PKWARE for various activities already outlined.  SEA for not
   708	upgrading a piece of software to keep up with the times.  Its glacial slowness
   709	stopped being excusable a couple of years ago.  SEA has effectively abandoned
   710	their users (an argument that has been advanced by some as a possible legal
   711	point in favor of PK).  Further, Mr Henderson has proved to be unmatchable in
   712	his rudeness towards people trying to port ARC to OS/2.  Now, he brings
   713	another stupid look-and-feel lawsuit into the computer arena, as if we didn't
   714	have way too many already.
   715	
   716	No sympathy here for either.  I am quickly moving towards being a ZOO convert,
   717	but unfortunately realities are realities and I must continue uploading and
   718	downloading .ARC files if I want to access very many files, or want my files
   719	to be accessed very much.  Too bad.  Let's hope we can look forward to a
   720	future of ZOO soon.

   734	Mike, you have no idea what you are talking about, as you obviously do not

   739	see added to ARC, I suggest you write a letter and tell him so. I can
   740	guarantee that you will receive an answer.
   741	
   742	I'm going to speak about most of the points here.
   743	
   744	1) ARC being slow - ARC is slow because the techniques ARC uses to access
   745	files are GUARANTEED to be compatible with 99% of MS- and PC-DOS machines.
   746	Last I heard, ARC is developed entirely on a PC/XT machine, not due to
   747	masochism, but to ensure that it is as compatible as possible across the
   748	board. Thom and Andy are probably doing compiles and editing on a 386 machine
   749	now, but I KNOW that ARC is still tested on XT machines as the final go-ahead
   750	test.
   751	
   752	2) The suit - If Thom decided to file suite against PKWARE, it's because he
   753	has exhausted every other means of trying to protect what he feels are his
   754	rights. Thom happens to be a very modest and private person. He does not like
   755	to be in the limelight, though he enjoys interacting with people through
   756	electronic means, and he is a VERY good moderator and general organizer. A lot
   757	of what FidoNet is and isn't today is a result of a lot of hard work from
   758	Thom's part. If he finally decided to file suit, it's because he got tired of
   759	trying to reason with Phil. I'm not surprised. Squash mode is, in my opinion,
   760	a good example of what kind of person Mr. Katz must be.
   761	
   762	3) Source code - I feel Thom did not do the right thing by releasing the
   763	source to ARC to the general public. It was a virtual invitation for something
   764	like this to happen. However, the source is well- marked as a copyrighted
   765	work, and anyone that tells me that PKARC did not come from ARC's source has
   766	no idea what they are talking about. I agree with Ben Baker (whom I also know
   767	personally) that the look-and-feel issue is a moot one, it's just a catchy
   768	phrase that computer law lawyers like to use know. ARC's user interface is so
   769	generically text oriented that I don't think there's much there that Thom can
   770	claim rights to. However, everything else in the suit make a heck of a lot of
   771	sense to me.
   772	
   773	4) Clones of ARC - One of the reasons that I suspect Thom had in mind when he
   774	released the source to ARC is to deal with the many people who were asking SEA
   775	to port ARC to other machines. Rather than expend a ton of work for machines
   776	Thom and Andy had no experience with, they released the source and gave people
   777	opportunities to make "clones" of the standard for other machines under VERY
   778	explicit and clear-cut conditions. I think this is an excellent example of the
   779	kind of person Thom is.
   780	
   781	5) ARC performance revisited - ARC gives users a very easy way to speed up the
   782	program tenfold or more. You set an environment variable, ARCTEMP I believe,
   783	to whatever disk drive you want ARC to use for temp files it creates. You can
   784	also specify a path. Simple, set ARCTMP to a ram disk, and it easily matches
   785	PKARC in performance. This is in the documentation, I find it hard to believe
   786	that not many people are aware of this.
   787	
   788	6) As it relates to ZOO - I think ZOO is an excellent program and a viable
   789	alternative to ARC. Many BBS' and other systems use ZOO exclusively. When I
   790	first saw Zoo, I converted all 1000+ files on my old BBS in California to ZOO.
   791	Unfortunately, I lost all my files to a magnetic scan machine at an airport,
   792	and eventually converted back to ARC. I don't think this suit has anything to
   793	do with Zoo.
   794	
   795	7) Impact on Shareware - I hope Thom wins his suit. Any shareware developers
   796	reading this cannot help but think how good it will be for all of us to
   797	finally get some recognition from the courts for our work. Our software might
   798	actually get some badly-needed legal recognition and protection.
   799	
   800	I welcome any comments and rebuttals.

   817	Juan, I have *every* idea about what I am talking about.  I know people who
   818	know and have dealt with Mr. Henderson.  I also like to point out that I don't
   819	have to agree with you to know what I'm talking about.  (Yeah, I'm mad, but
   820	I'll get over it).
   821	
   822	Thom HAS absolutely 100% been quoted as saying extremely rude things to one
   823	person who was interested in a port of ARC to OS/2.  Several other foolish
   824	remarks were made at the time too.
   825	
   826	I can't believe that you think ARC has been supported in the slightest.  ALL
   827	of his idiotic so-called "upgrades" were minor for the past many months.  The
   828	man obviously has *NO* idea of how to make a program competitive.  The world
   829	has been crying for a better version of ARC for a long time.  PK did it. 
   830	Build a better mousetrap....
   831	
   832	Market tells all.  PKARC is already replacing ARC in most BBS's as the
   833	preferred way to go.  You can rail all you want about ARC really being pretty
   834	fast if you do this, that, or the other thing and it being well-supported. 
   835	Fact is, the people have chosen:  for greatly superior performance.  Just ask
   836	about anyone who use PKARC why.
   837	
   838	Surprise, ZOO is 100% compatible with MS-DOS generic machines too.  And guess
   839	what?  It's about 5x faster too.  Thom certainly can't hide behind
   840	compatibility as some poor excuse for slowness.  ARC is slow because either 1)
   841	he used a very very poor language to write it in, or 2) he can't program very
   842	well. I'll be kind and assume #1.  That still means that Mr. Henderson has no
   843	concept of what a modern language can do and is completely out of touch with
   844	what tools a professional should be using.  Still kind of makes him
   845	incompetent in one way or another.
   846	
   847	I've heard that a lot of Fido people are quite displeased with Mr. Henderson
   848	as well.  Since that's a third-party comment, I can't really say whether it's
   849	true or not.  But the comment was publicly made by someone who generally knows
   850	what he is talking about.  Maybe someone else can give the scoop.  Yes, I know
   851	that you're a Fido person.  However, you don't represent all Fido people.
   852	
   853	I'll will in no fashion defend Phil Katz.  I think, well, I won't say what I
   854	think since it could lead to a libel suit if he ever saw my opinion.  Suffice
   855	to say that I'll *NEVER* support PK, or his wares.  Enough has been said here
   856	about the sordid history of PKARC.  I'd support Thom over Phil if it came to
   857	that, god forbid.  Maybe that'll make you fractionally happier.
   858	
   859	I think this lawsuit has everything to do with ZOO.  Hopefully enough people
   860	will be sick enough of the two parties that they'll abandon ARC all together
   861	and move towards the future. ZOO's expansion capabilities provide a future. 
   862	ARC's doesn't. One can only hope that this lawsuit will provide the impetus.
   863	
   864	I hope that both parties drag on in this lawsuit soooo long that they go
   865	bankrupt.  Serve them both right.  I can actually see some good coming from
   866	this lawsuit if that happens.
   867	
   868	If Thom wins his suit, basically what will occur is that shareware authors
   869	will be more legally protected from their own incompetence.  If Phil wins the
   870	suit, shareware authors will be more legally open to predation of their works.
   871	Lose-lose. Please, powers-that-be if you're listening, let this suit take a
   872	loooong time to resolve.

   878	 
   879	First a couple of minor historical corrections - the first library utility was
   880	written by our own Gary Novosielski for CP/M. It was called LU, not LIB. Paul
   881	Homchick first ported LU over to a 16-bit processor, running CP/M-86 (actually
   882	MP/M-86).
   883	
   884	Now, on to a strange conclusion I have seen in a couple of the previous
   885	messages - it was stated that the fact that SEA didn't "enhance" or "actively
   886	support" ARC by more frequent and more radical upgades, by supporting more
   887	efficient compression schemes, speeding up the program, etc. is somehow a
   888	justification for someone else to steal his work. No way! This argument is  
   889	absurd both legally and ethically. When one offers software for sale, where
   890	does it say one must be chained to it forever more in terms of active
   891	development? I am not saying that I necessarily favor such action, but it is

   898	 
   899	Small correction on historical note...  someone reverse enginered LU for unix
   900	and wrote a C program named lar (Library ARchive).  lar then was taken up by a
   901	variety of folks including Tom Jennings and myself and was ported to the 16-
   902	bit micro environment.  My port "LU86" was for a short time the "standard" for
   903	ms-dos computers, and was the first LU program to support time and date
   904	stamping of member files.
   905	
   906	As to the matter at hand, I'll leave commentary on this fracus to others. Just
   907	to give folks some idea of where I stand, tho: I use zoo exclusively for my
   908	personal and business archiving, and use Vern Buerg's programs when I have to
   909	use an ARC file.  When Phil Katz improved upon ARC by adopting his own SQUASH
   910	method, it would have been far preferable if he had adopted his own PKA or PKX
   911	format instead of riding on the coattails of SEA ARC, and appropriating their
   912	market and format.
   913	
   914	This all revolves around the concept of an ARC, and whether or not it is a
   915	unique, copyrightable entitiy.  There were no ARC files before Thom Henderson
   916	wrote ARC.EXE, he clearly invented same.  He copyrighted his work, and set
   917	about trying to make money from it.  Then Phil Katz wrote a program that did
   918	the same thing and started competing in the same markets with SEA/Henderson. 
   919	Not only did he appropriate "ARC", he made his program slightly different with
   920	SQUASHING, so that SEA's program no longer worked on the formate SEA had
   921	invented, copyrighted, and marketed.  To me, this is 1) theft of intellectual
   922	property, and 2) unfair competetition to boot.
   923	
   924	Oops!  I guess I got carried away and let you know how I feel about this. 
   925	Phil Katz is a great programmer, and PKware is good stuff.  If PKARC hadn't
   926	gone around masquerading as ARC when it wasn't, and had been presented as a
   927	new, improved, alternative, then I might be using it and there would be no
   928	suit.  But that is not what happened.  Moral: make certain that the coattails
   929	you ride on do not require a fare!

   935	Careful with that "justification for someone else to steal his work." phrase
   936	Charlie.  I think the way PK did it was slimy, but fact is, algorithms can
   937	*NOT* be copyrighted.  IMPLEMENTATIONS of algorithms can.
   938	
   939	Further, the compression techniques Thom uses are generally considered public
   940	domain.  Several programs legally use one or more types.  There may be a
   941	technique he came up on his own, I dunno.  Certainly he didn't come up with
   942	all of them.  The LZW compression algorithm is one example.
   943	
   944	You may or may not be able to say that Mr. Katz stole Mr. Henderson's
   945	implementation of the algorithms used.  You can not say that Mr. Katz stole

   954	There is a legal distinction here between patent and copyright, which I am not

   957	commercially.  A competitor appropriated that format and name and also began
   958	commercial sales which hurt the inventor and "owner" of ARC.  That is either
   959	right or wrong.  Take your pick.

   965	Mike, PK did NOT build a better mousetrap. He copied an old mouse trap and but
   966	a bigger spring on it. Note that there has never been any other documentation
   967	on the ARC file formats other than the source code which SEA released. This in
   968	itself may not be proof that PK copied the algorithm, but if he didn't he was
   969	very stupid to make his program so compatible with ARC, if in fact it was
   970	developed independently.
   971	
   972	The Fido issue has nothing to do with this, but I was involved with Fido for a
   973	long time while it was experiencing growing pains. The reason some people
   974	"don't like" Thom is because a lot of the ideas he had for Fido and the net
   975	were geared towards better organization and a centralized control over the
   976	net, which makes a lot of sense. Right now there are a number of independent
   977	nets, and it's a mess. I don't intend to represent all the Fido people, but I
   978	do have a very clear picture of the story behind Fido because I was part of
   979	it.
   980	
   981	Note also that at no time did SEA or Thom say that no one could make a clone
   982	of ARC. The fact is, he has every right to say such a thing. However, he chose
   983	not to. He released copyrighted code to the public to promote clones, under
   984	very specific conditions. PKWare broke the rules, period.
   985	
   986	BTW, if market tells all, how come I have heard so many people complain about
   987	PK's "new" compression formats, etc. for the last year or so? The statement
   988	that most BBS' have converted to PK is quite innacurate. Most BBS' do make PK
   989	available and do support squashed files, but in essence the vast majority of
   990	those files are still using the original ARC formats.
   991	
   992	You really think that shareware authors are basically incompetent? Do you
   993	include yourself among that group, or are you above that. How would you like
   994	to see people copy your OVL program and sell it as PKOVL, using your ideas to
   995	make money for themselves by just making it a little faster? Would you do
   996	something about that to protect your rights?
   997	
   998	ARC was developed in C, a language which you personally have said is the
   999	language of choice. ARC is slow, but it is also portable. Proof of this is
  1000	that there are Unix, CP/M, Amiga, Mac and all kinds of other weird ports of
  1001	ARC running around. No such luck for PKARC. PK has tried to do something about
  1002	this by publishing the PK squash file and archive formats, which are basically
  1003	the same as the ARC formats except for comments and the "squash" algorithm,
  1004	but it hasn't helped much. 
  1005	
  1006	I will agree with you that algorithms cannot be copyrighted, but PK has gone
  1007	much further than that, by copying the algorithms, the file formats, the
  1008	implementation and even the NAME of the program, ARC, down the file extensions
  1009	it creates its files with.
  1010	
  1011	I also agree with Paul's statement that if PK had simply come up with a faster
  1012	solution, not a faster copy of the solution, he wouldn't be in the trouble he
  1013	is now. Notice that SEA did not, and as far as I know has no intention of,
  1014	suing Rahul for his ZOO. Nobody has sued SEA for their ARC either, because it
  1015	was developed independently with new ideas and concepts, but using public
  1016	domain algorithms.

  1024	Excuse me?  Where did I say that shareware authors are basically incompetent? 
  1025	I paid hard earned cash for both Qmodem and ProComm.  I consider both of them
  1026	better than many commercial packages.  PC-Write, PC-File, Patriquin's
  1027	utilities all get high marks in my book.  Closer to home, I've only heard good
  1028	things about your own GSETUP.  I support *GOOD* shareware, and *GOOD*
  1029	shareware does exist in reasonable quantities.  Incompetent and mediocre
  1030	shareware exists in huge quantities, but that's another matter.
  1031	
  1032	Your analogy is faulty.  I didn't release source code to OVL or PROVL.  If
  1033	someone else comes up with a better version that doesn't steal executable code
  1034	from my program, there isn't a darn thing I can do about it.  If, *IF*, PK did
  1035	in fact steal source code from SEA and perform a straight translation, he's
  1036	slime and should pay a price.  However, I don't hold Thom blameless in this
  1037	affair either, as per my previous messages.
  1038	
  1039	I admit that PK stepped in it when he copied the ARC name, and most especially
  1040	the .ARC extension.  Like I said, of the two, PK is higher on my dirt list. 
  1041	He should have used a different file extension and supported the .ARC
  1042	extension (sans squashing) as well.  He'll prolly get toasted for that
  1043	particular decision, if any.
  1044	
  1045	As far as appropriating a format and name and beginning commercial sales which
  1046	hurt an inventor and owner, except for the name part, that sounds a lot like
  1047	the Lotus lawsuit against Mosaic and Paperback (?) Software.  Look at all the
  1048	dBASE III clones.  They use dBASE III's language format, and I guarantee that
  1049	the sales of some of the stand-alone dB3 compilers take away sales from A-T. 
  1050	There is also Mirror, the Xtalk clone. The list goes on.  Clone software
  1051	copies a general format and takes sales away from the original.  Some clones
  1052	add enough features that they become the new standard.  Evolution.
  1053	
  1054	Lastly, there is a distasteful argument that I have heard, which unfortunately
  1055	does have some validity to it.  PKARC has saved thousands of people thousands
  1056	of hours.  PK is even significantly faster than Vern's utilities.  A piece of
  1057	software that helps so many people isn't 100% evil.  I seen many testimonials
  1058	from PK fanatics around the circuit.  I won't use that argument, but you
  1059	should be aware that many do.  The average Joe or Jill doesn't much care about
  1060	arcane legalities (s)he doesn't understand.  Outright theft, yes, but PKARC
  1061	code has not been proven to be stolen from SEA's source code -- although one
  1062	can have some suspicions about the matter.

  1078	 
  1079	For another opinion:  Personally, I prefer PK because it is faster,  writes a
  1080	smaller archive (with "squashing") and interfaces well with many menu driven
  1081	"arc" utilities written for it.  The individuals  crying foul because of the
  1082	archive's ARC extension should take a look at possible copyright violations
  1083	each time they write a "DOC" file for their own shareware releases.  Doesn't
  1084	someone own a patent on  a file extension of DOC?  Or WK1, WKS, or WK? ??  Who
  1085	cares?
  1086	     Additionally, if the programs seem to operate alike, but the  difference
  1087	in speed is so dramatic, who is stealing from whom, if  anyone?  If the
  1088	program is SO inferior as compared to ARCE and ARCV or the original ARC, then
  1089	WHY is it so popular?  In this area, and  most others that I'm aware of,
  1090	_________PKARC________ is the standard, NOT ARC.  I think one would do well to
  1091	re-evaluate the sample taken  of archive users to see what is really being
  1092	used more.
  1093	     The programs, when viewed side by side, may perhaps appear to be 
  1094	related.  So they are!  If they were really identical, I would be able to
  1095	squash my huge DOC files with ARC and unsquash with PKXARC, right?  NO!  So
  1096	the code cannot be identical.  Alike, perhaps.  I think if you'll look to see
  1097	how some of the code is for many of the PD workalikes,  like AS_EASY_AS and
  1098	PC_WRITE, you'll see that there are many ways to  skin a cat, as it were, but
  1099	only a few BETTER or BEST ways.  Perhaps  both PK and ARC are both latched on
  1100	to the same method?
  1101	     I have no sympathy for whining, back biting little programmers who see
  1102	their business being taken away by a superior product.  These  types will run
  1103	to the courts and present fancy mumbo-jumbo legalese  documents to support
  1104	their own shortcomings without being able to  recognize that the only reason
  1105	for their distress is that they are getting their buns kicked!  I have always,
  1106	and will continue to support and use Phil Katz' products, as they have
  1107	demonstrated on MY machine  superior performance compared with older, less
  1108	efficient products that  purport to out perform them.  NUF SAID!
