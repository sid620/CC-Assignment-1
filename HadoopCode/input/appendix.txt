     2	
     3	V.21            Standard for modem communications at 300 bps. Modems made in
     4	                the US or Canada follow the Bell 103 standard. However, the
     5	                modem can be set to answer V.21 calls from overseas.
     6	V.22            Standard for modem communications at 1200 bps, compatible
     7	                with the Bell 212A standard observed in the US and Canada.
     8	V.22 bis        Standard for modem communications at 2400 bps. The standard
     9	                includes an automatic link negotiation fallback to 1200 bps
    10	                and compatibility with Bell 212A/V.22 modems.
    11	V.23            Standard for modem communications at 1200 bps with a 75 bps
    12	                back channel.
    13	V.24            Standards layed down by the CCITT for interfacing a digital 
    14	                device to a PTT-supplied modem. V.24 is also used as an 
    15	                interface standard for connecting a peripheral device, such 
    16	                as a visual display unit or a printer, to a computer.
    17	V.25            Standard for modem communications that specifies an answer
    18	                tone different from the Bell answer tone used in the US and 
    19	                Cananda.
    20	V.32            Standard for modem communications at 9600 bps and 4800 bps. 
    21	                V.32 modems fall back at 4800 bps when line quality is 
    22	                impaired, and fall forward again to 9600 bps when line 
    23	                quality improves.
    24	V.32 bis        Standard that extends the V.32 connection range: 4800,7200,
    25	                9600, 12K and 14.4K bps. V.32 bis modems fall back to the 
    26	                next lower speed when line quality is impaired, and fall back
    27	                further as necessary. They fall forward to the next higher
    28	                speed when line quality improves.
    29	V.34            28.800 CCITT standard
    30	V.34+           31.200 & 33.600, currently only supported by US Robotics
    31	                (V.EveryThing modems) under consideration by CCITT.
    32	V.35            See V.24.
    33	V.42            Standard for modem communications that defines a two-stage
    34	                process of detection and negotiation for LAPM error control.
    35	                V.42 also supports the MNP error control protocol.
    36	V.42 bis        An extention of V.42 that defines a specific data compression 
    37	                scheme for use with V.42 and MNP error control.
    38	X.3             It describes the functions of an X.25 PAD and the parameters 
    39	                used to control its operation.
    40	X.21            Interface between DTE and DCE for synchronous operation on 
    41	                on public data networks.
    42	X.25            Interface between DTE and DCE for terminals operating in 
    43	                packet mode on public data networks.
    44	X.28            It defines the interactions between a terminal and an X.25 
    45	                PAD.
    46	X.29            It defines the interactions between a host and its associated 
    47	                PAD.
    48	X.75            ISDN, EuroStandard, 64000.
    49	X.400           Message handling systems : System model and service elements.
    50	X.401           Message handling systems : Basic service elements and 
    51	                optional user facilities.
    52	X.408           Message handling systems : Encoded information type 
    53	                convertion rules.
    54	X.409           Message handling systems : Presentation transfer syntax and 
    55	                notation.
    56	X.410           Message handling systems : Remote operations and reliable 
    57	                transfer server.
