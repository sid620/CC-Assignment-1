     4	                       TRAVELLING WITH A LAPTOP COMPUTER
     5	
     6	       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
     7	       
     8	       Laptops are made to travel. Their small size and potent features 
     9	       make computing on the road a snap. Consider using this 
    10	       assortment of tips which seasoned laptop owners have come to 
    11	       rely on.... 
    12	
    13	       Airports are a frequent transit point for laptop owners. Be sure 
    14	       to be prepared for a SPEEDY passage through airport security by 
    15	       being aware that in most cases you MUST boot up the laptop so 
    16	       that a DOS prompt, menu or other sign of visible activity is 
    17	       displayed on the screen. Security officials do this for a 
    18	       reason: if a laptop computer has been tampered with or hollowed 
    19	       out to serve as an empty shell for explosives or weapons, the 
    20	       machine will not boot up or operate. By forcing the laptop owner 
    21	       to activate the machine, airport security is effectively 
    22	       screening for tampered machines. 
    23	
    24	       Once you know this, several important tips are quite useful. 
    25	       Always carry a BOTH a fully charged battery and AC adapter with 
    26	       the laptop. No power means no possibility of booting the machine 
    27	       and your laptop might be forced to remain behind! 
    28	
    29	       To speed the process on laptops equipped with hard drives try an 
    30	       experiment. Prepare a bootable floppy disk with DOS system files 
    31	       and a short AUTOEXEC.BAT program which boots the machine rapidly 
    32	       since DOS usually tries to boot from a floppy first and then the 
    33	       hard drive second. Now time how long it takes to boot from the 
    34	       floppy as well as the hard drive. Whichever is faster is the one 
    35	       you want to use to speed your trip through airport security. But 
    36	       ALWAYS take the bootable floppy as well. Why? If your laptop 
    37	       hard drive becomes damaged in transit - a possibility in today's 
    38	       airport environments - then you have a floppy backup which will 
    39	       also get you through airport security. 
    40	
    41	       Cursor size and blink rate on many laptops are atrocious. Third 
    42	       party software utilities are available which can alter both size 
    43	       and shape of the cursor - we will discuss these in more detail 
    44	       in the software section of the Laptop tutorial. However the 
    45	       point to be made is that you might find one ideal cursor size 
    46	       and blink rate for airplane use and a DIFFERENT cursor size and 
    47	       blink rate better at the office or in the airport. Try various 
    48	       combinations in various lighting. Several different cursor 
    49	       configurations are quite handy when travelling under varying 
    50	       lighting conditions. By the way in a pinch, The WordPerfect word 
    51	       processing package has just such a utility you might want to dig 
    52	       out if you own WordPerfect but have never used software cursor 
    53	       control utility! 
    54	
    55	       Did your portable printer malfunction and crash while you are on 
    56	       the road? Or maybe you just don't want to carry your printer at 
    57	       all. Here's an obvious idea: use your laptop and modem/faxboard 
    58	       to fax your file to the hotel front desk fax machine and pick it 
    59	       up there! If your modem lacks fax transmit capability, send the 
    60	       file via modem to CompuServe and let them re-send it to your 
    61	       hotel fax machine using their fax transmission capability. 
    62	       Worried that the fax image might fade or curl with heat or 
    63	       handling? Then xerox copy it onto standard paper which is a more 
    64	       permanent material than fax paper. 
    65	
    66	       Speaking of modems, the smallest and most "laptop useful" modems 
    67	       are available from U.S. Robotics (call 708/982-5010.) Their 
    68	       World Port modem is truly tiny, fully-featured and ruggedly 
    69	       designed for travellers. Hayes has also produced the Pocket 
    70	       Modem (call 404/449-8791.) Some of the most clever portable 
    71	       modems do not even need battery power - they draw current from 
    72	       the computer or telephone line.
    73	
    74	       Hotels and airlines always have carpeting. And carpeting is 
    75	       productive of electrical static. Shuffle across the floor in 
    76	       most travel facilities on a dry or cool day and you get a spark 
    77	       when you touch the doorknob. This same static electricity 
    78	       buildup can ruin the EPROM chip in your laptop keyboard when you 
    79	       sit down to use the laptop. Be sure to first touch a bathroom 
    80	       faucet with a coin. To eliminate static in your hotel room, 
    81	       just take off your shoes and socks! 
    82	
    83	       Carry extra charged batteries on long flights or international 
    84	       flights. Seems like a simple tip, but that battery pack you 
    85	       bought two years ago may finally decide it has a one hour life 
    86	       somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean. Rechargeable batteries cannot 
    87	       be recharged forever - after two to five years they begin to die.
    88	
    89	       Be sure you know how to turn off the speaker beep facility in 
    90	       your laptop. Crowded airplanes indicate courtesy. Third party 
    91	       software utilities exist which will provide this capability if 
    92	       you own an older laptop without this software or hardware 
    93	       feature. More about this in our software tutorial. 
    94	
    95	       Conserve power on long flights. Turn down the screen brightness 
    96	       to save power. Use the auto-resume feature if your laptop 
    97	       contains the capability. Switch to slow mode or lower the 
    98	       processing speed of your CPU chip. Your instruction book may 
    99	       mention some or all of these features. 
   100	
   101	       Some laptops have a variation of the auto resume feature that 
   102	       even allows you to change batteries right in the middle of a 
   103	       program. Check your manual. Might be a lifesaver on a plane 
   104	       trip. 
   105	
   106	       Save still more power when travelling by investigating software 
   107	       ram disks or virtual disks which, unlike a spinning hard drive 
   108	       or floppy, use far less power on long airline flights. DOS 
   109	       itself comes with a reasonable although rudimentary ram drive 
   110	       called VDISK which all laptop owners should check out. You can 
   111	       also obtain third party shareware, commercial and public domain 
   112	       ram disk software. Of course be sure to save your work to a 
   113	       floppy or hard disk before you turn the machine off since a ram 
   114	       disk operates purely in memory and MUST have power to maintain 
   115	       your data. 
   116	       
   117	       If you travel out of the country, be sure to register your 
   118	       foreign made laptop with U.S. Customs when you depart - so that 
   119	       upon return you are not forced to pay duty on a machine you 
   120	       bought in the U.S. but which customs officials will suspect was 
   121	       purchased overseas. This can be a sticky subject. Contact a 
   122	       local customs office for instructions on registering your 
   123	       machine prior to departure.
   124	              
   125	       Travellers should also consider etching your name, address, 
   126	       telephone and social security number onto the machine in several 
   127	       places. Although this may decrease the resale value of the 
   128	       laptop, it also increases chances of recovery in case of theft. 
   129	       Don't make the mistake of etching ONLY your social security 
   130	       number onto your laptop. Federal privacy laws prevent release of 
   131	       your social security records even to some law enforcement 
   132	       agencies and in that respect having only your social security 
   133	       number on valuable items is probably next to worthless as a 
   134	       security item.
   135	
   136	       Hotels are getting better about providing modular plug in 
   137	       telephone jacks for laptop users who need to hook up a modem. 
   138	       But it seems the telephone jack on the wall is always ten feet 
   139	       from the nearest table where you laptop sits. Solution? Always 
   140	       bring a modem extension cord with in-line connector. Makes 
   141	       laptop modem work a joy! Another tip: use the hotel's toll free 
   142	       800 number to call ahead and doublecheck that your room is wired 
   143	       with modular plug-in telephone jacks. Takes a moment and costs 
   144	       you nothing! Speaking of plugs, investigate the new breed of 
   145	       miniature surge supressing AC adapters if you travel to foreign 
   146	       countries whose voltage can be less reliable than that in the 
   147	       U.S. 
   148	              
   149	       You can obtain special anchor plates or straps which attach to 
   150	       the bottom or side of a laptop with permanent glue. A flexible 
   151	       steel cable and lock lets you secure your laptop to a hotel 
   152	       radiator or piece of furniture and defeats all but the most 
   153	       determined thief.
   154	              
   155	       For those who absolutely need telephone links when travelling, 
   156	       consider purchasing an acoustic modem coupler which works with 
   157	       all telephones when you cannot plug your modem into the wall. 
   158	       Acoustic couplers work by attaching directly to the mouthpiece 
   159	       and earpiece of any standard phone and transfer data directly by 
   160	       sound transmission. By the way, in overseas areas you will soon 
   161	       find that you need a maddening array of special adapters to hook 
   162	       your modem to the telephone line directly. An acoustic modem 
   163	       coupler is the only truly "universal" adapter which will connect 
   164	       to all telephones throughout the world. 
   165	
   166	       Another modem tip when using hotel telephone lines: arrange with 
   167	       the front desk or operator to ALWAYS put your call DIRECTLY 
   168	       through without intervention. Many hotel system route your call 
   169	       through a switchboard which prevents your modem from getting a 
   170	       dial tone!
   171	
   172	       Diehard laptop users who communicate with the head office via 
   173	       modem should also investigate remote computing software which we 
   174	       will discuss later. Remote computing software allows you in your 
   175	       hotel in New York to call San Francisco by modem and then 
   176	       connect directly with your desktop computer or office LAN 
   177	       network. Once connected, you can run your word processor, obtain 
   178	       files, check figures on the office spreadsheet and more. In 
   179	       essence your laptop functions as a remote keyboard for a 
   180	       computer which is thousands of miles away. Shareware, public 
   181	       domain and commercial software packages of this type are 
   182	       available. But if you do this, here is one important tip many 
   183	       travellers learn the hard way: ALWAYS leave a note for the 
   184	       maintenance person or janitor which tells them not to turn off 
   185	       what appears to be your idle office desktop computer. Oh, and 
   186	       while you are gone, turn off the desktop monitor but leave on 
   187	       the pc if you plan to compute remotely. This saves power and 
   188	       prevents screen burnout! 
   189	
   190	       Need to test if two files are slightly different as you check 
   191	       newer document files against older ones? Or maybe just backup 
   192	       all NEWER revisions of your files to a floppy or transmit them 
   193	       by modem to the head office? Use the DOS XCOPY command to track 
   194	       down differences between two files such as word processing 
   195	       documents. DOS also previously had an older File Compare command 
   196	       called FC which accomplishes the same thing. Sidekick version 2 
   197	       has a reconcile feature and Lap-Link can transfer files between 
   198	       to computers and check dates and times to make sure you are 
   199	       obtaining the newest version of a file or to ensure that both 
   200	       computers indeed have the latest file. 
   201	
   202	       By the way, here is an example of how to use the DOS XCOPY 
   203	       command to copy all files from ALL subdirectories on a laptop 
   204	       hard drive named C: onto a backup floppy in the A: drive which 
   205	       have been updated on or later than March 15, 1992. Very handy 
   206	       when you are on the road and want to copy or prepare for modem 
   207	       transmission all of your updated files for the head 
   208	       office. At the DOS prompt type: 
   209	
   210	       XCOPY C:\*.* A:/S/D:03/15/92 
   211	
   212	       Consider travel insurance for replacement of your laptop in case 
   213	       of theft. Contact Safeware at 800/848-3469.
   214	
   215	       Business travellers often have to present VERY important 
   216	       presentations with their laptops. Essential job proposals, 
   217	       contracts, crucial price schedules. If it is important to your 
   218	       business, always make a backup copy on floppy disk. Seems 
   219	       simple, but many business users discover that their hard drive 
   220	       equipped laptop has crashed due to airport handling in transit. 
   221	       A floppy can save the day and in a pinch you can rent a computer 
   222	       or borrow one from your client. If data matters, put it on a 
   223	       floppy. 
   224	
   225	       Make sure you ALWAYS carry a null modem cable and file transfer 
   226	       software with your laptop when travelling. You can probably 
   227	       patch into another desktop computer to transfer files in 
   228	       emergency, but without the null modem cable and software you are 
   229	       stuck. Practice transferring files between several computers 
   230	       before you travel so you have the process comfortably memorized.
   231	
   232	       For the truly worried traveller, also carry a pair of gender 
   233	       changer plugs which allow hookup of male to male and female to 
   234	       female cable connections. Also a 25 to 9 pin plug adapter.
   235	
   236	       Laptop computer die in transit? Carry a set of jewelers 
   237	       screwdrivers and floppy disk cleaning kit. If a few simple 
   238	       things such as this won't fix it, then grab the yellow pages and 
   239	       look under computer rentals. By the way, many hotels maintain 
   240	       rental laptops for business travellers. But the secret is that 
   241	       the rate is far cheaper by renting from a local vendor than the 
   242	       hotel. Make a few phone calls and get a laptop delivered to your 
   243	       hotel suite in case of emergency. The smartest travellers call 
   244	       ahead to their destination and reserve a backup laptop in case 
   245	       of problems at a local vendor. If the laptop is not checked out 
   246	       a small retainer fee is kept by the vendor. This can be done by 
   247	       a charge card and a long distance phone call. Same goes for 
   248	       renting LCD projection panels for business meetings. 
   249	
   250	       Consider obtaining a CompuServe account for modem use if you 
   251	       travel frequently. You can obtain online support for laptop 
   252	       computer problems directly from the manufacturer, download 
   253	       special software utility files, transmit important files to the 
   254	       home office, send faxes when all you have is a modem which lacks 
   255	       fax transmit capabilities (CompuServe converts your modem 
   256	       transmission and sends it on via their fax equipment.) Lots of 
   257	       good ideas and special laptop discussion forums for business 
   258	       travelers. You can even book hotel and airline reservations 
   259	       directly by modem using CompuServe, too. Laptops, travel and 
   260	       CompuServe go together handsomely.
   261	
   262	       Did your ribbon die in your portable printer? Just not black 
   263	       enough? Stick some fax paper in the printer. It is heat 
   264	       sensitive and will frequently pick up an image without a printer 
   265	       ribbon. Amazing but true. This works with dot matrix printers. 
   266	       Do not try it with laser printers.
   267	
   268	       Check ahead for special regulations. Example: in Germany modems 
   269	       are regulated under certain security laws - presumably spies 
   270	       could use them to transmit data. You must have a "modem permit" 
   271	       in that country or your equipment can be confiscated. In other 
   272	       countries and some developing nations such as Africa and India 
   273	       confiscation of computer equipment is common - even if all of 
   274	       your registration and travel documents are in order! In those 
   275	       cases you might be better off leaving your computer at home and 
   276	       bringing a tape recorder or notepad. Just because you own a 
   277	       computer does not mean you can use it in an unrestricted 
   278	       fashion while you travel!
   279	
   280	       Tempted to use one of those inexpensive overseas power 
   281	       convertors to adapt your AC plug in convertor to European 
   282	       current? DON'T DO IT without first checking with the 
   283	       manufacturer. Those inexpensive current convertors work fine 
   284	       when changing high voltage overseas current to lower voltage US 
   285	       current for things like shavers because they reduce the voltage. 
   286	       The problem is that most of the world uses 50 cycle AC current 
   287	       versus the normal 60 cycle AC current in the U.S. Computers CANNOT 
   288	       run from these inexpensive convertors and damage may occur. 
   289	       Find out what device the manufacturer supplies or recommends for 
   290	       travel outside of your country of residence.
