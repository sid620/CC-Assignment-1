     5	        The following notes provide a guide to help people
     6	        choose which picture viewing program to use.
     7	        All the programs listed below are available for download
     8	        from the State Of Chaos BBS, Ph (09) 410-3815.

    11	CSHOW833.ZIP    -    Cshow v8.33a     -     Latest version at 19-6-91
    12	
    13	        This is one of the best known viewing programs.
    14	        It allows viewing of the following picture types :
    15	
    16	              CompuServe GIF      Rix
    17	              CompuServe RLE      Targa
    18	              MacPaint            Deluxe Paint LBM, BBM
    19	              PC Paintbrush PCX   Windows BitMaP
    20	              PC Paint PIC        TIFF
    21	              Dr. Halo
    22	
    23	        Main Features :
    24	
    25	        Supports EMS memory for panning of 1280x1024x256 pictures
    26	        Microsoft mouse compatibility
    27	        Tag groups of files for viewing and slideshows
    28	        Supports most SVGA cards and video modes
    29	        Scripts for controlling slideshows
    30	        Images can be scaled to screen size
    31	        Print pictures on a variety of printers
    32	
    33	       *NOTE : I have seen several other copies of Cshow (up to
    34	        version 8.51) claiming to be the latest. All of these
    35	        have actually turned out to be quite old versions in spite
    36	        of the version number. Version 8.33 is the latest as of
    37	        June 91 and was received direct from the programs authors.
    38	
    39	
    40	GDS109.ZIP      -    Graphics Display System v1.09
    41	
    42	        This program is quite new, the 1st release was Feb 91
    43	        It allows viewing of the following picture types :
    44	
    45	              CompuServe GIF      Rix
    46	              MacPaint            Deluxe Paint LBM, BBM
    47	              PC Paintbrush PCX
    48	
    49	        Gds can alter brightness, contrast, colour, etc and
    50	        write the changed picture back to disk.
    51	
    52	        One especially good feature of Gds is its ability to
    53	        create visual catalogs by grouping reduced pictures
    54	        together to create a single picture file.
    55	        Hundreds of individual pictures can be combined within
    56	        a single picture.
    57	
    58	        Main features :
    59	
    60	        Supports EMS memory
    61	        Uses mouse or keyboard
    62	        Supports up to 60 rows by 132 columns
    63	        Tag groups of files for processing
    64	        Supports most SVGA cards and video modes
    65	        Slideshows
    66	        Alter colours, size, shape
    67	        Zoom and clip sections of pictures
    68	        Catalog multiple pictures into a single display file
    69	        High quality image reduction
    70	        Convert between different picture formats
    71	        Most options user configurable
    72	
    73	
    74	GRAFWK60.ZIP    -    Graphic Workshop v6.0
    75	
    76	        This version is a complete rewrite and represents a great
    77	        improvement over previous versions I have used.
    78	        It allows viewing of individual images but is really
    79	        intended for conversion and manipulation of pictures
    80	        rather than use as a straight picture viewer.
    81	        It handles many different formats and is able to
    82	        convert images between any of them.
    83	        It can also produce self displaying *.EXE files for
    84	        splash screens etc in a similar manner to GIFEXE.
    85	        It allows viewing of the following picture types :
    86	
    87	              CompuServe GIF      Ventura GEM/IMG
    88	              MacPaint            TIFF
    89	              PC Paintbrush PCX   Deluxe Paint/Amiga IFF/LBM
    90	              PC Paint Pictor PIC WordPerfect Graphics WPG
    91	              Windows 3 BMP       Encapsulated PostScript EPS
    92	              Microsoft Paint MSP Text files
    93	              Truevision Targa    24-bit files
    94	
    95	        Main features :
    96	
    97	        Supports Expanded/Extended/Virtual memory
    98	        Print images on LaserJet, PostScript and other printers
    99	        Self displaying pictures (doesn't support SVGA)
   100	        Rotate, Flip and Scale images
   101	        Produce clip art from colour images
   102	        Special effects :
   103	                Colour reduction, Grey scale, Sharpen
   104	                Soften, Smudge, Posterization
   105	        Script language
   106	        Supports many SVGA cards
   107	        Many options user configurable
   108	
   109	
   110	GIFDES40.ZIP    -    Gif Desk v4.0
   111	
   112	        This program allows viewing of individual pictures or
   113	        alternatively up to 80 Gifs on screen at one time.
   114	        The multiple Gif mode can be used to create visual catalogs
   115	        in a similar way to GDS109, however the quality of its
   116	        image reduction is not as high and it cannot display as
   117	        many images at once as GDS109.
   118	
   119	        Main features :
   120	
   121	        Supports most SVGA cards
   122	        Catalog multiple pictures into a single display file
   123	        Print pictures on Laserjet compatible printers
   124	        Allows command files for automated usage.
   125	
   126	
   127	GIFEXE.ZIP      -    Gifexe v1.0
   128	
   129	        This program is not a normal picture viewer.
   130	        It is used to convert any Gif image into a self displaying
   131	        *.EXE file that can be run from the Dos prompt.
   132	        This is useful for displaying fancy splash screens before
   133	        starting up an application program etc.
   134	
   135	        Unfortunately the self displaying image is rather slow.
   136	        The registered version supports SVGA modes.
   137	
   138	
   139	GIFFIE12.ZIP    -    Giffie v1.2
   140	
   141	        This program is fairly ordinary but does have a couple of
   142	        features the others don't - special effects & descriptions.
   143	        Giffie allows you to choose whether the pictures 'fade in',
   144	        'zip up/down' or simply replace - only works for 320x200.
   145	        It can also attach a description to each Gif file to help
   146	        you keep track of what each picture is.
   147	
   148	        Supports mouse and slideshows
   149	        Print pictures on HP Paintjet or Plotter
   150	        Supports standard Vga but SVGA support is very limited
   151	
   152	
   153	GIFWARP1.ZIP    -    Gif Warp v1.0
   154	
   155	        This program is not actually intended as a viewer.
   156	        It allows you to display a GIF file and then stretch
   157	        parts of it to create weird effects.
   158	
   159	        If you feel like putting long noses and big ears on
   160	        people then this is the program to do it.
   161	        Works with pictures up to 256 colours.
   162	        Shareware version only works in 320x200 resolution.
   163	        Registered version supports SVGA.
   164	        Uses microsoft compatible mouse.
   165	        Save warped Gifs to disk.
   166	
   167	PICEM21.ZIP     -    Picem v2.1
   168	
   169	        This program is different to the others mentioned here
   170	        in that it does not draw the pictures line by line but
   171	        rather displays the completed image all at once.
   172	        It allows viewing of the following picture types :
   173	
   174	              CompuServe GIF      PC Paintbrush PCX
   175	              PC Paint PIC
   176	
   177	        Main features :
   178	
   179	        Tag groups of files for slideshows
   180	        Alter brightness & contrast
   181	        Write changed pictures back to disk
   182	        Scale images to screen size
   183	        Supports most SVGA modes
   184	        Can utilize Bios modes specific to your video card
   185	        Convert between different picture formats
   186	
   187	
   188	VUIMG.ZIP       -    VuImage v2.92
   189	
   190	        This program displays both Gif and Tiff files.
   191	        It can also print both picture types.
   192	
   193	        Main features :
   194	
   195	        Supports various SVGA cards (external drivers needed)
   196	        Images can be scaled & zoomed
   197	        Alter brightness and contrast
   198	        Tag groups of files for slideshows
   199	        Many options can be configured via command line switches

   203	      ณ So which viewer is best? ณ
   204	      ภฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤู
   205	
   206	        The viewer you choose will depend on what hardware you have
   207	        and what features you require. The following is therefore
   208	        my opinion on what I have found suits my requirements best.
   209	
   210	        Firstly a quick list of a few areas in which some of the
   211	        above viewers are lacking or have problems.
   212	
   213	        PICEM can't handle very large pictures due to memory constraints
   214	
   215	        CSHOW can't save a changed picture although it can save settings
   216	        in a separate file that it uses when redisplaying a picture
   217	
   218	        GIFDESK quality of image reductions is fairly poor, and it
   219	        can't alter contrast or brightness
   220	
   221	        GIFFIE doesn't support very many video cards or SVGA modes
   222	
   223	
   224	        I use 3 of the above programs regularly - CSHOW, GDS & PICEM
   225	
   226	        - Cshow is good if you want a general purpose picture viewer
   227	        that supports more than just the Gif format.
   228	        It has a convenient mouse & keyboard interface that is easy
   229	        to use. It handles the largest pictures and all video modes.
   230	
   231	        - Picem is the viewer I use most. I find it convenient for
   232	        quick command line viewing of single images. I also prefer
   233	        its method of displaying the completed image rather than the
   234	        line at a time method; this makes it good for slide shows.
   235	        It also displays images automatically centred on screen.
   236	
   237	        - Gds is the program to use if you are into 'patching' Gifs.
   238	        It has an excellent mouse & keyboard interface. It supports
   239	        several picture types, both viewing and writing them.
   240	        Its editing features allow rotating & flipping images. It
   241	        can alter aspect ratios, clip sections, zoom (magnify),
   242	        change brightness, contrast, colour saturation etc.
   243	        The quality of its image reductions is excellent and the
   244	        cataloging feature is very versatile.
   245	        I should point out however that some of its features are
   246	        only available in the registered version.
   247	
   248	        I believe that the 3 programs above should cover most users
   249	        requirements. The other viewing programs, and others I have
   250	        used but not mentioned here, do not in my opinion possess any
   251	        worthwhile features not already covered by Cshow, Gds & Picem.
   252	
   253	        However I should also make special mention of Graphic Workshop.
   254	        Although I don't make much use of it myself, it is definitely
   255	        a quality program. Its image conversion facilities are very
   256	        good. The self displaying *.EXE files appear much faster than
   257	        those produced by GIFEXE.
