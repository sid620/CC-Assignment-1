     2	The developer's guide to buying a 386
     3	-------------------------------------
     4	
     5	With Presentation Manager now ready, now is the time to upgrade your
     6	development machine.  Robert Schifreen surveyed the recent PC show
     7	looking for a 386 machine with colour VGA graphics that wouldn't break
     8	the bank.
     9	
    10	-----
    11	
    12	Although there were very few major product launches at the PC Show this
    13	year, the event was an ideal opportunity for those in search of a new PC
    14	to take a look at what was on offer.  As a software developer, I was
    15	after a cheap 386 machine with a fast hard disk, that would allow me to
    16	edit and compile my code as fast as possible. I wasn't too bothered about
    17	looking to buy from a major manufacturer - I wanted a VGA system (ready
    18	for Presentation Manager) with hard disk, at least 1 MB of RAM (very
    19	expandable, too) and a price tag of around œ3000.  Surprisingly, I found
    20	quite a few machines.  Each has different points in its favour, so I'll
    21	refrain from the customary tables of figures and specifications. 
    22	Instead, I'll give the basic facts on each, plus phone numbers in case
    23	you want to find out more.
    24	
    25	
    26	Amstrad 2386
    27	------------
    28	
    29	If you need your machine to be available now, don't bother reading any
    30	more of this section.  Amstrad's 386 won't be on sale until January.  By
    31	then, the company will have a 20 MHz machine with 4 MB of RAM as
    32	standard, expandable to 16, and a custom cache controller chip with 64K
    33	of 35ns static RAM.  There will be a socket for a 387.  The Amstrad BIOS
    34	will be 32 bits wide, whereas some (like Walters's) are only 16.  The
    35	fast BIOS makes it unnecessary to copy it into cache memory, as some 386
    36	machines do.
    37	
    38	Storage comprises one 1.44 MB 3.5 inch floppy, and a 65 MB RLL hard disk
    39	with 40 ms access time.  External 5.25 inch drives will also be
    40	available.  You get Microsoft Windows/386 and MS-DOS 4.0 thrown in, and
    41	the on-board VGA adaptor (chips by Paradise) is coupled with a new
    42	Amstrad 14 inch hi-res colour monitor.  The graphics system will emulate
    43	MDA, CGA, EGA and Hercules.  The whole lot will retail for œ2999+VAT
    44	which, taking the amount of RAM into account, will make it the cheapest
    45	machine on the market.
    46	
    47	Amstrad are currently overhauling their dealer network, and only the more
    48	upmarket ones will be allowed to sell this machine.  More on 0277 230222,
    49	but it's not worth calling this side of Christmas.

    51	CAS Computers Ltd
    52	-----------------
    53	
    54	CAS provide a range of 386 machines.  Perhaps the best value comes from
    55	their 20 MHz system with 40 MB 28ms hard drive, 1MB of RAM, a 1.2MB 5.25
    56	inch floppy, keyboard and VGA card, with NEC Multisync II monitor.  This
    57	retails at œ2425, to which you add VAT, and œ50 for DOS.  More on 01 291
    58	5777.
    59	
    60	Dell System 310
    61	---------------
    62	
    63	Dell launched the 20 MHz system 310 last year.  It's now been reduced in
    64	price, following the launch of their 25 MHz system 325.  The 310 (the 325
    65	is too expensive for this sub-œ3000 list) contains 1 MB of RAM, a 102 key
    66	keyboard, two serial and one parallel ports, one floppy drive (choose
    67	which size) and monitor.  A colour VGA system with 40 MB, 28 ms hard disk
    68	is now down to œ2999 + VAT.  A mono VGA system is œ200 less.  Call Dell
    69	(free) for more information, on 0800 414535.  One reason why the systems
    70	are so cheap is that Dell operate a mail order service - there are no
    71	dealers.
    72	
    73	Elonex
    74	------
    75	
    76	Elonex have a 20 MHz 386 machine called the 386-S.  This runs at 20MHz
    77	and has 2 serial ports and one Centronics.  It comes with a 44 MB, 28 ms
    78	hard disk, 2 MB of RAM and a 1.2 MB floppy.  A VGA system with VGA
    79	monitor is œ3195 + VAT.  Add œ100 for an NEC Multisync.  More on 01 965
    80	3225.
    81	
    82	
    83	Hi-Grade
    84	--------
    85	
    86	You may not have heard of the name, but it's well worth looking at the
    87	prices before you turn away.  Hi-Grade have 2 machines.  The first is
    88	based on the Micronyx motherboard and contains a 386-20, running at 20
    89	MHz.  You get 1 MB of RAM and a 20 MB, 28 ms hard drive for œ2165.  This
    90	is a mono system, and includes one of each floppy.  Add œ335 for VGA
    91	(card and monitor) and you get œ2500.  This includes 2 serial and 2
    92	parallel ports, but not DOS.  The other machine is similar spec, but runs
    93	a 386-16, though also at 20 MHz.  This is œ2085 for the full VGA system
    94	and is based on a chips and technologies motherboard.  Hi-Grade are on 01
    95	482 4024.
    96	
    97	
    98	Samsung
    99	-------
   100	
   101	The Samsung S800 is a desktop 386 running at 20 MHz.  The VGA system is
   102	due out later this month.  Meanwhile, the EGA system with 1 MB of RAM (of
   103	which the top 384K holds a copy of the BIOS), a 1.44 MB and 1.2 MB floppy
   104	and 20 MB 65 ms hard drive retails for œ2970 + VAT.  You'd need to add a
   105	monitor to this.  For a 40 MB hard drive with 28 ms access, the price
   106	goes up to œ3475.  These are official retail prices, and you can get them
   107	much cheaper.  The best reductions I have found are from Fast Micro Ltd
   108	in London, who charge œ2348 and œ2772 respectively, plus VAT.  Fast Micro
   109	are on 01 291 6565, which makes Samsung's phone number irrelevant.
   110	
   111	
   112	Vegas
   113	-----
   114	
   115	Vegas are new to the UK.  Rather than having a catalogue of two or three
   116	machines, the company sells each component separately.  You specify all
   117	the bits you want, and they will be assembled into the system of your
   118	choice.  To build a 386 system you start with a cabinet (floor standing)
   119	containing a 16 MHz 386 motherboard and an unpopulated memory card.  This
   120	is œ1378.50.  One way of making this into a usable system is to add 2 MB
   121	of RAM (œ748.50), a Mitsubishi 1.2 MB 5.25 inch floppy (œ96.75) and
   122	Mitsubishi 720K 3.5 inch drive (œ97.50), a 30 MB Seagate RLL hard drive
   123	(œ217.75 plus œ100 for controller), Genoa Super VGA card (œ230.25), 2
   124	serial ports and a parallel port (œ34.50), keyboard (œ41.75) and mono VGA
   125	monitor (œ93.25).  This comes to œ3039.25, plus VAT.  More information
   126	from Vegas on 01 659 9166.
   127	
   128	Viglen
   129	------
   130	
   131	Viglen introduced a 386 machine at the PC show.  The V4411 has a 40 MB
   132	hard drive and runs at 8, 16 or 20 MHz with zero wait states.  There is 2
   133	MB of RAM on board, 2 serial and 2 parallel ports, a games port and
   134	mouse, a 1.2 MB floppy, DOS, Windows and BASIC.  With VGA card and
   135	monitor, the price is œ3444.25 + VAT.  Another œ402.50 ups the clock
   136	speed to 25 MHz.  Further details from Viglen on 01 843 9903.
   137	
   138	
   139	Walters
   140	-------
   141	
   142	Walters launched the cheapest 386 machine of the year at the PC show. 
   143	For œ1260 + VAT you get a 16 MHz machine with 1 MB of RAM, expandable to
   144	16.  The system has 8 slots and a 1.2 MB drive, plus parallel port and
   145	Hercules graphics monitor and card.  To this, you must add œ800 for VGA,
   146	œ30 for a serial port and œ330 for a 20 MB, 65 ms hard disk, which brings
   147	the total to a very respectable œ2420 + VAT.  More on 0494 32751.
