    18	The tips and techniques described herein are primarily for use
    19	with IBM PC's and clones and other MS-DOS computers connecting to
    20	a host BBS that uses PC Board 14.2/D and higher with ProDoor 3.1.
    21	If you are using a different kind of computer, you may be limited
    22	to using the tips and techniques for plain ASCII text.  If there
    23	are mail doors available, they, along with the applicable
    24	off-line mail reading programs, should be used as the preferred
    25	method of off-line mail reading.  If you choose not to use a mail
    26	door, then the techniques presented will allow you to read and
    27	reply to more mail in addition to reducing the on-line time spent
    28	reading mail.
    29	
    30	The purpose of this tutorial is not to teach you how to use the
    31	various programs mentioned through out the tutorial.  Rather, the
    32	purpose is to show you how the various programs can be used to
    33	read and reply to mail off-line.
    34	
    35	Therefore, it is assumed that you are familiar with the following:
    36	
    37	    1.  ASCII Text Editors
    38	        i.e. QEdit, PEdit, Brief, John Hancock Editor, SLED, TED,
    39	        or perhaps even the one that may be included with your
    40	        communication software.
    41	        (It is best if your text editor can handle two open files
    42	        at the same time.)
    43	
    44	                        or
    45	
    46	    2.  Word Processor that can read/write ASCII files or that
    47	        can convert from/to ASCII format.
    48	        (It is best if your word processor can read/write ASCII
    49	        files without a conversion process and if it can handle
    50	        two open files at the same time.)
    51	
    52	    3.  File compression utilities such as PKWARE's PKZIP and
    53	        PKUNZIP.
    54	
    55	    4.  Your communication software's session capture or session
    56	        logging feature.
    57	
    58	    5.  Downloading a file using ASCII protocol or the protocol
    59	        you selected for use on this BBS.
    60	
    61	    6.  Uploading a file using ASCII protocol.
    62	
    63	If you need help with any of the above, please refer to the
    64	appropriate documentation.  Your Sysops can advise you on the
    65	text editors and file compression utilities available on this BBS
    66	and they can advise you on transfer protocols.
    67	
    68	
    69	In addition, the off-line mail reading program EZ-Reader can be
    70	used to read and reply to mail received from PC Board 14.2/D mail
    71	capture feature or ProDoor 3.1 ZIPM feature.  The utility
    72	programs found in EZUTL10x.ZIP (EZUTL103.ZIP is the latest
    73	release as of this writing) will convert PC Board capture files
    74	and ProDoor ZIPM mail packets into a QMail/MarkMail (*.QWK)
    75	format file readable only by EZ-Reader.
    76	
    77	If you have never used an off-line mail reading program such as
    78	EZ-Reader, I urge you to obtain a copy.  Using an off-line mail
    79	reading program is the most efficient method of all the
    80	techniques presented in this tutorial.
    81	
    82	Unfortunately, other off-line mail reading programs, i.e. QMail
    83	2.01 & 2.02, DeLuxe, cannot be used to read the *.QWK format files
    84	created by EZUTL10x.ZIP.  These other fine off-line mail reading
    85	programs can be used to read the *.QWK mail packets created by
    86	the QMail and MarkMail mail doors.

    91	
    92	Method #1
    93	컴컴컴컴-
    94	
    95	Using your communication program's session capture feature
    96	
    97	
    98	Programs needed:
    99	
   100	Your communication program.
   101	
   102	A text editor
   103	 or
   104	word processor that reads/writes ASCII or converts from/to ASCII
   105	format files.
   106	
   107	        Your text editor or word processor should be able to have
   108	        two files or documents open at the same time and be able
   109	        to copy and paste text between the two files.
   110	
   111	
   112	Overview:
   113	
   114	Most communication software will allow you to capture or log all
   115	incoming characters to a text file.  This file is a simple text
   116	or ASCII file that can be read in several ways.  The technique
   117	described here involves using your communication software's
   118	capture feature to capture all messages non-stop, log off the
   119	BBS, read the capture file (messages) off-line, and prepare
   120	individual replies to be uploaded on your next call.  This method
   121	works with PC Board.  You should refer to your communication
   122	software manual if you need more information about starting and
   123	stopping a capture file.  Please refer to your text editor or
   124	word processor manual for information about converting ASCII
   125	files and working with more than one document at the same time.
   126	
   127	
   128	On-line Procedure:
   129	
   130	Call the BBS and log on as usual.  When the Main Board prompt
   131	appears, open or start your capture file.
   132	
   133	At the Main Board Command? prompt, type  R;A;NS or R A NS or
   134	                                         R;S;NS or R S NS
   135	
   136	R;A;NS and R A NS = R)ead mail in A)ll conferences based on
   137	selection, NS) display text in non-stop mode.
   138	
   139	R;S;NS and R S NS = R)ead mail S)elect messages in current
   140	conference above the last one you have read, NS) display text in
   141	non-stop mode.
   142	
   143	(Refer to PC Board on-line help for a complete explanation of the
   144	commands and options or ask your Sysops for assistance.)
   145	
   146	The messages from the main board message base will scroll
   147	non-stop on your screen and be captured to your capture file.
   148	
   149	When the main board messages have stopped you may join other
   150	conferences and read the messages there using the above commands.
   151	
   152	After you have finished capturing all the messages, close or stop
   153	your capture file.  You may now enjoy other features offered on
   154	the BBS or simply log off.  You will read these messages later,
   155	after you have logged off.
   156	
   157	
   158	Off-line Procedure:
   159	
   160	Use your text editor or word processor to read the capture file.
   161	Some word processors cannot read a text or ASCII file directly.
   162	A conversion process may be required to translate a text or ASCII
   163	file into a format the word processor can read.  Refer to your
   164	word processor manual for information about ASCII file
   165	conversion.
   166	
   167	When you want to reply to a message jot down on paper the
   168	conference number, if applicable, the message number, recipient's
   169	name, subject, and receiver only, if applicable.  Then open a
   170	second file or document giving it a unique file name.  Jot down
   171	this file name with the other data.  Now use the text editor or
   172	word processor to copy and paste quotation text from the capture
   173	file to the reply file and type your reply.  Do not exceed the
   174	maximum line limit for messages as established by the BBS.  After
   175	the reply is completed close or save the reply file.
   176	
   177	When you want to reply to another message repeat the above
   178	procedure except when you open the second file use a
   179	different filename.
   180	
   181	If you want to enter a new message use the above procedure and
   182	again use a different filename for the second file.
   183	
   184	If you are using a word processor that does not read or write
   185	ASCII files directly you will be required to convert each of the
   186	reply files from your word processor's format to ASCII format.
   187	Refer to your word processor manual for information about ASCII
   188	file conversion.
   189	
   190	What you wind up with are several reply files in ASCII format
   191	that you will upload instead of typing your messages on-line on
   192	your next call to the BBS.
   193	
   194	
   195	Next On-line Procedure:
   196	
   197	Call the BBS and log on as usual.  You may use PC Board or open
   198	the ProDoor door.
   199	
   200	At the PC Board main board prompt join the appropriate conference
   201	and REPLY to a message number, i.e. REPLY 135 , or E)nter a
   202	message (Refer to those paper notes for the message number, name,
   203	subject, etc.) and follow the prompts.  If you use ProDoor, do
   204	not use ProDoor's visual editor.  When you are prompted to enter
   205	the first line of your message do not type anything.  At this
   206	point you initiate an upload of the appropriate reply file using
   207	the ASCII protocol.  Sit back and watch the message being typed
   208	for you.  If you're using ProDoor and forget to turn off the
   209	visual editor, the screen will fill with garbage text such as
   210	[6f2[8a4[5h7.  Don't panic!  Let the upload continue!  When the
   211	upload is completed save the message in the usual manner.
   212	
   213	Repeat this procedure for each of the remaining replys or
   214	messages.  Just make sure you are in the correct conference
   215	before you initiate the next reply or message.

   220	Method #2
   221	컴컴컴컴
   222	
   223	Using PC Board Capture File
   224	
   225	
   226	Programs needed:
   227	
   228	Your communication program.
   229	
   230	A text editor
   231	 or
   232	word processor that reads/writes ASCII or converts from/to ASCII
   233	format files.
   234	
   235	        Your text editor or word processor should be able to have
   236	        two files or documents open at the same time and be able
   237	        to copy and paste text between the two files.
   238	
   239	
   240	Overview:
   241	
   242	This method is identical to Method #1 except you will not use
   243	your communication software's session capture feature.  You will
   244	use PC Board's mail capture feature instead.  Replies can be
   245	uploaded to PC Board or to ProDoor.
   246	
   247	
   248	On-line Procedure:
   249	
   250	Call the BBS and log on as usual.
   251	
   252	At the Main Board Command? prompt type R;A;D or R A D or
   253	                                       R;S;D or R S D
   254	
   255	R;A;D and R A D = R)ead messages in A)ll conferences based on
   256	selection D) automatically capture and download read request.
   257	
   258	R;S;D and R S D = R)ead messages S)elect messages in current
   259	conference above the last one you have read D) automatically
   260	capture and download read request.
   261	
   262	PC Board will scan the conference message base for all messages.
   263	These messages will be placed into an ASCII or text file that you
   264	will download using the protocol you selected for use on the BBS.
   265	These ASCII files are free downloads.
   266	
   267	(Refer to PC Board on-line help for a complete explanation of the
   268	commands and options or ask your Sysops for assistance.)
   269	
   270	
   271	Off-line Procedure:
   272	
   273	Follow the procedures presented in Method #1 to read and reply to
   274	these ASCII files.
   275	
   276	
   277	Next On-line Procedure:

   285	Method #3
   286	컴컴컴컴-
   287	
   288	Using ProDoor ZIPM Mail Capture
   289	
   290	
   291	Programs needed:
   292	
   293	Your communication program.
   294	
   295	PKWARE's PKUNZIP file decompression software
   296	
   297	A text editor
   298	 or
   299	word processor that reads/writes ASCII or converts from/to ASCII
   300	format files.
   301	
   302	        Your text editor or word processor should be able to have
   303	        two files or documents open at the same time and be able
   304	        to copy and paste text between the two files.
   305	
   306	
   307	Overview:
   308	
   309	This method is identical to Method #1 except you will not use
   310	your communication software's session capture feature.  You will
   311	use ProDoor's ZIPM mail capture feature instead. ProDoor's ZIPM
   312	will Zip new mail.  ZIPM should capture up to 200 new messages in
   313	selected conferences and then archives them into one file using a
   314	file compression program, usually PKWARE's PKZIP, for smallest
   315	possible download time.  The compressed file is an ASCII or text
   316	file.  You download the file and decompress it. Replies can be
   317	uploaded to PC Board or to ProDoor.
   318	
   319	
   320	On-line Procedure:
   321	
   322	Call the BBS, log on as usual and open the ProDoor door.
   323	
   324	At the ProDoor [Main Board] Command? prompt type ZIPM <conf#>
   325	<conf#> <conf#>  where <conf#> are the conferences you specify.
   326	Example: ZIPM 0 1 4 .
   327	
   328	Other Examples:
   329	  ZIPM N         ;list new messages by conference before capture
   330	  ZIPM A         ;archive mail in all conferences
   331	  ZIPM M 10 14   ;archive mail in main board (M), areas 10 and 14
   332	  ZIPM TOOLS AI  ;archive TOOLS and AI conferences
   333	    Use (L)ast-read command to reset your "last read" message
   334	    pointers.
   335	    Use (J A)uto-config to select message areas in (ZIPM A)ll.
   336	
   337	(Refer to ProDoor's (?) help messages for a complete explanation
   338	of the command details or ask your Sysops for assistance.)
   339	
   340	ZIPM will scan the specified conferences for all messages since
   341	you last logged on and compress them into one file.  You will
   342	download this file using the protocol you selected for use on the
   343	BBS. Do not use ASCII protocol.  This file will be a free
   344	download.
   345	
   346	
   347	Off-line Procedure:
   348	
   349	Decompress this file using the applicable decompression program,
   350	usually PKWARE's PKUNZIP.  Refer to PKWARE's manual for
   351	information about using PKUNZIP.  The decompressed file will be
   352	an ASCII or text file.
   353	
   354	Follow the procedures presented in Method #1 to read and reply to
   355	this ASCII file.
   356	
   357	
   358	Next On-line Procedure:
   359	
   360	Follow the procedures presented in Method #1 to upload your
   361	replies and messages.  You may use PC Board or ProDoor.

   365	
   366	Method #4
   367	컴컴컴컴-
   368	
   369	Use EZ-Reader Utilities (EZUTL103.ZIP) to convert PC Board
   370	Capture File (from Method #2) or ProDoor ZIPM Mail File
   371	(from Method #3) to QMail/MarkMail file format *.QWK.
   372	
   373	
   374	Programs needed:
   375	
   376	Your communication program.
   377	
   378	PKWARE's PKZIP & PKUNZIP file compression software
   379	        
   380	EZ-Reader Utilities EZUTL103.ZIP
   381	
   382	EZ-Reader off-line message management software (EZ124B.ZIP or
   383	higher recommended)
   384	
   385	A text editor to be used with EZ-Reader
   386	
   387	        Your text editor should be able to have two files or
   388	        documents open at the same time and be able to copy and
   389	        paste text between the two files.
   390	
   391	
   392	
   393	Assumption:
   394	
   395	Method #4 assumes that you have used EZ-Reader off-line message
   396	management software.  This tutorial will not teach you how to use
   397	the EZ-Reader program.
   398	
   399	
   400	Overview:
   401	
   402	The utility programs contained in EZ-Reader Utilities EZUTL103.ZIP
   403	
   404	PCB2QWK.EXE
   405	REP2PCB.EXE
   406	ZIPM2QWK.EXE
   407	REP2ZIPM.EXE
   408	
   409	will convert PC Board capture files (from Method #2)
   410	and ProDoor ZIPM mail packets (from Method #3) into
   411	QMail/MarkMail format files *.QWK that can only be read using
   412	EZ-Reader.  Replies and messages created by EZ-Reader will be
   413	converted from QMail/MarkMail format files *.REP to ASCII files
   414	that will be uploaded to PC Board or ProDoor.  Uploads to PC
   415	Board require special scripts for your communication software. A
   416	sample Qmodem script is included in EZUTL103.ZIP.  Uploads to
   417	ProDoor do not require a special script.  They are uploaded at
   418	the [Main Board] Command? prompt using ASCII protocol.
   419	If ProDoor is available use it instead of PC Board.
   420	
   421	
   422	On-line Procedure:
   423	
   424	Follow the procedures in Method #2 to download a PC Board capture
   425	file or Method #3 to download a ProDoor ZIPM mail packet.
   426	
   427	
   428	Off-line Procedure:
   429	
   430	Make sure the PC Board capture file or the ProDoor ZIPM mail
   431	packet is in the download directory you specified in EZ-Reader's
   432	configuration file, the EZ-Reader utilities are in the your
   433	EZ-Reader directory, and that you are in the EZ-Reader directory
   434	when use run the utilities.  PKZIP and PKUNZIP must be located in
   435	the directory you specified in EZ-Reader's configuration file or
   436	must be located in the path.
   437	
   438	
   439	        Converting PC Board capture files:
   440	
   441	        PCB2QWK.EXE converts the PC Board capture file into a
   442	        QMail/MarkMail format file (*.QWK) readable only by
   443	        EZ-Reader.
   444	
   445	        At the DOS prompt, type:
   446	
   447	               PCB2QWK <d:><path>pcb_filename[with no ext]
   448	
   449	        You do not need to type the extension.  PCB2QWK.EXE
   450	        supplies the default extension CAP. The resulting
   451	        Qmail/MarkMail mail packet will be placed in the
   452	        download directory you set in EZ-Reader's
   453	        configuration file.
   454	
   455	        EZ-Reader can not handle more than 200 messages per
   456	        conference.  If you have more than 200 messages per
   457	        conference, you will have to break up the PCB capture file
   458	        into smaller files with less than 200 messages per
   459	        conference before using PCB2QWK.EXE.
   460	
   461	
   462	        Converting ProDoor ZIPM mail packets:
   463	
   464	        ZIPM2QWK.EXE converts the ProDoor ZIPM mail packet file
   465	        into a QMail/MarkMail format file (*.QWK) readable only
   466	        by EZ-Reader.
   467	
   468	        At the DOS prompt, type:
   469	
   470	               ZIPM2QWK <d:><path>zipm_filename[with no ext]
   471	
   472	        You do not need to type the extension.  ZIPM2QWK.EXE
   473	        supplies the default extension ZIP. The resulting
   474	        Qmail/MarkMail mail packet will be placed in the
   475	        download directory you set in EZ-Reader's
   476	        configuration file.
   477	
   478	        ProDoor should only allow you to download 200 messages
   479	        per ZIPM mail packet. Therefore, ZIPM2QWK does not check
   480	        to see if you have more than 200 messages per conference.
   481	
   482	
   483	Use EZ-Reader to read and reply to the resulting *.QWK files.
   484	
   485	
   486	        Converting replies *.REP for uploading:
   487	
   488	        For *.REP packets resulting from a *.QWK that was created
   489	        from a PC Board capture file -
   490	
   491	        REP2PCB.EXE converts reply file (*.REP) created by
   492	        EZ-Reader into an ASCII file that can be uploaded to PC
   493	        Board.  This ASCII file must be uploaded using a script
   494	        that you create using your communications software.
   495	        A sample Qmodem script file is included in EZUTL103.ZIP.
   496	        At the DOS prompt, type:
   497	
   498	               REP2PCB <option> <d:><path>rep_filename[with no ext]
   499	
   500	        You do not need to type the extension.  REP2PCB provides
   501	        the default extension REP.  The resulting ASCII file will
   502	        have an extension PCB and will be placed in the upload
   503	        directory that you set in EZ-Reader's configuration file.
   504	
   505	        The REP2PCB option is preceeded with either the / or -
   506	        characters.  The option can be either upper or lower
   507	        case.  The only option available at this time is
   508	
   509	            E - "This tells REP2PCB to generate the response to
   510	                echo all of the conferences except the Main
   511	                Board.  If you do not use this option and the
   512	                conference is echoed unknown problems will occur.
   513	                It's safer to use the echo option than not.  If
   514	                you use the echo option and the conference is not
   515	                echoed, the only harm is that the first line in
   516	                the message will contain a Y." 1
   517	
   518	                If your BBS echos conference messages to a
   519	                national or international network such as
   520	                InterLink, you should always use the -E switch.
   521	
   522	
   523	
   524	        For *.REP packets resulting from a *.QWK that was created
   525	        from a PorDoor ZIPM mail packet -
   526	
   527	        REP2ZIPM.EXE converts a reply file (*.REP) created by
   528	        EZ-Reader into an ASCII file that can be uploaded
   529	        directly to ProDoor at the ProDoor command prompt using
   530	        ASCII protocol.
   531	
   532	               REP2ZIPM <option> <d:><path>rep_filename[with no ext]
   533	
   534	        You do not need to type the extension.  REP2ZIPM provides
   535	        the default extension REP.  The resulting ASCII file will
   536	        have an extension of ZPM and will be placed in the upload
   537	        directory that you set in EZ-Reader's configuration file.
   538	        To upload this *.ZPM file at the ProDoor command prompt,
   539	        DO NOT TYPE U)pload.  YOU simply initiate the upload with
   540	        YOUR communications software using the ASCII protocol.
   541	        Do not type E)nter, U)pload, or R)ead with Reply to a Msg
   542	        option at the ProDoor command prompt, just initiate the
   543	        upload of the *.ZPM file.
   544	
   545	        The REP2ZIPM option is preceeded with either the / or -
   546	        characters.  The options can be upper or lower case.  The
   547	        only option available at this time is
   548	
   549	            E - "This tells REP2ZIPM to generate the response to
   550	                echo all of the conferences except the Main
   551	                Board." 1
   552	
   553	                If your BBS echos conference messages to a
   554	                national or international network such as
   555	                InterLink, you should always use the -E switch.
   556	
   557	                If ProDoor always asks if you want your messages
   558	                echoed whenever you manually type them, you
   559	                should always use the -E switch.
