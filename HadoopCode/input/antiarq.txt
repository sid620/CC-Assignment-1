     1	Do you know the terror of

     3	                               ARQ-FLASHING ?

     5	I am sure you know....

     7	I have to admit that my method cant remove line-noise but the most
     8	ARQ-Discos are not caused by a bad line but by a slow retrain of the HST.

    10	You start the upload and the first thing happening is: CS-led off and the
    11	ARQ-led is flashing. (I know you cry "Yes, yes") Ok normaly it will take
    12	a long time to finish flashing or it will never finish. What can I do
    13	against this? Its pretty simple: Try to keep your computer away from 
    14	sending (just as long as the ARQ is flashing).
    15	How can you do this? If you use NCOMM, you have just to click the Transmit-
    16	Window (just as you want to move it). The border of the window will be
    17	inverted. Hold this position until the disco is over. Repeat this if
    18	the disco starts again.

    20	I know this is a very ify-english:-)

    31	    from sending, leave me a msg (or an OLM:-) and I will code a short tool.
