     1	DMA Techniques for Personal Computer Data Acquisition
     2	
     3	Introduction
     4	
     5	Data  acquisition generally involves sampling some set  of  "real 
     6	world"  signals  at a regular rate, and storing the  results  for 
     7	processing and display. Enhanced with data acquisition  hardware, 
     8	a  personal  computer is an excellent vehicle for  this  sort  of 
     9	activity. It can contain all the elements of the data acquisition 
    10	system--system  control,  data storage,  data  manipulation,  and 
    11	report  generation--at  low  cost. The  ubiquitous  IBM  PC  (and 
    12	compatibles)  is an excellent choice because of the  richness  of 
    13	hardware and software enhancement products available for it.
    14	
    15	There are three basic techniques available for accomplishing  the 
    16	sampling  task -- polling, interrupts, and DMA, or Direct  Memory 
    17	Access.  While  the main thrust of this discussion  is  DMA,  the 
    18	other two techniques deserve mention.
    19	
    20	Using   the  polling  technique,  the  data  acquisition   system 
    21	generates  a  clock pulse to signal the computer  to  sample  the 
    22	data.  The  clock can either be a stable, regular  pulse  from  a 
    23	crystal  oscillator,  or  it can be generated  by  some  external 
    24	event.  The  computer's  program is in a loop  waiting  for  this 
    25	clock.  At each occurrence, it samples and stores the data.  This 
    26	technique  has the advantage of being very simple  to  implement, 
    27	and quite fast (up to 200,000 12-bit samples/sec in a '386  based 
    28	machine  using  assembly  language). The  major  disadvantage  of 
    29	polling   is  that  it  monopolizes  the  computer  during   data 
    30	acquisition.  Even the PC's keyboard and clock interrupts must be 
    31	disabled to avoid missing data samples.
    32	
    33	Interrupt-driven  data  acquisition also requires  some  sort  of 
    34	clock signal to indicate when it is time to sample and store  the 
    35	data.  In  this  case, however, the  clock  signal  generates  an 
    36	interrupt  to the PC, and the interrupt handling routine  samples 
    37	and  stores  the  data. The computer is not  in  a  program  loop 
    38	waiting  for the clock. This overcomes the major disadvantage  of 
    39	polling  -- the computer is free for other tasks as well as  data 
    40	acquisition.  Each time the processor receives an  interrupt,  it 
    41	has  to  save the contents of all its registers, so that  it  can 
    42	pick  up  where  it left off when  it  returns.  This  additional 
    43	overhead makes interrupts much slower than polling (around  10000 
    44	12-bit samples/sec in a similar machine). An interrupt routine is 
    45	also  much more difficult to implement in software.  Finally,  in 
    46	order  to maintain a gap-free regular data acquisition  rate,  it 
    47	may  still  be necessary to disable the PC's clock  and  keyboard 
    48	interrupts. 
    49	
    50	The  third  data acquisition technique is Direct  Memory  Access. 
    51	Using this technique, the data acquisition hardware sends data to 
    52	( or receives data from) the computer's memory directly. DMA also 
    53	uses  a  clock  signal as do the other two  techniques.  In  both 
    54	polling and interrupt driven data acquisition, however, the  data 
    55	is  retrieved  from the hardware and transferred into  memory  by 
    56	computer  instructions in the user's program. DMA is a method  by 
    57	which the hardware takes control of the computer's data, address, 
    58	and  control busses, and interacts with memory  directly  without 
    59	processor  intervention (See Fig. 1). Each time the sample  clock 
    60	"ticks", data is directly inserted into memory.
    61	
    62	Since  it proceeds without software intervention, DMA is  also  a 
    63	fast  method of acquiring data -- speeds of up to 180,000  12-bit 
    64	samples  per second can be achieved on a PC/XT. It also  has  the 
    65	advantage  of  operating  as a true background  task.  Since  the 
    66	user's  program  does  not  have to deal  with  the  business  of 
    67	acquiring  each  sample, it is free to perform other  tasks.  The 
    68	computer's keyboard and timer interrupts can remain active  since 
    69	they will not affect DMA operation.
    70	
    71	DMA in Data Acquisition
    72	
    73	Personal   computers   were  originally  designed   to   increase 
    74	productivity in office automation applications.  Among the  first 
    75	software  products to appear were word processors,  spreadsheets, 
    76	and  database managers. The fundamental difference between  these 
    77	sorts of applications and Data Acquisition is the extent to which 
    78	they  must react to the "real world." 
    79	
    80	Office  automation  software  responds to  inputs  from  a  human 
    81	operator  --  generally keystrokes. The  potential  frequency  of 
    82	these inputs is very low compared to the processing speed of  the 
    83	computer,  even for the fastest typist in the world. This is  not 
    84	the case in Data Acquisition.
    85	
    86	Consider a system capturing an audio frequency input from an  A/D 
    87	converter. To achieve a bandwidth of 20 KHz, such a system  would 
    88	need to sample the input at 40,000 samples/sec, or once every  25 
    89	microseconds.  If the input is sampled at a frequency lower  than 
    90	twice the signal frequency, "aliasing" errors will occur. In this 
    91	case,   higher  frequency  components  of  the   input   waveform 
    92	"masquerade"  as lower frequency components, causing  potentially 
    93	significant errors in signal re-construction. 
    94	
    95	A good typist may enter 5 to 8 characters per second through  the 
    96	keyboard  --  three orders of magnitude in frequency  below  what 
    97	would   be  required  of  the  data  acquisition   system.   Data 
    98	Acquisition, then, is very much a "real time" activity, and speed 
    99	of  response is a critical concern. DMA is a good way to  provide 
   100	this  speed  without seriously taxing the computer's  ability  to 
   101	perform other tasks.
   102	
   103	It  is not enough, however, to acquire a signal very quickly.  In 
   104	order  to  accurately reconstruct a waveform, one must  know  not 
   105	only the value of a signal, but also the time at which the signal 
   106	was sampled. The simplest way to know the time at which a  sample 
   107	was taken is to take all the samples at a regular rate. The  time 
   108	of  any  given sample can then be computed by knowing  the  exact 
   109	time between samples.
   110	
   111	This method of sampling depends heavily on the sample rate  being 
   112	extremely  regular.  Variations in  sample-to-sample  timing,  or 
   113	"jitter",  can lead to significant errors. Consider a 1 KHz  sine 
   114	wave at 20 V peak-to-peak being sampled by a 12-bit A/D converter 
   115	with  a timing uncertainty of only 1 usec. At worst case  (around 
   116	0V  where  the rate of change of the sine wave is  highest),  the 
   117	error generated by such an uncertainty would be:
   118	
   119	Error Voltage = 10*SIN(2*pi*f*1 usec) = 62.8 mv
   120	
   121	The  12-bit A/D will divide the 20 V full scale input range  into 
   122	4096  equal  parts  or  "counts".  An  error  of  62.8  mv  would 
   123	correspond to 
   124	
   125	.0628 V * (4096 counts / 20 V) = 12.9 counts!
   126	
   127	Such an error reduces the system accuracy to about what would  be 
   128	expected  of an eight bit system. Clearly, this could  easily  be 
   129	the  most  significant error in the system.  The  maximum  timing 
   130	jitter allowable that would give 1/2 count or less of error for a 
   131	12 bit system would be:
   132	
   133	T = ARCSIN(Error Voltage / Volts Full Scale) / 2*pi*f  
   134	
   135	In this case
   136	
   137	T = ARCSIN(.00244 V/10) / 2*pi*1000 = 39 nsec !
   138	
   139	The only way to achieve such stability in a computer is to have a 
   140	clock  derived  from  a crystal  oscillator  directly  start  A/D 
   141	conversions. The DMA process would then be paced by the A/D's End 
   142	of Convert Signal to ensure that only valid data are transferred. 
   143	DMA  for data acquisition, then, must be paced by a very  regular 
   144	clock.
   145	
   146	Besides  being more demanding in terms of frequency  than  office 
   147	automation,  data  acquisition must also be "event driven"  to  a 
   148	much  greater  extent. That is, it must respond  and  synchronize 
   149	itself to asynchronous events over which it may have little or no 
   150	control. 
   151	
   152	Often,  it  is not useful to take a random "snapshot"  of  10,000 
   153	precisely timed samples of a signal. Often, one would really like 
   154	to take a snapshot only of the 10,000 samples which contain  some 
   155	event  of  interest. In these cases, the optimal  snapshot  would 
   156	contain  data  leading up to the event, and  data  following  the 
   157	event -- pre- and post-trigger data. The technique for  achieving 
   158	this  is  well  known, and requires three  basic  elements  --  a 
   159	"circular"  memory buffer, some sort of hardware trigger,  and  a 
   160	delay counter.
   161	
   162	Data is acquired continuously into the circular buffer. When  the 
   163	buffer is full, it automatically wraps around and begins  filling 
   164	again,  overwriting old data with new. When the hardware  trigger 
   165	occurs, the delay counter begins counting a pre-programmed number 
   166	of additional samples. When the delay counter exhausts its count, 
   167	data  acquisition stops.  The buffer is left with  samples  taken 
   168	both before and after the trigger (Fig. 2). The oldest sample  in 
   169	the buffer is the one which would have been written next if  data 
   170	acquisition  had  continued. The newest sample is  the  one  just 
   171	written,  and  the trigger sample is located by  going  backwards 
   172	through the buffer by the number of samples in the delay.
   173	
   174	This  capability is partially inherent in the Personal  Computer.  
   175	Its   DMA  Controller  has an  "Autoinitialize  Mode",  described 
   176	below, which can be used to create the required circular  buffer.  
   177	The hardware trigger and delay counter, however, must be built in 
   178	to  the  data  acquisition  hardware.  The  Burr-Brown  PCI-20000 
   179	Modular  Data  Acquisition  System was the  first  PC-based  data 
   180	acquisition   system   to  offer  this  capability.   All   major 
   181	competitors in this area now offer some capablities like this.

   186	Survey of DMA Techniques
   187	
   188	The classical DMA technique which is supported by the IBM  family 
   189	of  PCs  is the "device to memory" technique. A  single  external 
   190	device  (for data acquisition, normally an A/D or D/A  converter) 
   191	communicates   with   the  host  computer's  memory   using   the 
   192	computer's DMA handshaking protocol. Fig. 3 shows a simple  block 
   193	diagram and memory map of this process.
   194	
   195	For  purposes of data acquisition, this technique is  illustrated 
   196	in its simplest form in Fig. 4. An external timing source  starts 
   197	an A/D conversion directly. When the conversion is complete,  the 
   198	A/D's data is transmitted directly to memory.  While this process 
   199	is  very fast, it has the disadvantage that only one  channel  of 
   200	analog data is captured and transmitted. There are no  provisions 
   201	for  multiple channels of analog data, or for any other  type  of 
   202	data.
   203	
   204	The addition of a multiplexer and programmable counter, as  shown 
   205	in  Fig. 5, allows the acquisition of multiple  analog  channels. 
   206	Conversions are still started by the external timing source. Now, 
   207	however,  when  a  conversion starts, the  counter  advances  the 
   208	multiplexer  to the next channel in the sequence.  Advancing  the 
   209	counter at the start of conversion rather than at the end  allows 
   210	the  multiplexer to settle on the next channel while the  current 
   211	channel is converting. The sample/hold amplifier stores the value 
   212	of  the  current  channel  while the  current  conversion  is  in 
   213	progress. The counter can be made such that it can scan the first 
   214	N  channels  in  sequence, or the last N channels.  Each  time  a 
   215	conversion   starts,  a  different  channel  is   converted   and 
   216	transmitted.  Some  technique  similar to  this  is  employed  on 
   217	virtually all modern DMA-compatible data acquisition boards.
   218	
   219	 
   220	Another  level  of utility can be achieved by inserting  a  "list 
   221	memory" between the counter and the multiplexer (Fig. 6). Instead 
   222	of selecting an analog channel, the counter will select a  memory 
   223	location in the list memory. This memory location can contain the 
   224	code  for  any  channel, as well as the code for  a  gain,  if  a 
   225	programmable gain amplifier is used in the system. As above, each 
   226	time  a  conversion starts, the counter advances. In  this  case, 
   227	however,  it  advances  to  the next  memory  location,  and  the 
   228	contents of that memory location specify the channel for the next 
   229	conversion.  
   230	
   231	This technique offers several advantages. The list of channels to 
   232	be  scanned  does not have to be sequential. Any  random  channel 
   233	numbers can be programmed in the list. 
   234	
   235	If  some channels need to be scanned at higher  frequencies  than 
   236	others,  they can be repeated in the list. For  example,  suppose 
   237	channels 7, 2, and 5 were to be scanned, and channel 2  contained 
   238	higher  frequency information than the other two. A channel  list 
   239	could  be constructed to look like: 2,7,2,5. Channel 2  would  be 
   240	scanned at twice the rate of the others.
   241	
   242	If  a programmable gain amplifier is used in the system, and  its 
   243	control  bits are included in the list memory, then each  channel 
   244	can  have a different gain. Normally, this is not possible  under 
   245	DMA control since gain has to be set with software.
   246	
   247	The  random-channel  scanner  first  appeared  in  PC-based  data 
   248	acquisition  products  in 1985, again in  Burr-Brown's  PCI-20000 
   249	system.  Since  that  time, it has  become  available  from  most 
   250	suppliers of such boards.
   251	
   252	A New Technique
   253	
   254	All of the techniques listed above are available in  commercially 
   255	available  plug-in data acquisition boards. All of these  schemes 
   256	have  one limitation in common, however: they can only monitor  a 
   257	single  A/D  converter under DMA control, and no  other  type  of 
   258	device at all. 
   259	
   260	Almost  all  data  acquisition boards  have  event  counters  and 
   261	digital I/O on board as well as an A/D converter. This is because 
   262	most  applications  involve more than  simply  monitoring  analog 
   263	channels.  For  example, if an application  requires  correlating 
   264	analog  inputs  with  a position signal from  an  absolute  shaft 
   265	encoder,  then  DMA  cannot be used. The  analog  inputs  can  be 
   266	monitored  under  DMA control, but the digital  inputs  from  the 
   267	shaft encoder cannot.
   268	
   269	Alternatively,  if an application requires simultaneous  sampling 
   270	from  several A/D converters, or to several D/A converters,  then 
   271	DMA could not be used. Only one of the converters could be  under 
   272	DMA control.
   273	
   274	A technique has been developed that gets around this  limitation. 
   275	Embodied  in the Burr-Brown PCI-20041C Data Acquisition  Carrier, 
   276	it  allows several (up to 64) data acquisition devices  to  share 
   277	the  same DMA channel in the PC. Any device in the system can  be 
   278	used -- A/D converters, digital I/O channels, and/or counters  -- 
   279	and they can be mixed together in the same DMA process.
   280	
   281	The  scheme  involves a technique similar to  the  random-channel 
   282	scanner  described above. RAM on the Carrier contains a  list  of 
   283	all  items to be transferred under DMA control.  Each time a  DMA 
   284	transfer  is  requested  (by a pacer  clock,  for  example),  the 
   285	Carrier sends out one "frame" consisting of all the items in  the 
   286	list to a single DMA channel as fast as the computer will  accept 
   287	them.   This frame can consist of any mixture of items  available 
   288	on the Carrier or Modules; A/D readings, digital input  readings, 
   289	and counter data can be intermixed as required (see Fig. 7).   Up 
   290	to  five  Carriers  can be linked  together  in  a  master-slaves 
   291	arrangement, allowing data from all five to be under DMA  control 
   292	simultaneously. 
   293	
   294	The DMA list, or frame map, is contained in a block of 128  bytes 
   295	of  memory on the Carrier. Each item in the map consists  of  two 
   296	bytes   representing  the  local  address  of  one  item  to   be 
   297	transferred  under DMA control. There can be up to 64 such  items 
   298	in the list. The last item in the frame also contains an "End  Of 
   299	Frame" flag indicating the end of the list (Fig. 8). 
   300	
   301	During  a  DMA transfer, the PC's address and control  lines  are 
   302	removed  from  the  Carrier's local bus, and  replaced  with  the 
   303	contents of one element from the list. This addresses one byte on 
   304	the  Carrier, causing its data to be placed on the data  bus  (or 
   305	taken from the data bus, depending on the direction of transfer). 
   306	When  the  transfer  of the byte is complete, a  counter  on  the 
   307	Carrier  advances  to  the next item in the  list  for  the  next 
   308	transfer.  After  the last item is transferred,  the  counter  is 
   309	reset, pointing once again to the first list element.
   310	
   311	A DMA transfer can be requested by several sources in the system. 
   312	Typical  sources  of  transfer requests are the  End  of  Convert 
   313	signal  from an A/D converter, a pulse from the on-board  crystal 
   314	controlled  Pacer  clock,  an external TTL  input  pulse,  or  an 
   315	interrupt from a Trigger circuit.
   316	
   317	There are also several triggering methods available to start  and 
   318	stop  sequences  of  DMA transfers. For  data  acquisition  input 
   319	purposes, the method described earlier ( called Start on Command, 
   320	Stop  on  Trigger with Delay) is most useful  since  it  provides 
   321	both  pre-and  post-trigger data. In this case, the  trigger  can 
   322	either  be an external TTL pulse, or it can be  derived  directly 
   323	from  the analog input signal using a PCI-20020M-1  Trigger/Alarm 
   324	Module.
   325	
   326	For  continuous  DMA  output  of  analog  waveforms  or   digital 
   327	patterns,  the "Start on Command, Stop on Command" mode  is  most 
   328	useful. It also involves the use of a circular buffer. An  analog 
   329	waveform  can  be constructed in memory,  and  then  continuously 
   330	output through a D/A converter module (or several modules if more 
   331	than one waveform is desired) at the desired frequency using DMA. 
   332	An alternative mode allows the DMA output to begin on a  hardware 
   333	trigger.  During  the DMA output,  a user's program  can  acquire 
   334	data from the same board using a polling or interrupt  technique.  
   335	If  polled  data acquisition is timed by the same clock  used  to 
   336	generate the DMA output, then the two are synchronized. This  can 
   337	be used to build a stimulus-response system.
   338	
   339	Conclusion
   340	
   341	DMA is a powerful technique for data acquisition. It allows  high 
   342	speed data collection, and it makes background operation  simple. 
   343	When  enhanced by specialized data acquisition hardware,  it  can 
   344	transform   a  Personal  Computer  into  a   full-featured   Data 
   345	Acquisition System with impressive capabilities.
