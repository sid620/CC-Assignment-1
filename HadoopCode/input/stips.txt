     3	This text contains some informations and tips regarding dos problems/
     4	sessions. Some might find this really boring, so if you suspect you already
     5	know all this, skip this message right away.... If you DON'T know so much
     6	about dos and it's hazzles, you might want to read this. I found out that
     7	several I know, haven't figured these tips out already! The tips explained
     8	here ranges from VERY elementary to a bit technical, so if it's top obvious to
     9	you, don't say that you haven't been warned!
    10	
    11	The purpose of this text is to inform. Most of this information is documented,
    12	but a few tricks are not. Even the tricks that are documented are often
    13	hard to find and understand. This guide might help you to get the most
    14	valuable information, without reading and "decoding" all your manuals.. =*)

    23	HISTORY:
    24	
    25	[blahblah]	-	The contents between []'s are to be replaced with
    26				something suitable, like a program name...
    27	%a		-	Internal variable used by dos, replace if already
    28				in use by dos.
    29	%%a		-	Also an internal variable, except for the fact that
    30				%%a is required within a batch file, by lame
    31				command.com ofcourse. Stick with 4dos.
    32	;		-	Comments. Not to by typed.
    33	
    34	()		-	In the text, this contains comments.
    35				In the syntax'es, it means that the parameter
    36				is optional.
    37	
    38	{}		-	Only the contents is to be concidered as the
    39				command line.

    53	Anyway here goes... Scorpio's Universal Tips Guide v1.23! .....................
    54	
    55	(Hope you don't mind the spelling errors... I Hope you can live with it...)
    56	
    57	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ

    59	If you can't afford hd-floppy disks, and still use floppies, buy
    60	dd ones, and drill a hole in the upper left corner where the hole for hd
    61	disks usually is. (old trick)
    62	
    63	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
    64	
    65	pressing ctrl+p has a devastating effect on those people that don't own a
    66	printer. Nothing will happen until you press another key. You might want
    67	to avoid this.
    68	
    69	This is actually turning printer echo on and off. Press ctrl+p, and
    70	what you type, will appear on the printer. If printer connection is not
    71	made, some os'es will refuse to turn back to dos!
    72	
    73	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
    74	
    75	If your computer uses really long time to check your disks when booting, and
    76	then i mean REALLY long time, create a program in the boot sector which jumps
    77	to your hd of your choice. A slight modification allows you to boot from
    78	different harddisks! If you can't code that, do this:
    79	
    80	put a disk in drive a: which you won't need for dos sessions anymore.
    81	(though you CAN use the rest of the disk as raw storage - tricky, not
    82	 recommended........)
    83	
    84	a:
    85	c:\dos\debug
    86	l100 2 0 1
    87	w100 0 0 1
    88	q
    89	
    90	Of course, this won't have any real impact on machines other than most
    91	286, 186 and 808[6/8], plus the v30 and other slow machines....
    92	
    93	This trick only copies the boot sector of your hd to a fd! Replace the number
    94	"2" with any number, but not bigger than the number that corresponds with Z
    95	a=0 b=1 c=2 d=3. (You get the idea?)
    96	
    97	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
    98	
    99	a ctrl+[the C button] and a ctrl+[the BREAK button (really the pause)]
   100	is sometimes treated different. But it's really a general rule,
   101	if you want normal break of a program, and you want to let it end and clean
   102	up normal, you press ctrl+c. If you want INSTANT break, press ctrl+[break]
   103	rapidly, which sometimes is more powerful than the normal ctrl+c...
   104	
   105	Some programs even let you break the break process! This is a tricky bug,
   106	that usually appears in dos programs that exploit DPMI. Remember to press
   107	ctrl+c ONCE, and wait. If you press ctrl+c (or break) rapidly, you might
   108	hang the program, and dos itself...
   109	
   110	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
   111	
   112	Write a INT28 handler to allow processing while dos is IDLE. Remember to
   113	write your code 100% in conjunction with what microsoft says, or else something
   114	that works fine with you might not work on another machine, or may not work
   115	at all with Chicago... When dos is finished with it's core work, it's just
   116	sitting IDLE and checking for keypresses. You don't need so quick key-response,
   117	so do something useful in the background instead....
   118	{kinda technical, or what?}
   119	
   120	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
   121	
   122	use 4dos! use 4dos! use 4dos! or AT LEAST any CLI program to replace
   123	command.com, Virtually EVERYTHING is better than command.com.
   124	You can find 4dos on selected of BBS'es... If you can't afford the money you
   125	would have to spend on 4dos, use ndos if you own it. It's a souped-up version
   126	of 4dos, but as always... The original is better. NDOS is a part of the
   127	newer norton utilities packages.
   128	
   129	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
   130	
   131	If you use UMB's, AND own a 24-bit coloured-card (or 16bit), you might find
   132	out that you can run into trouble in some of your videocards exotic modes...
   133	Checking out your manual isn't always going to help you, since it usually
   134	tells you to exclude out the entire C0000-F0000 area, or does not say anything
   135	at all. Send your video-card through ALL the modes it's got, and write down
   136	every 4k block of memory it has been accessing. You might loose some
   137	UMB-memory, but you will at least (Let's hope so) loose your memory conflict
   138	problems too.
   139	
   140	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
   141	
   142	Format your fd's with sector sliding...
   143	If you can't do it yourself, let a program do it for you, (like fdformat).
   144	If you can't guess the best sector/track values, run test benchmarks
   145	and measure the time used to format disks.
   146	
   147	You can do this in a batch file. REALLY!!! I did it!
   148	
   149	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
   150	
   151	Pkzip files or directories directly to a ram drive. Now that's performance!
   152	You can create a batch file to pkzip all files in a directory and below
   153	+hidden/system +extra compression +automatically testing of zip file
   154	fits destination +automatically moving. All in a batch file! (It works....!)
   155	The packing speed usually rises from about 20-30k a second to 100-150k!
   156	I recommend a real 32bit ramdrive.
   157	(This applies of course only if your PC has 32-bit capabilities)
   158	Don't use the lame ramdrive supplied with msdos.....
   159	
   160	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
   161	
   162	You can improve your PC's performace by several hundred percent!
   163	(According to benchmark programs, that is....)
   164	Start Windows, and open a full-scale dos window, or shell to dos
   165	from a time-slicing product, then run Norton SI, or another benchmark product.
   166	I got 260 on norton SI, and according to landmark I have a 522 Mhz
   167	machine! According to CoreTest, a hard-drive benchmarking program, my hd
   168	delivers 16 megz per second and have a -0.1 track to track seek time!
   169	How's that! The controller delivers information even before any program
   170	requested it! WOOOW! That's intelligent!
   171	hehehe........, talk about dream machine, or what!
   172	
   173	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
   174	
   175	Ok, I guess i have said enough already....
   176	Most of the above mentioned programs are usually located in several bbs'es.
   177	Call the biggest one near you, and ask someone for it! I think I only have
   178	mentioned shareware programs here...., so they should all be available to
   179	the public... You will definitely find it on the internet. There is a great
   180	deal of utilityprograms for msdos at SIMTEL20. Can't remember the address,
   181	though..... =(
   182	
   183	If you want to contact me for comments or questions, do so and leave a
   184	message to me on a bbs. Preferably soundserver, Don't send any comments that
   185	are really not neccesary, or obvious. I get enough mail by modem already.....
   186	
   187	Soundserver has numbers of +47-22-57-16-XX, where XX applies to 00 and 04.
   188	
   189	Ok, I guess this have come to an end.
