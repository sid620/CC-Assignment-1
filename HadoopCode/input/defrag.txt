     2	                   DEFRAGMENTING A DOUBLESPACED DRIVE
     3	          
     4	          The DoubleSpace DEFRAGment command is used on a DoubleSpaced
     5	          compressed drive. The program doesn't really defragment the
     6	          drive, however it does consolidate the free space.   Do this at
     7	          least once a month.  It should be considered routine hard drive
     8	          maintenance.  First use the CHKDSK command.
     9	             
    10	          1.   Change to the compressed drive and then issue a CHKDSK
    11	               command like so:
    12	               
    13	                         c: <ENTER>
    14	                              
    15	                         chkdsk /f <ENTER>
    16	          
    17	               The /F tells DOS to fix errors. 
    18	          
    19	               Another option is to do it like so:
    20	          
    21	                         dblspace /chkdsk /f  <ENTER>
    22	               
    23	               A shortcut for the DBLSPACE /CHKDSK /F command is:
    24	          
    25	                         dblspace /chk /f  <ENTER>
    26	          
    27	          2.   Defragmenting a large hard drive can take a very long
    28	               time.  To consolidate a DoubleSpace compressed drive,
    29	               change to the compressed drive and then issue a command
    30	               like so:
    31	          
    32	                         dblspace /defragment <ENTER>
    33	               
    34	               A shortcut for the above command is:
    35	               
    36	                         dblspace /def <ENTER>
    37	          
    38
