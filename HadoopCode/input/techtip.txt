     1	The following tips were retrieved from the Micropolis BBS as tech tips
     2	which their support team uses in resolving customer issues. 
     3	
     4	1.   Ultrastor 12F when installing NETWARE 2.15A                  
     5	     Low-level format using the physical parameters(no            
     6	     translation) to use the full capacity of Micropolis drives   
     7	     that exceed 1024 cylinders. Install Advanced Netware 2.15A   
     8	     using the "Default" configuration.
     9	
    10	2.   Ultrastor 12F in EISA machines.
    11	     To configure an Ultrastor 12F in an EISA bus you must use the
    12	     file USC0120.CFG located on the ultrastor diskettes.
    13	
    14	3.   WD1007x 
    15	     Say "NO" to "enable alternate sectors?" during low-level the
    16	     format. The use of alternate sectors will disable WD1007x  63
    17	     sector translation mode.  *NOTE* alternate sectors may be
    18	     enabled when no translation will be required.
    19	
    20	4.   WD1007v-SE1/SE2
    21	     Models 1568-15 and 1664-7 must have the W2 jumper removed from
    22	     the drive.  Removing the W2 jumpers changes the drive geometry
    23	     from 54 to 53 spt. The WD1007V does NOT support 54 spt.
    24	
    25	5.   SCSI 
    26	     The drive and host adapter must have different SCSI ID's.
    27	     Conflicting SCSI ID's will cause a variety of problems.
    28	
    29	6.   ESDI Drive Splitting
    30	     Enabling drive splitting with ESDI controllers will limit the
    31	     system to one physical EDSI drive. The computer CMOS must be
    32	     set for two physical drives set to type (Type 1)
    33	
    34	7.   ESDI 
    35	     When using ESDI controllers and drives, you must be sure that
    36	     the controller has a transfer rate equal to or higher than the
    37	     drive. Eg.. WD1007A is a 10 Megahertz controller, with a 1664-
    38	     7 which is a 15 Megahertz drive. This is an incompatible mix.
    39	
    40	8.   UltraStor and Netware
    41	     UltraStor 12/f is certified for Netware 2.2 and Netware 386
    42	     v3.11 with the Rev 009 bios on the controller.
    43	
    44	9.   In-2000 Synchronous negotiation 
    45	     Set SW-8 to "ON" position to force the IN-2000 to initiate 
    46	     synchronous negotiation.
    47	
    48	10.  HS Code
    49	     HS code supports 512 bytes per sector only. This applies to
    50	     firmware P/N  800574-XX-X. 
    51	
    52	11.  RS6000
    53	     HSP4 (800574-03-0) will issue an Illegal request in
    54	     CDB(05/24h) when formatted with AIX "Service and Diagnostics
    55	     Module". ASOC must be used in an IBM RS6000 machines. HS code
    56	     doesn't support a command issued by the RS6000.
    57	
    58	12. Future Domain 1680 Host Adapter
    59	    Disk Manager will not initialize a drive over 1.2 gigabytes.  
    60	    You must use have a bios revision of 2.0 and higher for the   
    61	    Future Domain 1680. You must use Disk Maestro or Debug to     
    62	    format the drives.
    63	
    64	13. SCO UNIX
    65	    The boot partition must reside under 1024 cylinders or you will 
    66	    have erratic behavior of the OS.
    67	
    68	14. Ultra 12f-24 with Two drives
    69	    When a 1518-15 is attached to the 12f and additional drive will 
    70	    be will be added , the bios on the Ultrastor should be Rev.   
    71	    -010.
    72	
    73	15. DPT / MYLEX WITH 1598 AND 1528
    74	    The firmware on the drives must be DD24_1 to work with DPT and 
    75	    Mylex Host Adapters.
    76	
    77	16. PS2 Model 95 and 1528 
    78	    Configure automatically with the reference diskette and the   
    79	    utility will return '????' as the 2nd drive.  
    80	    After configuration, the drive will respond normally.
    81	
    82	17. Always and UNIX / XENIX
    83	    If a customer has problems creating the N1 boot diskette, the 
    84	    customer can call Always and they will create the N1 diskette 
    85	    for the customer.
    86	
    87	18. WESTERN DIGITAL 7000FASST
    88	    The WD7000FASST host adapter does not support parity.         
    89	    Micropolis drives must have parity disabled by placing a jumper 
    90	    on W9 on the 1674 /1684 or w4 on 1578/1588/1598/1528. On the  
    91	    models 1548/1908/1624 drives to disable parity jumper in 13-14 
    92	    in the J2 connector. (Download the drive spec sheet from the  
    93	    files section of the BBS).
    94	
    95	19. ULTRASTOR(ALL CONTROLLERS)
    96	    Ultrasor ESDI controllers will not co-reside with any other   
    97	    manufacturers controller card under Netware.
    98
