   605	                              How to read this catalog
   606	
   607	          ASP members have supplied product descriptions for each shareware
   608	          application they offer.  The catalog groups them by subject
   609	          matter and lists them alphabetically.  If you want to know the
   610	          name/address/phone for the author of a particular program, turn
   611	          to the index and look for the program by name.  You'll usually
   612	          see two page references: one describes the page where you read
   613	          about the program, the other mentions the page where you can find
   614	          information about the author (in Appendix A).  Just turn to the
   615	          appropriate page and scan for the name of the program.
   616	
   617	          The Association of Shareware Professionals does NOT rate members'
   618	          software for functionality or usefulness, nor can it attest to
   619	          the validity of any product description in this catalog.  That is
   620	          for you - the user - to decide.  Shareware, especially those
   621	          products authorized to carry the ASP logo, can be tested on a
   622	          "try before you buy" basis.  If the software doesn't meet your
   623	          needs, you won't have to worry about getting a refund.  (That's
   624	          the beauty of the shareware marketing concept.)
   625	
   626	
   627	          1.1  Minimum requirements
   628	
   629	          Every program description lists its computer and operating system
   630	          requirements (e.g. "IBM PC, DOS 2.0 or better").  Unless noted
   631	          otherwise, each program assumes you have a standard keyboard,
   632	          monitor, printer, and either two floppy drives or a hard disk.
   633	          And unless noted otherwise, programs written for the IBM PC
   634	          assume you have at least 512k of total installed RAM.  Many pro-
   635	          grams may also need specific hardware or software such as:
   636	             CD-ROM drive
   637	                         A device capable of reading CD-ROMs.  A CD-ROM
   638	                         looks just like a regular compact disk with music
   639	                         on it, but it has information on it only a
   640	                         computer's CD-ROM drive can read.
   641	             CGA monitor A video monitor capable of displaying CGA
   642	                         graphics.  This includes most "laptop CGA"
   643	                         computers, plus higher resolution monitors such as
   644	                         the EGA or VGA.  Some (but not all) of the
   645	                         described programs may operate correctly with a
   646	                         Hercules monitor if you use a "CGA simulator"
   647	                         program; consult your video monitor manual for
   648	                         details.
   649	             Dual 720k disk drives
   650	                         At least two floppy drives capable of writing at
   651	                         least 720k of data per disk, or, preferably, a
   652	                         hard disk (see below).

   656	
   657	
   658	             EGA monitor A video monitor capable of displaying EGA
   659	                         graphics.  This almost always includes VGA and
   660	                         other higher-resolution monitors.  CGA and
   661	                         Hercules monitors won't suffice.
   662	             EMS memory  Memory accessible via the Lotus-Intel-Microsoft
   663	                         Expanded Memory Specification.  Not to be confused
   664	                         with expanded memory, extended memory, or XMS
   665	                         memory (see below).  Windows, OS/2, and newer
   666	                         versions of DOS come with software designed to
   667	                         implement EMS memory on computers with enough
   668	                         installed memory.
   669	             Epson printer
   670	                         A printer capable of recognizing the Epson print
   671	                         command set (an industry standard).  Some
   672	                         printers, including some laser printers, have
   673	                         options to behave like an Epson printer.  Some
   674	                         programs may require a specific model such as the
   675	                         Epson MX-80 or FX-100.
   676	             Hard disk   A fixed-, removable-, or network-drive device
   677	                         capable of storing multiple megabytes of data.
   678	                         Some programs also assume you have at least one
   679	                         floppy drive in addition to the hard disk.
   680	             Hercules monitor
   681	                         A video monitor capable of displaying Hercules
   682	                         graphics.  CGA, EGA, VGA, & SVGA monitors won't
   683	                         suffice.
   684	             HP DeskJet  A Hewlett-Packard DeskJet or compatible printer.
   685	                         Some programs may require a DeskJet starting with
   686	                         a specific model such as the DeskJet Plus or
   687	                         having a specific feature like a RAM cartridge.
   688	             HP LaserJet A Hewlett-Packard LaserJet or compatible printer.
   689	                         (HP DeskJet printers recognize most, but not all,
   690	                         of the HP LaserJet command set.)  Some programs
   691	                         may require a specific model such as the LaserJet
   692	                         II or with a specific feature like the LaserJet
   693	                         IIIDSi.
   694	             Math coprocessor
   695	                         An IBM PC or compatible computer with an installed
   696	                         math coprocessor unit.  Commonly referred to as an
   697	                         "80x87 chip," these include the 8087, 80287, and
   698	                         80387 coprocessors.  (80486- and Pentium-based
   699	                         computers have math coprocessors by default.)
   700	                         Most 8086-, 80286-, and 80386-based IBM PCs &
   701	                         compatibles have no installed math coprocessor by
   702	                         default.  (80286- and 80386-based computers can
   703	                         accept a math coprocessor if you purchase one.)
   704	             Modem       A modem.  Almost all programs work with a "Hayes
   705	                         compatible" modem, specifically one able to
   706	                         recognize the Hayes command set (an industry
   707	                         standard).  A few programs claim to work with non-
   708	                         Hayes modems too.  Some programs may require the
   709	                         modem to operate at a specific rate of speed (e.g.
   710	                         "1200 baud").
   711	             Mouse       A Logitec- or Microsoft-compatible mouse.

   718	                         Program descriptions will normally specify the
   719	                         different types of LAN systems under which they
   720	                         can operate.
   721	             Plotter     A plotter output device.  Many of the described
   722	                         programs need a plotter able to recognize the HPGL
   723	                         (Hewlett Packard Graphics Language) command set.
   724	             PostScript printer
   725	                         A printer able to interpret the PostScriptr
   726	                         command set.  Many printers (including the HP
   727	                         LaserJet series) offer PostScript compatibility
   728	                         via plug-in cartridges.  Software also exists to
   729	                         emulate PostScript on hundreds of popular
   730	                         printers.
   731	             SVGA monitor
   732	                         A video monitor capable of displaying SVGA
   733	                         graphics.  This almost always includes higher-
   734	                         resolution monitors.  CGA, EGA, VGA, and Hercules
   735	                         monitors won't suffice.
   736	             Streaming tape device
   737	                         A device capable of reading streaming tapes.  Also
   738	                         referred to as a "tape backup device."  Streaming
   739	                         tapes look something like a standard music
   740	                         cassette or videocassette, but it holds
   741	                         information only a computer can read.  Common
   742	                         streaming tapes include DC600, DC2000, DC2120;
   743	                         tape storage formats include QIC-40 and QIC-80.
   744	             VGA monitor A video monitor capable of displaying VGA
   745	                         graphics.  This almost always includes higher-

   751	                         memory (see above).  Windows, OS/2, and newer
   752	                         versions of DOS come with software designed to
   753	                         implement XMS memory on computers with enough
   754	                         installed memory.

   757	          1.2  Registration benefits
   758	
   759	          All ASP member shareware products come with certain minimum
   760	          benefits when you register.  The author must acknowledge your
   761	          registration (you don't just get a canceled check) and must
   762	          provide a minimum amount of technical support for at least three
   763	          months.
   764	
   765	          Many authors provide other registration benefits such as a
   766	          printed manual, a master disk, a year of unlimited phone support,
   767	          source code, etc.  The product description will mention them when
   768	          appropriate.

   773	
   774	          In addition, every ASP member can offer the following benefits to
   775	          registered customers:

   780	                         register an ASP member's shareware product.
   781	
   782	          Many authors include this information when they acknowledge
   783	          registrations.  Contact the author if you need assistance.
   784	
   785	          Some authors add "registration reminder screens" to the shareware
   786	          version of a program as a way to gently remind people to
   787	          register.  (The ASP sets ethical standards regarding it.)  Almost
   788	          all authors will either send a copy of the program without
   789	          reminder screens, or will disclose a method to disable the
   790	          reminders, once you register the product.
   791

   793	          1.3  Sample product description
   794	
   795	          This sample description will help you understand what each field
   796	          means:
   797	
   798	          Product:  Shareware Program Name                            [***]
   799	            A "[***]" across from the product name indicates a new or
   800	            updated description since the last catalog.
   801	          Author:  name & phone number of the person or company offering
   802	            this product.  See Appendix A for detailed information about
   803	            the person or company.
   804	          Version:  version number  (release date)
   805	          Needs:  computer type [IBM PC, IBM 80386, Macintosh, etc.],
   806	            operating system, and version number.  May also describe other
   807	            needed or recommended hardware & software.  See above for more
   808	            details.
   809	          Registration fee:  The cost of a single user license, expressed
   810	            in U.S. currency unless otherwise noted.  Many authors provide
   811	            "multi-tier" registrations, and you may pay a little more or
   812	            less than the amount stated here depending on your situation.
   813	            (You can often save money by "reading the fine print.")  Some
   814	            authors include shipping & handling fees in the prices while
   815	            others don't.  Most authors offer network, site, and corporate
   816	            licenses for a higher fee; please contact the author in
   817	            question for details and price quotes.
   818	          SWREG#: applies only to CompuServe users.  You can register this
   819	            product on CompuServe and have the cost added to your service
   820	            bill.  This method of payment proves especially useful for (1)
   821	            overseas users who don't have a credit card accepted by the
   822	            author; and (2) business customers who find it easier to

   832	            Library, and you can pay for it with your MasterCard, Visa,

   837	            purchase order to PsL, fax it to (713) 524-6398.
   838	          Registration benefits:  Describes the benefits you get for regis-
   839	            tering the software.  All ASP shareware programs come with cer-
   840	            tain minimum benefits (see above for details).
   841	          Look for:  FILENAME.EXT on BBSs (call xxx-xxx-xxxx to download it

   849	          Special instructions:  tells if the author limits product
   850	            distribution to the United States.  In some cases the author or
   851	            company may have signed a contract forbidding worldwide share-
   852	            ware distribution.  In other cases the product may only appeal
   853	            to an American audience (income tax software for example).  In
   854	            rare cases, U.S. federal laws may actually prohibit the author
   855	            or company from distributing the product in other countries.
   856	          Editor's note:  the catalog editor may append text of his own if
   857	            something needs further explanation.
   858	          Description:  a paragraph or two of text which describes the
   859	            shareware product in detail.  This information comes direct
   860	            from the author or company behind the program.

  2882	            Typically an empty directory takes up 2048 or 4096 bytes of

 11434	            A virus detection system that protects your computer from virus
 11435	            attack by alerting you to unexpected changes in your executable
 11436	            files or boot record.  Unlike other CRC-based utilities, this
 11437	            uses a sophisticated message digest algorithm that cannot be
 11438	            inverted. FileSafe can detect any changes no matter how well
 11439	            covered. FileSafe is easy to use, unobtrusive, takes up little
 11440	            space and comes with a comprehensive users manual that
 11441	            discusses viruses and strategies for using FileSafe.

 13506	            Helps improve your writing style in two ways. First, it
 13507	            examines your writing for common problems, such as redundant
 13508	            words, wordy phrases, and awkward sentence structure. Second,
 13509	            it analyzes your writing style and presents statistics that
 13510	            tell you where your writing is weak and where it is strong.
 13511	            Although it is not a substitute for an independent review, it
 13512	            can help you to write more clearly and directly and avoid
 13513	            common writing-style errors.

 31258	            A general purpose satellite tracking package designed to take
 31259	            the complexity and confusion out of finding where any earth
 31260	            orbiting satellites (weather, amateur radio, military, foreign,
 31261	            etc.) are in space. It will track up to 8 satellites
 31262	            simultaneously and will provide necessary antenna pointing
 31263	            data.  It provides a colorful, graphical means of visualizing

 36744	          Description:
 36745	            No one really knows when PEG solitaire was invented. Some
 36746	            stories trace it to prisoners during the French Revolution, but
 36747	            published descriptions date at least 100 years earlier.  Most
 36748	            likely the game is even older.  This presents variations on the
 36749	            classic peg solitaire with multiple starting positions, and
 36750	            varying endgames.  One of the pleasures of playing the game on
 36751	            your computer is that you can quickly set up the board to try
 36752	            different strategies. Ages 8 to 88.

 37148	            moves by choosing an initial velocity for one of his pieces,
 37149	            which then follows a trajectory influenced (for a charged

 38098	            The ASP demands professionalism from its members.  Authors must
 38099	            acknowledge every registration (you get more than just a
 38100	            canceled check) and they must provide at least three months of
 38101	            support for their products.  ASP members must also live up to
 38102	            any other benefits they offer.
 38103	
 38104	            You can turn to an ombudsman for help if you can't resolve a
 38105	            problem with an ASP author or disk vendor.  Members must
 38106	            explain this in every shareware program & disk vendor catalog.
 38107	
 38108	            Few people need the ombudsman's help.  ASP members represent
 38109	            the cream of the crop in the shareware industry, but it's nice
 38110	            to know you can turn to someone if you think you got a raw
 38111	            deal.  Unfortunately, it happens - authors have been kicked out
 38112	            because of repeated complaints.
 38113	
 38114	            The Association monitors Congress for potentially damaging
 38115	            legislation and has sent spokesmen to testify before
 38116	            congressional subcommittees.  It has also taken on the respon-
 38117	            sibility of safeguarding the term 'shareware' itself.  ASP has
 38118	            filed motions in countries as far away as England and South
 38119	            Africa to stop people who attempt to claim it as a trademark
 38120	            word.
 38121	
 38122	            ASP members 'meet' online in a public forum of the CompuServe
 38123	            network (GO SHAREWARE).  Members send & receive messages,
 38124	            transmit files, and exchange valuable information.  Old hands
 38125	            in the shareware business pass along their insights to new
 38126	            members.  The group holds public and private debates and
 38127	            members vote on major issues by sending private messages to the
 38128	            Association secretary.
 38129	
 38130	            The ASP holds yearly 'face to face' meetings and appears at
 38131	            various trade shows around the country (including COMDEX and
 38132	            PC-EXPO).  It also provides speakers who lecture on every
 38133	            aspect of shareware.  You can learn more by writing to the
 38134	            Association of Shareware Professionals, 545 Grover Road,

 45035	
 45036	            This appendix lists shareware products now "retired" by the
 45037	            author.  Retired products no longer receive the minimum levels
 45038	            of support, and the authors have agreed to return any registra-
 45039	            tion fees sent in for the software.
 45040	
 45041	            An author may retire a shareware product for any number of
 45042	            reasons.  Some applications have outlived their usefulness;
 45043	            others may have grown too costly to continue supporting due to
 45044	            competition from other authors.

 45228	            Hint: look in the index for the program (by name) if you want
