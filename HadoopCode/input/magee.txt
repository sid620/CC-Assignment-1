     1	MAGEE Enterprises, Inc. announced plans today to significantly enhance
     2	Network H.Q., its software utility designed to survey LAN workstation
     3	configuration information. The company plans to release the Version 2.0
     4	enhancement by March 31,1992, and will showcase the software at
     5	NetWorld/Boston, February 11-13,1992.
     6	
     7	Previous versions of Network H.Q. have been Novell NetWare specific, but
     8	version 2.0 will operate on NetWare, Microsoft LAN Manager, Banyan VINES
     9	and Hayes LAN/Step' NOS. It will also offer an optional DOS or Windows
    10	interface.
    11	
    12	In addition to the list of hardware components currently tracked, the new
    13	version will include such information as a more detailed identification of
    14	PC model numbers, CPU clock speed, EGA/VGA vendor and chipset information.
    15	It will report workstation environments such as Windows or Desqview', ROM
    16	BIOS manufacturer and version, NETBIOS version and Bus type. Network H.Q.
    17	2.0 will also track Macintosh' machines connected to the network, a
    18	frequent request from current installed base users.
    19	
    20	In addition to expanded hardware inventory, Network H.Q. 2.0 will survey
    21	installed software both on the server and workstation drives. An extensive
    22	database of packages will be tracked, and custom, site-specific software
    23	programs may be added to the inventory database. Unlike other software
    24	inventory packages, Network H.Q. 2.0 does not rely solely on published
    25	databases such as the commonly used Software Publisher Association's
    26	database. Instead, MAGEE has custom developed an identification scheme
    27	that will interrogate several items in a program's directory before making
    28	positive identification. MAGEE feels this is imperative to ensure
    29	accuracy.
    30	
    31	The software inventory module included in Network H.Q. 2.0 may be run at
    32	the administrator's discretion, or scheduled to run at specific times. The
    33	ability to schedule software inventories enables the network administrator
    34	to prevent annoying delays in user logins.
    35	
    36	Other notable enhancements to Network H.Q. 2.0 include the ability for the
    37	network administrator to collect key workstation files like CONFIG.SYS or
    38	WIN.INI for updates and maintenance. An improved Report Utility will allow
    39	Network H.Q. 2.0 report data to be exported in the popular Lotus .WKS and
    40	dBase .DBF formats, and sort records enabling users to view them in any
    41	order. Network H.Q. 2.0 will also allow quick queries into a particular
    42	workstation's configuration file enabling help desk personnel to
    43	trouble-shoot from a central location.
    44	
    45	MAGEE's Network H.Q. 2.0 licensing policy, as well as pricing, is designed
    46	to appeal to owners of small, medium, and large networks. Version 2.0 will
    47	be licensed in two ways; per server (unlimited users) and a 100 (limited)
    48	workstation package. The per server license, at $595 suggested retail
    49	allows an unlimited number of workstations to be tracked. This license
    50	acknowledges the prevalence of log-in servers often routing several
    51	hundred users through a single server at varying times. The Network H.Q.
    52	pack retails for $395 and imposes a maximum of 100 unique workstations to
    53	be surveyed by the product. This license is designed for smaller,
    54	departmental client-server and peer-to-peer networks. Users of previous
    55	versions of Network H.Q. will be offered the version 2.0 upgrade for a
    56	reasonable fee.
    57	
    58	MAGEE Enterprises, Inc. is the developer and publisher of Automenu. This
    59	popular DOS menu utility has sold more than one million copies and enjoys
    60	a 22% market-share among "DOS front ends" according to recently published
    61	reports. Its products are distributed worldwide through dealers and VARs.
    62	The company is located at 2909 Langford Road, Suite A600, Norcross,
    63	Georgia 30071-1506; (404) 446-6611; FAX (404) 36
