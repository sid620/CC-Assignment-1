     9	        What follows is an article I wrote for "the Humanist" 
    10	magazine.  I'm posting it here to hopefully spark discussion about 
    11	using Virtual Worlds techniques for extraterrestrial 
    12	exploration.  (Expected publication date - March 1991.)  What do 
    13	you think about the idea?  How should such a mission be designed?

    23	
    24	     Exploration is the hallmark of humanity- the great shaper of 
    25	our history,  the great motivater of our kind.  I don't have to 
    26	imagine the excitement most Spaniards felt when Columbus 
    27	returned with a cargo hold full of exotic treasures from the New 
    28	World.  Although I was only nine, I remember vividly the awesome 
    29	exhilaration I felt while staring into a black and white picture 
    30	tube and watching as Neil Armstrong took control from a 
    31	faltering guidance computer and coolly landed the Eagle on the 
    32	surface of a new world.  Perhaps the noblest thing about our 
    33	species, the most uniquely "human" quality of our experience, is 
    34	the purity of our lusts; for life, for knowledge, and for challenges 
    35	that force us to go beyond ourselves. We thrive on- we need great 
    36	adventures. 
    37	     But since our technology opened up the frontier of space, 
    38	adventures in the grand tradition have been harder to get off the 
    39	ground; sadly, there have been damn few since NASA's finest hour.
    40	     Recently there has been a push to make a mission to Mars 
    41	humankind's next great voyage.  This effort has gained the 
    42	administration's favor.President Bush has personally called for 
    43	the creation of a manned Mars program.  However, Congress has 
    44	been skeptical of, if not hostile to, the plan.  NASA's sterling 
    45	image, so magnificently polished in the Apollo days, has been 
    46	tarnished by the Challenger disaster, the Hubble Telescope 
    47	debacle,and a crippling sequence of design errors uncovered in 
    48	the plans of the proposed space station.  This combined with the 
    49	attached $500 billion price tag has made Congress reluctant to 
    50	loosen the nation's purse strings for putting people on Mars. 
    51	     However, despite NASA's (I hope) transitory incompetence and 
    52	Congress's typical recalcitrance, I believe that Mars looms too 
    53	big in our imaginations for the human odyssey not to draw us 
    54	there.  It is the next logical great space adventure.  The question 
    55	then is not so much when are we going, but how should such a 
    56	mission be designed to best serve humanity?
    57	     Many space advocates assert that a Mars mission should be 
    58	manned and give noble reasons for why we should commit the 
    59	lives of an international crew to the two to four year journey.  
    60	They argue that the huge international collaboration of talented 
    61	technologists needed to land 30 folks on Mars for 40 days (the 
    62	typical scenario) would help bring the world together, open 
    63	vistas of multinational cooperation and foster transcultural 
    64	understanding.  Further,they hope that seeing Soviets and 
    65	Americans working glove in glove on Mars would so inflate the 
    66	world with the spirit of cooperation that it would never again 
    67	flatten into war.  
    68	     Other exploration enthusiasts prefer sending robots in lieu of 
    69	people.  They believe the political benefits of a manned mission 
    70	have been oversold and point out that any mission would itself be 
    71	only a symbol.  Real political progress, they argue, must be made 
    72	on the ground by international cooperation.  However, such 
    73	cooperation could head-up either a human or mechanized mission 
    74	equally well.  Further, they maintain that robot reconnaissance of 
    75	Mars is a better option because it's much cheaper and far safer 
    76	than sending people. 
    77	     Indeed, robots could explore Mars for far less money because 
    78	they don't need any of the myriad of environmental supports we 
    79	require to sustain our biological frailties.  Most of the money for 
    80	a human mission would go just into keeping the astronauts alive.  
    81	Every dollar so spent would be a dollar not used on science, every 
    82	kilogram of payload so dedicated would be a kilogram taken from 
    83	sophisticated instruments of exploration.  In short, astronauts 
    84	would only get in the way of the science- we would learn more 
    85	for a lot less money without them. 
    86	     A robot mission would safeguard more than just astronauts.  
    87	After all,if a Mars bound robot "bought it" the nation would cross 
    88	its arms and cock a collective eyebrow at NASA.  But if people 
    89	died in space the whole Mars program would likely die with them.  
    90	And this, I fear, would be a very real possibility.  Despite 
    91	extensive ground maintenance between each flight, the multi-
    92	billion dollar space shuttles routinely break down in orbit- 
    93	toilets clog, cooling vents fail, computers burn out. . .  In a 
    94	mission lasting just a week or so, and which can be aborted with 
    95	a few hours notice, these failures are merely annoying.  However, 
    96	a series of uncorrectable annoyances appearing throughout a two 
    97	to four year voyage, which cannot be aborted and from which 
    98	there is no hope of rescue, could well cascade into a fatal 
    99	catastrophe before the astronauts could get home.  Also, the 
   100	fragments of Challenger now littering the ocean floor don't 
   101	exactly inspire confidence in NASA's talents in safety 
   102	engineering either.  
   103	     However, there is one crucial place where astronauts totally 
   104	outshine their mechanical competition- public thrills.  Even if 
   105	our robot alternates were as cute as R2-D2 they just wouldn't 
   106	have the same public appeal as an international gaggle of scruffy 
   107	space-suited ruffians toasting marshmallows on the Martian 
   108	outback.  And let's face it, while every epic voyage throughout 
   109	history has been justified with copious platitudes about the 
   110	innate nobility of the human spirit that's not why they happened.  
   111	Adventures have never been primarily moral- they have been 
   112	sensual!  The discovery, the achievement, mastering the 
   113	unexpected, risking and winning- these are the psychological 
   114	primers of the experience, but it is the thrill we seek.  To put it 
   115	crassly,we are willing to spend billions to indulge in a few 
   116	rounds of orgiastic self congratulatory backslapping.  If going to 
   117	the Moon didn't make people feel good we never would have done 
   118	it.  Indeed, history shows that the greatness of any "great 
   119	adventure" is set by how deeply and completely it thrills the 
   120	masses who bankrolled the damn thing, and that the money keeps 
   121	coming only so long as people get their dollar's worth of 
   122	excitement.  
   123	     Therefore, the ideal mission would blend the thrill of human 
   124	exploration with the safety and cost effectiveness of robot 
   125	surrogates. Impossible?  Not anymore.  In fact, I believe that now 
   126	maturing technologies make it inevitable.
   127	     Suppose we begin our Martian adventure by deploying a few 
   128	satellites to take high resolution pictures of the entire surface 
   129	of Mars.  The second  part begins when a mother craft carrying a 
   130	brood of sophisticated robot explorers is launched.  Upon arrival, 
   131	the mother settles into orbit and, as ordered from the earth, 
   132	dispatches her children to perform many missions each featuring 
   133	the landing of a laboratory craft and several reconnaissance  
   134	vehicles at some particularly interesting place.  The laboratory's 
   135	computer controls the collection and analysis of its rovers' booty 
   136	and transmits the results to the mother ship which in turn relays 
   137	it to a gang of a hand wringing gray-beardsback on earth.  
   138	     So far it sounds just like a robot mission, right?  Here's the 
   139	new idea.Even though people would have never physically been 
   140	there, the sites for robot exploration would have been chosen by 
   141	direct human exploration of Mars!
   142	     Here's how.  Imagine you've completed one week of training in 
   143	geology and planet morphology at NASA.  You're not an astronaut, 
   144	just an intelligent someone with a compulsion for adventure. 
   145	You've have been assigned  to explore sector 15A027PC- about a 
   146	thousand square miles of Mars.  You strap yourself into a 
   147	remarkable vehicle and take a breath as you push the button 
   148	marked"Launch Sequence Initializer".  The belly of the mother 
   149	craft opens up and you see Mars beneath you for the first time.  
   150	Your rockets kick in, thrusting you back into your chair as you 
   151	descend rapidly.  Your position appears on the overhead monitor 
   152	as your approach vector hones you in on your assigned area. Once 
   153	there, you float 500 meters above the surface buzzing over 
   154	breathtaking terrain never before seen. Your mind and your 
   155	sensual experience glides above Mars, yet your body is actually 
   156	still on earth.  You are flying a simulator and exploring a 
   157	computer generated "virtual world" that blends those high 
   158	resolution satellite photos into moving 3-D images and is 
   159	therefore identical in every detail to the real Martian surface.  
   160	You look out of your port window to see Phobos, Mars' largest 
   161	moon, just peeking over the horizon.  You hear the Martian wind 
   162	blowing over your cockpit.  You feel your craft move, bank and 
   163	roll as you change course and speed.  You see an ancient and now 
   164	barren river bed cutting through the valley below you.  To your 
   165	left you spot a fascinating possibility. There, about 1000 meters 
   166	away, is a large rocky overhang which completely shields part of 
   167	the river bed from the sun.  Could some ancient form of life have 
   168	once clung to those rocks when the river coursed though this 
   169	valley?  Could that overhang have protected the evidence of that 
   170	life until now?  You log your discovery and fly on.  Later, NASA 
   171	scientists will confirm it and send their intrepid robots to 
   172	investigate. This Virtual World technology exist to impressive 
   173	extent already. The Mars simulator I'm postulating is likely only a 
   174	few years away.
   175	     Human exploration of a virtual Mars has important advantages 
   176	over human exploration of the real one.  Yes, it's safer and much 
   177	less costly, but it's also a much more efficient.  By breaking up 
   178	the surface into a thousands of pieces the whole of Mars could be 
   179	searched by an army of volunteer explorers at our leisure.  
   180	Important sites could be carefully selected and scrutinized, 
   181	instead of having to do everything with 30 over worked space-
   182	suited explorers in only 40 days.  
   183	     But what's most important about all this is how it opens 
   184	extraterrestrial exploration to all of us, and that is very 
   185	exciting!  You won't have to be physically perfect with a lifetime 
   186	of dedicated training to explore strange new worlds.  Any 
   187	intelligent person would be able to do it. When teenagers and 
   188	grandparents, waitresses and executives, the poor, the 
   189	handicapped and the advantaged can queue up to make original 
   190	discoveries about the earth's red sister the dividends to science 
   191	and society will be incalculable.  When we take space exploration 
   192	out of the theoretical and make it part of peoples lives, let them 
   193	"touch the magic", we will turn kids on to scientific carriers and 
   194	generate a new public enthusiasm for the powers of technology 
   195	which will benefit humanity far into the future.  How naive, 
   196	wasteful and even useless it seems to send a few people to Mars 
   197	when we can in a real way bring the entire planet home to 
   198	everyone.
   199	     Let's liberate ourselves from the medieval notions of chivalry 
   200	that have guided our explorations for a thousand years.  
   201	Exploration, the experience of some new place, no longer requires 
   202	the explorer to physically travel there.  It's time to bring our 
   203	fantastic technological prowess to bear on opening up the cosmos 
   204	to all of us, to turn kids on to science as never before possible 
   205	and instill in humanity a sense of the true majesty of space 
   206	exploration.  
   207	     So keep your fingers crossed and your flight suit pressed.  The 
   208	next "new world" adventures just might be waiting for you.
