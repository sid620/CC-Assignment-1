    10	"Cyberspace.  A consensual hallucination experienced daily 
    11	by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation...A 
    12	graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of 
    13	every computer in the human system.  Unthinkable 
    14	complexity.  Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the 
    15	mind, clusters and constellations of data.  Like city lights, 
    16	receding..."
    17				--William Gibson, Neuromancer
    18	
    19	Suddenly I don't have a body anymore.  
    20	
    21	All that remains of the aging shambles which usually constitutes my 
    22	corporeal self  is a glowing, golden hand floating before me like 
    23	Macbeth's dagger.  I point my finger and drift down its length to the 
    24	bookshelf on the office wall.
    25	
    26	I try to grab a book but my hand passes through it.  
    27	
    28	"Make a fist inside the book and you'll have it," says my invisible 
    29	guide.  
    30	
    31	I do, and when I move my hand again, the book remains embedded in 
    32	it.  I open my hand and withdraw it.  The book remains suspended 
    33	above the shelf.
    34	
    35	I look up.  Above me I can see the framework of red girders which 
    36	supports the walls of the office...above them the blue-blackness of 
    37	space.  The office has no ceiling, but it hardly needs one.  There's never 
    38	any weather here.  
    39	
    40	I point up and begin my ascent, passing right through one of the 
    41	overhead beams on my way up.  Several hundred feet above the office, 
    42	I look down.  It sits in the middle of a little island in space.   I 
    43	remember the home asteroid of The Little Prince with its one volcano, 
    44	it's one plant.
    45	
    46	How very like the future this place might be: a tiny world just big 
    47	enough to support the cubicle of one Knowledge Worker.  I feel a wave 
    48	of loneliness and head back down.  But I'm going too fast.  I plunge 
    49	right on through the office floor and into the bottomless indigo below.  
    50	Suddenly I can't remember how to stop and turn around.  Do I point 
    51	behind myself?  Do I have to turn around before I can point?  I flip into 
    52	brain fugue.
    53	
    54	"Just relax," says my guide in her cool clinical voice.  "Point straight 
    55	up and open your hand when you get where you want to be."
    56	
    57	Sure.  But how can you get where you want to be when you're coming 
    58	from nowhere at all?  
    59	
    60	And I don't seem to have a location exactly.  In this pulsating new 
    61	landscape, I've been reduced to a point of view.  The whole subject of  
    62	"me" yawns into a chasm of interesting questions.  It's like Disneyland 
    63	for epistomologists.  "If a virtual tree falls in the computer-generated 
    64	forest..?"  Or "How many cybernauts can dance on the head of a 
    65	shaded solid?"  Gregory Bateson would have loved this.  Wittgenstein, 
    66	phone home. 
    67	
    68	At least I know where I left my body.  It's in a room called Cyberia in a 
    69	building called Autodesk in a town called Sausalito, California.  Planet 
    70	Earth.  Milky Way.  So on and so forth.  My body is cradled in its usual 
    71	cozy node of space-time vectors.
    72	
    73	But I...or "I"...am in cyberspace, a universe churned up from computer 
    74	code by a Compaq 386 and a pair of Matrox graphics boards, then fed 
    75	into my rods and cones by  VPL Eyephones, a set of goggles through 
    76	whose twin, parallax-corrected video screens I see this new world.  
    77	
    78	When I move my head, the motion is tracked by a a Polhemus 
    79	magnetic sensor and the imaging engine of cyberspace is instructed to 
    80	alter what I see accordingly.  Thus, having made a controlled ascent 
    81	back up through the floor of the "office," I turn to the left and I see red 
    82	chair with a desk behind it.  I turn to the right and I see a door leading 
    83	out onto the floating platform.  
    84	
    85	The configuration and position of my right hand is fed into the system 
    86	by a VPL DataGlove, also with an Polhemus attached to it.  The 
    87	relationship between my hand and the eyephones is precisely 
    88	measured by the two trackers so that my hand appears where I would 
    89	expect it to.  When I point or make a fist, the fiber optics sewn into the 
    90	DataGlove convert kinesthetics into electronics.  For a decisecond or so, 
    91	my hand disappears and then reappears, glowing and toon-like, in the 
    92	appropriate shape.
    93	
    94	Despite the current confines of my little office-island, I know that I 
    95	have become a traveller in a realm which will be ultimately bounded 
    96	only by human imagination, a world without any of the usual limits of 
    97	geography, growth, carrying capacity, density or ownership.  In this 
    98	magic theater, there's no gravity, no Second Law of Thermodynamics, 
    99	indeed, no laws at all beyond those imposed by computer processing 
   100	speed...and given the accelerating capacity of that constraint, this 
   101	universe will probably expand faster than the one I'm used to.
   102	
   103	Welcome to Virtual Reality.  We've leapt through the looking glass.  
   104	Now what?  Go ask Alice.
   105	
   106	
   107	      
   108	
   109	
   110	The Next Big Thing
   111	Money from Nuthin'
   112	
   113	"I think this is the biggest thing since we landed on the Moon," says 
   114	Jaron Lanier, the dread-locked CEO of VPL Research.  (Who was 9 
   115	years old at that time.)  I don't choke on that one.  Indeed, I'd take it a 
   116	bit farther, guessing that Columbus was probably the last person to 
   117	behold so much usable and unclaimed real estate (or unreal estate) as 
   118	these cybernauts have discovered.
   119	
   120	At Autodesk, the Sausalito publisher of AutoCAD drafting software, 
   121	they spent the summer of T89 in product development heaven, talking 
   122	telephone, automobile, airplane, computer.  They invoked Edison, Bell, 
   123	Ford, and Jobs.  And there was that loincloth-and-machete sense of 
   124	enterprise which one might have experienced in the Wright Brothers' 
   125	Akron Bicycle Shop or Paul Jobs' garage in Mountain View...as well as 
   126	countless less-chronicled shots at perpetual motion or baldness cures.
   127	
   128	Neil Armstrong's small step ran about 70 Billion Real Dollars, but 
   129	when John Walker, the Hacker King of Autodesk, committed his 
   130	company to creating the first commercially-available "world in a can," 
   131	he figured that the prototype "gizmo" could be built for about $25,000.     
   132	
   133	VPL, the other trading post on VR frontier, isn't much fatter, although 
   134	internal synergy seems to magnify output.  Since their incorporation in 
   135	1985, they've had two Scientific American covers and produced the 
   136	DataGlove, DataSuit, the PowerGlove, Swivel 3-D and VPL 
   137	EyePhones, the only commercially available head-mounted display.  
   138	They've been in a couple of big lawsuits (one, just concluded to their 
   139	satisfaction, with Stanford University), and create, at a distance, the 
   140	mirage of a fair-sized company going at it pretty hard.  
   141	
   142	But up close, one can get on a first-name basis with every VPL 
   143	employee in the course of an afternoon. They have yet to outgrow the 
   144	third floor of their slightly tacky building at the Redwood City yacht 
   145	harbor.
   146	
   147	While Apple's research gazillions yield such dubious fruit as 
   148	multimedia and the AppleFax Modem, while IBM replicates methods 
   149	for chaining bureaucrats to its mainframes,  it begins to appear that the 
   150	Next Big Thing will begin its commercial evolution as humbly as the 
   151	personal computer.
   152	
   153	As usual, the Big Guys have neither the means nor the desire to engage 
   154	in such open-ended creation as settling the virtual universe will 
   155	require.  Like the Union Pacific Railroad awaiting the fact of empire, 
   156	they prefer to let the rag-tag pioneers die all over the frontier before 
   157	they come out to claim it.  
   158	
   159	When the Altairs and Osbornes of Virtual Reality have made their fatal 
   160	errors are headed for Chapter 11, IBM probably will issue forth the 
   161	SolutionStation VR Network or some such and accelerate natural 
   162	selection in the field.
   163	
   164	But as I write this, VPL and Autodesk still have  it to themselves.  
   165	Actually, they are not the first to make virtual landfall. They are only 
   166	the first at financial risk. Unlike the first automobiles or telephones 
   167	their commercial fledglings had the advantage of long incubation by 
   168	government and Academia.
   169	
   170	Virtual Reality, as a concept, found first form at the University of Utah 
   171	over twenty years ago in the fecund cranium of Ivan E. Sutherland, the 
   172	godfather of computer graphics and the originator of about every  Big 
   173	Computer Idea not originated by Alan Kay or Doug Englebart.  In 
   174	1968, he produced the first head-mounted display.  This was the 
   175	critical element in VR hardware, but it was so heavy that it had to be 
   176	suspended from the ceiling...at some peril to its wearer.  Damocles was 
   177	mentioned.
   178	
   179	Besides, once you got it on, there wasn't much to see in there.  There 
   180	wasn't a computer in existence which could churn out enough 
   181	polygons per second to simulate a reality much more full-bodied than 
   182	a game of Pong. 
   183	
   184	So Virtual Reality passed a generation waiting for the equipment to 
   185	arrive.  In 1985 the Japanese finally (and unintentionally) provided us 
   186	with the right video displays when NASA's Mike McGreevy happened 
   187	to notice that the Citizen Watch Co. LCD displays in a Radio Shack 
   188	mini-TV were small enough to fit two in a head-mounted.  
   189	
   190	I hardly need to detail what happened to CPU horsepower during that 
   191	period.  By 1985, graphics engines of appropriate juice were almost 
   192	within financial range of entities not involved in the defense of our 
   193	nation.
   194	
   195	Also by this time, NASA had made a strong commitment to VR 
   196	research, though mostly in the service of "telepresence," the ability to 
   197	project one's judgement and actions into a robot located some real 
   198	place you'd rather not be, like space.  They were less persuaded by the 
   199	attractions of unreal places.
   200	
   201	The Air Force was also conducting research at Wright-Patterson under 
   202	the direction of Tom Furness, but most of this was directed at the usual 
   203	dismal purpose, simplifying the annihilation of non-virtual humans.  
   204	Heads up displays and looks that kill were their speciality.
   205	
   206	For all this expenditure of tax dollars, Virtual Reality still lacked two 
   207	critical elements: a sense of whimsy and a fluid, three-dimensional 
   208	method for "grabbing" and manipulating the furniture of cyberspace.  
   209	VPL was on the case.  
   210	
   211	VPL's Tom Zimmerman had always wanted the ability to actually play 
   212	air guitar.  It was the sort of desire his "boss," Jaron Lanier, could 
   213	understand. Jaron had only gotten into computers after concluding 
   214	that musical composition was not a reliable day job.  And his 
   215	ownership of more than 300 musical instruments might indicate, if 
   216	nothing else, a probing dissatisfaction with the limits of each one.  
   217	
   218	Over a two year period, Zimmerman and Young Harvill (also of VPL) 
   219	created the DataGlove, a hand with which to strum those invisible 
   220	strings.  While they were creating this hardware interface (though the 
   221	Spandex feel of the DataGlove makes "leisureware interface" seem like 
   222	a more appropriate term), Jaron and Chuck Blanchard were writing 
   223	Body Electric, the software necessary to map the actual movements of 
   224	the DataGlove and eyephones onto the virtual landscape.
   225	
   226	The commercial colonization of cyberspace was beginning.  VPL's 
   227	strategy was to build the most powerful simulations current 
   228	technology would allow, without regard to hardware cost, selling the 
   229	spin-offs at increasingly affordable prices.  Once such item, the 
   230	PowerGlove, is a Nintendo game controller based on the DataGlove 
   231	which VPL has licensed to Mattel.  (Available this Christmas at a store 
   232	near you for $85.00.)  
   233	
   234	Another VPL spin-off product is Swivel 3-D, odds on the best 3-D 
   235	modeler for the Macintosh.  Young Harvill wrote it as a tool to create 
   236	an artificial reality quickly and easily on Mac before integrating it into 
   237	Body Electric and sending it over the twin Silicon Graphics CPUs 
   238	which blow it up to full size.       
   239	
   240	In September of 1988, John Walker wrote an internal Autodesk white 
   241	paper called Through the Looking Glass: Beyond "User Interfaces."   In it 
   242	he proposed an "Autodesk Cyberpunk Initiative" to produce within 16 
   243	months a doorway into cyberspace...available to anyone with $15,000 
   244	and a 386 computer.  The project's motto:  "Reality Isn't Enough Any 
   245	More."  (I wondered if they considered: "I'd rather have a computer in 
   246	front of me than a frontal lobotomy...")
   247	
   248	Since NASA's Virtual Realities were running in the millions and VPL's 
   249	in the middle hundreds of thousands, Walker envisioned a significant 
   250	discount over previous models, but he knew that his customers, if any, 
   251	would be more bargain-conscious than, say, the U.S. Air Force.  
   252	
   253	Autodesk's Cyberia Project was running hard by Christmas, 1988, 
   254	staffed by William and Meredith Bricken, Eric Gullichsen, Pat Gelband, 
   255	Eric Lyons, Gary Wells, Randy Walser, and John Lynch.  When I 
   256	arrived on the scene in May, they had been keeping hacker's hours for 
   257	a long time.        
   258	
   259	And they were ready to make a product.  They'd made a promo video 
   260	starring Timothy Leary.  Gullichsen had even registered William 
   261	Gibson's term "cyberspace"  as an Autodesk trademark, prompting an 
   262	irritated Gibson to apply for trademark registration of the term "Eric 
   263	Gullichsen."  By June, they had an implementation which, though 
   264	clearly the Kitty Hawk version of the technology, endowed people 
   265	with an instantaneous vision of the Concorde level.  
   266	
   267	Meanwhile, back in the real world, things were getting complicated.  
   268	While everyone who went to Autodesk's Cyberia agreed that Virtual 
   269	Reality was something, there was less agreement as to what.  
   270	
   271	Part of the problem was the scale of possibilities it invoked.  They 
   272	seemed to be endless and yet none of them was anywhere near ready 
   273	to return an investment.  But when something has endless possibilities, 
   274	each of them is liable to dilute down to a point where people start to 
   275	say things like, "Sure, but what's it really good for."  At which point the 
   276	devoted cybernut might lapse into random syllables, his tongue heavy 
   277	with all that golden potential.  
   278	
   279	Virtual Reality induces a perception of huge potency underlying 
   280	featureless ambiguity.  There is a natural tendency to fill this gap 
   281	between power and definition with ideology.  And the presence of 
   282	such unclaimed vastness seems to elicit territorial impulses from 
   283	psychic regions too old to recognize the true infinity of this new 
   284	frontier.  Disputes appeared like toadstools in the rich new soil of 
   285	cyberspace.
   286	
   287	Thus, by mid-November, the Autodesk half of the Next Big Thing was 
   288	down to one full-time hacker: Randy Walser.  The Brickens had headed 
   289	to Seattle to join Tom Furness in a (non-lethal) VR research program at 
   290	the University of Washington.  Eric Gullichsen and Pat Gelband had 
   291	formed their own VR company, Sense 8.  (Get it?)
   292	
   293	Within, VPL's soulful band remained as tightly bonded as a Hell's 
   294	Angels chapter.  Without, they found themselves increasingly tangled 
   295	in legal hassles.  They were in court with AGE (a group of New York 
   296	toy developers who are not just in it for their health), trying to protect 
   297	their rights to the PowerGlove.  They'd just settled a suit with Stanford 
   298	University.  In general, they were having experiences which made me 
   299	question the axiom that you can't cheat an honest man.           
   300	
   301	Still, everyone realized that a baby this size would be bound to 
   302	occasion some labor pains.  As the general media began to pick up on 
   303	Virtual Reality, its midwives were preparing themselves for interesting 
   304	times.  It would be worth it.  But why?
   305	
   306	To the people who will actually make the future, such a question is 
   307	beside the point.  They will develop cyberspace because, like Mallory's 
   308	mountain, it's there.  Sort of.
   309	
   310	
   311	      
   312	
   313	
   314	There some practical reasons for the settlement of cyberspace.  They 
   315	aren't as much fun to think about as the impractical ones, but they 
   316	exist.  First among them is that this is the next logical step in the quest 
   317	to eliminate the interface...the mind-machine information barrier.
   318	
   319	Over the last twenty years, our relations with these magic boxes have 
   320	become intimate at a rate matched only by the accelerating speed of 
   321	their processors.  From the brutal austerity of batch-processed punch-
   322	cards to the snuggly Macintosh, the interface has become far less 
   323	cryptic and far more interactive.  
   324	
   325	There have remained some apparently unbreachable barriers between 
   326	us and the CPU.  One of them was the keyboard, which even with the 
   327	graphical interface and the accompanying infestation of mice, 
   328	remained the principal thoroughfare from human perception to RAM.  
   329	The thin alphanumeric stream which drips from our fingertips and 
   330	into the computer is a pale reflection of the thoughts which produce it, 
   331	arriving before the CPU at a pace absurdly mis-matched to its 
   332	chewing/spitting capacities.
   333	
   334	Then there is the screen itself.  While a vast improvement on the 
   335	flickering LED's of the Altair or even the amber text of DOS, the 
   336	metaphorical desktop remains flat as paper.  There is none of the depth 
   337	or actual spatiality of experience.
   338	
   339	After we get past what few documents we can keep on the screen at 
   340	one time, we are back to the alphabetized hierarchy.  We can't pile it, 
   341	as most of us tend to do in real life.  We have to file it.  And this is not
   342	
   343	the way the mind stores information.  One doesn't remember the 
   344	names of his friends alphabetically.  When looking for a phase in a 
   345	book, you are more likely to look for its spatial position on the page 
   346	than it's intellectual position in context.
   347	
   348	The actual operation of human memory works on a model more like 
   349	the one Saint Thomas Aquinas used.  Aquinas, who carried around in 
   350	his head almost all the established knowledge of his simpler world, is 
   351	said to have imagined a mind-castle with many different rooms in 
   352	which varying kinds of ideas dwelled.  The floor plan increased with 
   353	his knowledge.       
   354	
   355	Nicholas Negroponte recreated a modest version of Aquinas' castle in 
   356	the 70's.  He came up with a virtual office, represented in cartoon form 
   357	on the screen.  One could mouse around to the "piles" of  "paper" 
   358	stacked on the "desk" or "filing cabinet," leafing through them not by 
   359	the first letter of their subject name but by their archaeological layer of 
   360	deposition.  
   361	
   362	The problem was the screen.  Negroponte created a flat picture of an 
   363	office rather than something more like the real thing because that was 
   364	all one could display on a screen.  In two dimensions, the image of 
   365	desktop seemed a lot more natural than the image of the desk.  Thence 
   366	the Macintosh. 
   367	
   368	I used to think that the only way around these narrow I/O apertures 
   369	lay in such heroic solutions as brain implants.  I think I was about 14 
   370	when it occurred to me that this was the answer.  Brain surgery 
   371	seemed a minor nuisance if it left one with the ability to remember 
   372	everything.  
   373	
   374	I suppose I'd still be willing to put a Cray in my cranium, but my faith 
   375	in technology has moderated since early adolescence.  I'm more 
   376	comfortable with the possibility of an interface which fills the gap 
   377	between keyboarding and neurological hardwiring and involves no 
   378	cortical knife-play.  Virtual Reality is almost certainly that.
   379	
   380	And indeed, Virtual Reality may be so close to the implant side of the 
   381	continuum that, as Randy Walser of Autodesk insists, it's not even 
   382	appropriate to call it an interface.  It more a place...kind of like Fibber 
   383	McGee's Ultimate Closet...than the semi-permeable information 
   384	membrane to which we're accustomed.
   385	
   386	Whatever you want to call it, Autodesk's John Walker puts it this way, 
   387	"If cyberspace truly represents the next generation of human 
   388	interaction with computers, it will represent the most profound change 
   389	since the development of the personal computer."  Right.
   390	
   391	But that still doesn't tell us what it's good for besides extending human 
   392	quirkiness to the storage of immaterial stuff.  After all, most of what 
   393	humans do with computers is merely an improvement over what they 
   394	did with other keyboard-bound devices, whether typewriters or 
   395	calculators.  Word processing and numerical analysis will be no easier 
   396	"inside" the machine than it was outside.   
   397	
   398	But let's quit being giddy for a moment.  We're talking bucks here.  
   399	Right now a good working platform costs almost as much as a CAT 
   400	scanner.  Who's going to buy one without something like Blue Cross 
   401	footing the bill?  And why?
   402	
   403	Alright, there is a reason why Autodesk is involved in this enterprise 
   404	besides some daydream of the Ultimate Hack.  Whatever adventures 
   405	they might entertain they afford by selling AutoCAD, the Dbase III of 
   406	architecture.  How many architects have dreamed of the ability to take 
   407	their clients on a walk inside their drawings before their 
   408	miscommunications were sealed in mortar?
   409	
   410	Virtual Reality has already been put to such use at the University of 
   411	North Carolina.  There Sitterman Hall, the new $10 million home of 
   412	UNC's computer science department, was designed by virtual means.
   413	
   414	Using a head-mounted display along with a handlebar-steerable 
   415	treadmill, the building's future users "walked through" it, discovering, 
   416	among other things, a discomforting misplacement of a major interior 
   417	wall in the lobby.  At the point of the discovery, moving the wall out 
   418	was cheap.  A retrofit following the first "real" walk-through would 
   419	have cost more by several orders of magnitude.  Thus, one can imagine 
   420	retrofit savings from other such examples which could start to make 
   421	DataSuits as common a form of architectural apparel as chinos and 
   422	tweed.  
   423	
   424	Given the fact that AutoCAD is already generating about  a hundred 
   425	seventy million dollars a year even without such pricy appurtenances 
   426	as cyberspace design tools, it isn't hard to imagine a scenario in which 
   427	developing workstations for virtual architecture comes to look like 
   428	very shrewd business.
   429	
   430	Then there is the burgeoning scientific market.  Computers are the new 
   431	microscopes.  Increasingly, they allow us to see into worlds which are 
   432	not only too small but too weird to bring to human scale before.   For 
   433	example, they are showing us the infinitely detailed order of chaos, 
   434	never before observable, in a form which makes it possible to 
   435	appreciate its simplicity as well as its complexity.
   436	
   437	Virtual Reality promises the ability to not only see but to "touch" 
   438	forbidden realms.  Again at UNC, work is already quite advanced in 
   439	which one can assemble complex molecules like Tinkertoys, the 
   440	attraction or repulsion between individual atoms in the assembly 
   441	modelled to the scale of human tactile perceptions.  The drug industry 
   442	alone could have uses for such capacity sufficient to sustain a lot of 
   443	CyberBiz.  
   444	
   445	One can imagine a lot of heretofore inaccessible "places" in which 
   446	one's presence might be scientifically illuminating.  A Fantastic Voyage 
   447	through the circulatory system will become possible (with or without 
   448	Raquel Welch).  Or travel to alien worlds.  (Thanks to JPL, I have 
   449	already taken an extremely convincing helicopter ride down the Vallis 
   450	Marinaris on Mars.)
   451	
   452	Then there all the places which have never before had physical 
   453	existence on any scale: the rolling plains of mathematical topologies, 
   454	the humming lattice of quantum states, cloud chambers in which mu 
   455	mesons are the size of basketballs and decay over weeks rather than 
   456	picoseconds.           
   457	
   458	The possibility for less sober uses seems equally fertile.  One can 
   459	imagine VR salons, video game parlors for big kids with Gold Cards, 
   460	in which a central supercomputer provides the opportunity for a score 
   461	of people to be Ms. Pacman.  Or whatever.  Nolan Bushnell, the 
   462	founder of Atari and something of an expert on the subject of video 
   463	games, is already at work on something like this.   
   464	
   465	The list of possibilities is literally bounded only by the imagination.  
   466	Working bodies for the damaged.  Teleconferencing with body 
   467	language.  Virtual surgery.  Hey, this is a practical thing to do!        
   468	
   469	And yet I suspect that something else altogether, something not so 
   470	practical,  is at the root of these yearnings.  Why do we really want to 
   471	develop Virtual Reality?  There seems to be a flavor of longing here 
   472	which I associate with the desire to converse with aliens or dolphins or 
   473	the never-born.  
   474	
   475	On some level, I think we can now see the potential for technology, 
   476	long about the business of making the metaphorical literal, of reversing 
   477	the process and re-infecting ordinary reality with luminous magic.  
   478	
   479	Or maybe this is just another expression of what may be the third 
   480	oldest human urge, the desire of have visions.  Maybe we want to get 
   481	high.

   489	
   490				Jerry Garcia
   491	
   492	Knowing that Garcia is a sucker for anything which might make a 
   493	person question all he knows, I gave him a call not long after my first 
   494	cyberspace demo.  Hell yes, he was interested.  When?  If I'd told him 
   495	6:00 AM, I think he'd have been there on time.
   496	
   497	He adapted to it quicker than anyone I'd watched other than my 4 year 
   498	old daughter Anna (who came home and told her sisters matter-of-
   499	factly that she been to a neat "place" that afternoon.)  
   500	
   501	By the time he crossed back over to our side of Reality Horizon, he was 
   502	pretty kid-like himself.  "Well," he finally said, "they outlawed LSD.  
   503	It'll be interesting to see what they do with this."
   504	
   505	Which brings me to a point which makes Jaron Lanier very 
   506	uncomfortable.  The closest analog to Virtual Reality in my experience 
   507	is psychedelic, and, in fact, cyberspace is already crawling with 
   508	delighted acid heads.
   509	
   510	The reason Jaron resents the comparison is that it is both inflammatory 
   511	(now that all drugs are evil) and misleading.  The Cyberdelic 
   512	Experience isn't like tripping, but it is as challenging to describe to the 
   513	uninitiated and it does force some of the same questions, most of them 
   514	having to do with the fixity of reality itself.  
   515	
   516	While you can hardly expect people to lay down $15,000 for something 
   517	just because it shakes their basic tenets, that's enough to make it worth 
   518	the trip for me.  I think the effort to create convincing artificial
   519	realities will teach us the same humbling lesson about reality which 
   520	artificial intelligence has taught us about intelligence...namely, that we 
   521	don't know a damned thing about it.    
   522	
   523	I've never been of the cut-and-dried school on your Reality Question.  I 
   524	have a feeling VR will further expose the conceit that "reality" is a fact. 
   525	
   526	It will provide another reminder of the seamless continuity between 
   527	the world outside and the world within delivering another major hit to 
   528	the old fraud of objectivity.  RTReal'," as Kevin Kelly put it, "is going 
   529	to be one of the most relative words we'll have." 
   530	
   531	And that's just fine with me, since so much of what's wrong in 
   532	America is based on the pathological need for certainty and the idiotic 
   533	delusion that such a condition can even exist.
   534	
   535	Another reason for relating this to acid is the overwhelming sense of its 
   536	cultural scale.  It carries with it a cosmic titillation I haven't 
   537	experienced since 1966.  There is also the same dense shower of 
   538	synchronicities surrounding it.  (I must have run into William and 
   539	Meredith Bricken ten times, always unexpectedly and sometimes in the 
   540	strangest of places.  Today, as I was typing his name, Jaron called me 
   541	for the first time in three weeks.  Then I felt strangely moved to call 
   542	Eric Gullichson after a couple of months of silence.  He told me that 
   543	yesterday had been his last day at Autodesk.  Etc. Etc. Etc.)  
   544	     
   545	Finally, Timothy Leary is all excited again.  Now I don't endow every 
   546	one of his pronouncements with oracular qualities...I remember the 
   547	Comet Starseed... but I have always thought that Uncle Tim is kind of 
   548	like a reverse of the canary in the coal mine.  Whenever the culture is 
   549	about to make a big move, he's the first canary to start jumping up and 
   550	down.  
   551	
   552	He's also, like Zelig, a kind of Zeitgeist chameleon.  He spent the 40's in 
   553	the Army.  In the 50's, he was a tweedy young college professor, a 
   554	Jules Feiffer cartoon.  In the 60's, he was, well, Timothy Leary.  In the 
   555	70's, he became, along with H. R. Haldeman, a political prisoner.  He 
   556	lived up the material 80's in Beverly Hills.  Whatever America is about 
   557	to do, Tim starts doing it first.  
   558	
   559	When I visited him recently, he was already as cyberpunk as he had 
   560	been psychedelic when I last saw at Millbrook 22 years ago.  Still, his 
   561	current persona seems reasonable, even seraphic.  He calmly scored a 
   562	long list of persuasive points, the most resonant of which is that most 
   563	Americans have been living in Virtual Reality since the proliferation of 
   564	television.  All cyberspace will do is make the experience interactive 
   565	instead of passive. 
   566	
   567	"Our brains are learning how to exhale as well as inhale in the data-
   568	sphere." he said.  Like our finny ancestors crawling up on land, we are 
   569	about to be come amphibians again, equally at home in visceral and 
   570	virtual frames. 
   571	
   572	The latest bus is pulling out of the station.  As usual, Leary has been on 
   573	it for a while, waiting patiently for it to depart.
   574	
   575	      
   576	
   577	Then there is the...uhhhm...sexual thing.  I have been through eight or 
   578	ten Q. & A. sessions on Virtual Reality and I don't remember one 
   579	where sex didn't come up.  As though the best thing about all this will 
   580	be the infinite abundance of shaded polygonal party dolls.  As though 
   581	we are devising here some fabulously expensive form of Accu-jac.  
   582	
   583	This is strange.  I don't what to make of it, since, as things stand right 
   584	now, nothing could be more disembodied or insensate than the 
   585	experience of cyberspace.  It's like having had your everything 
   586	amputated.  You're left mighty under-endowed and any partner 
   587	would be so insubstantial you could walk right through her without 
   588	either of you feeling a thing.  (In fact, when people play tag in Jaron's 
   589	Reality Built for Two, one strategy is to hide inside the other person's 
   590	head.)
   591	
   592	And I did overhear the word "DataCondom" at one point...  Maybe the 
   593	nerds who always ask this question will get a chance to make it with 
   594	their computers at long last.  (I prefer not to think too much of how 
   595	anyone who would want to make it with a machine might treat the 
   596	women in their lives...if any there be.)
   597	
   598	Fortunately, I think these dreams of cybersex will be thwarted by their 
   599	own realization.  Yes, it will work for that purpose and it will be easy.  
   600	But the real point of Virtual Reality, as with life itself, is contact.  
   601	Contact with oneself alone is certainly a laudable enough goal, but the 
   602	presence of half a million dollars worth of equipment between that 
   603	subject and object is neither necessary nor desirable.
   604	
   605	Even if Virtual Reality turns out to provide the format for the ultimate 
   606	pornographic film...a "feelie" with a perfect body...it will serve us 
   607	better as the ultimate telephone.

   614	There was a man who lived in town
   615	And he was wondrous wise.
   616	He jumped into a bramble bush
   617	And scratched out both his eyes.
   618	And when he saw what he had done,
   619	With all his might and main,
   620	He jumped back in the bramble bush
   621	And scratched them in again.

   625	
   626					Jaron Lanier
   627	
   628	Since the Sumerians starting poking sticks into clay and claiming that 
   629	the resulting cuneiform squiggles meant something, we've been living 
   630	in the Information Age.  Only lately did someone come up with a name 
   631	for it.  I suppose that was because we quit making anything else of 
   632	value.  Before that, they just called it civilization.    
   633	
   634	Indeed, one could make a pretty good case that consciousness, as we 
   635	define it, arose simultaneously with the ability to communicate its 
   636	products symbolically.  (See The Origin of Consciousness and the 
   637	Breakdown of the Bicameral Brain by Julian Jaynes for related 
   638	conclusions.)
   639	
   640	The Sumerians had a pretty clear perspective on what this stuff was 
   641	good for.  The preponderance of their runic tablets turn out to be, on 
   642	translation, calendars, inventories, and mnemonic devices for such 
   643	data as one might need to remember but which was too trivial to merit 
   644	conversion into the other storage form of the era, epic poetry.  They 
   645	didn't use it to describe anything.
   646	
   647	Perhaps they recognized that even the most mundane experience 
   648	would beggar any effort to describe it if one were serious about 
   649	creating a genuine simulation.
   650	
   651	The Egyptians didn't have any such illusions either, but, in addition to 
   652	keeping track of cubits and high water, they found symbols useful for 
   653	their elaborate liturgical purposes.  With so many dramatis personae in 
   654	the pantheon, some method was required for sorting out each one's 
   655	ritualistic preferences.
   656	
   657	The Greeks, as was their wont, expanded the envelope further.  To the 
   658	previously established (and sensible) uses for writing, they added 
   659	commentary, philosophy, calculation and drama.  
   660	
   661	Still, they restrained themselves from attempting to simulate 
   662	experience on paper (or whatever it was they wrote on).  One might 
   663	argue that drama was an effort to do that, but I think that the likes of 
   664	Sophocles probably just found it easier not to have to personally teach 
   665	his actors all their lines. 
   666	
   667	As early as the 5th Century B.C. we hear the first warnings that 
   668	information might constitute an abuse of experience.  Socrates 
   669	suggested that writing things down might damage your ability to 
   670	remember them in their proper, full-bodied form.  (An admonition we 
   671	know about since Plato went ahead and wrote it down as soon as 
   672	Socrates was hemlocked out of the ability to stop him.)
   673	
   674	It wasn't until the 17th Century that things really got out of hand.  
   675	Cervantes wrote Don Quixote and fiction was born.  From that point, 
   676	any experience could be plucked from its holy moment in time and 
   677	pressed like a flower in a book, to be reconstituted later in the 
   678	imagination of the reader.   
   679	
   680	The thin, alphanumeric trickle that is language was suddenly thought 
   681	to be a acceptable surrogate for the boiling torrent of shapes, smells, 
   682	colors, sounds, memories, and context which amalgamate in the 
   683	cauldron of a human skull and become there something called Reality.  
   684	No longer did one have to "be there."  One could read about it and get 
   685	the flavor well enough.    
   686	
   687	This absurd delusion is now universal.  The only reason anyone 
   688	believes it is that everyone does.  
   689	
   690	I, on the other hand, began to have my doubts around the time I 
   691	started trying to create some of this magical information myself.  
   692	Sometime in the 4th Grade, I began to write about the things that 
   693	happened to me.  For awhile, the approval others showed my efforts 
   694	was enough to inspire their continuation.
   695	
   696	Gradually, however, the effort became painful.  The inadequacy of my 
   697	word-replicas for experience was increasingly clear.  I tried poetry.  
   698	This seemed to work until I realized that it did so because a poem is 
   699	about itself and thus has no "real thing" to be compared to.
   700	
   701	Writing about something continues to cause me nothing but anguish.  
   702	The symbolic tools are hopelessly mis-matched to their three-
   703	dimensional analogues.  For example, the word "chair" is in no way 
   704	like any chair.  
   705	
   706	Nor does it begin to imply the vast range of dissimilar objects to which 
   707	one might apply it.  You can hop it up with adjectives... "big red 
   708	chair"...or additional phrases... "big red chair that Washington sat 
   709	in"...but the result is usually bad writing without much advancement 
   710	of your cause.  I mean, "the big, deeply red, densely-brocaded, 
   711	Georgian love seat that Washington sat in while being bled by leeches" 
   712	is still, for all its lugubrious mass, not a chair.
   713	
   714	And if it were, it wouldn't move in the way that real things do even 
   715	when they're standing still.  Words just sit there.  Reality vibrates and 
   716	hums.  I have a pet phrase for this element of the mismatch:  Using 
   717	words to describe an experience is like using bricks to build a full-
   718	sized, operational model of a fog bank.
   719	
   720	Perhaps it was a subliminal recognition of this fact that caused 
   721	America to fall in love with statistics.  As a descriptive tool, numbers 
   722	are even worse than words.  They are very purely themselves and 
   723	nothing else.  Nevertheless, we now put everything from flowing 
   724	water to the human psyche into these rigid numerical boxes and are 
   725	especially straight-faced as we claim it fits in them.
   726	
   727	In doing this, we usually follow a rule I call, with characteristic 
   728	modesty, Barlow's Law of Real Numbers.  This states that the 
   729	combination of any two speculative numbers by any arithmetic 
   730	operation will always yield a real number.  The more decimal places 
   731	the better.
   732	
   733	Computers have hardly been part of the solution in this area.  We pass 
   734	our measuring grids over pulsating reality, shovel the results into our 
   735	machines, thrash them with micro-circuits, and pretend that what 
   736	floats up to the screen is "real."
   737	
   738	Horseshit.
   739	
   740	What computers can do, and have done to a fare-thee-well, is to 
   741	provide us with a hyper-abundance of such processed lies.  Everything 
   742	from U.S. News and World Report to Penthouse is now a dense thicket 
   743	of charts, tables, graphs, and %'s.  All purporting to tell us something 
   744	about what is.  
   745	
   746	But it's all just information.  Which, apart from the fact that it's not to 
   747	be confused with experience,  has several problems which Jaron Lanier 
   748	succinctly enumerated for me: "The first problem is that it's in-
   749	formation.  The second problem is that it's linear information.  And the 
   750	third problem is that it's false information." 
   751	
   752	Or, as we say in Wyoming, "Figures don't lie, but liars can figure."
   753	
   754	Virtual Reality is probably not going to cure this nonsense any more 
   755	than television, its one-way predecessor, has done.  The global supply 
   756	of words, numbers, statistics, projections, analyses, and gossip...what I 
   757	call the DataCloud... expands with thermonuclear vigor and all the 
   758	Virtual Reality we can manufacture isn't going to stop that.
   759	
   760	But it may go a long way toward giving us means to communicate 
   761	which are based on shared experience rather than what we can 
   762	squeeze through this semi-permeable alphanumeric membrane.  If it 
   763	won't contain the DataCloud, it might at least provide some 
   764	navigational aids through it.
   765	
   766	Maybe it can scratch our eyes, blinded by information, back in again.
