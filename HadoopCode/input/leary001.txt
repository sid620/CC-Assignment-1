    15	     People jacked in so they could hustle. Put the trodes on and
    16	they were out there, all the data in the world stacked up like one
    17	big neon city, so you could cruise around and have a grip on it,
    18	visually anyway, because if you didn't, it was too complicated,
    19	trying to find your way to a particular piece of data you needed.
    20	Iconics, Gentry called that.

    26	  Information is more basic
    27	than matter and energy.
    28	
    29	  Atoms, electrons, quarks

    32	  Binary units of

    37	
    38	  And in the brain.

    40	  The behavior of these bits,

    50	A UNIVERSE OF BITS AND BYTES
    51	
    52	     Major historical accomplishments of the 20th century included
    53	the personalization and popularization of Quantum Physics, an
    54	acceptance of self-reference and circular causality in systems of
    55	mathematics and psychology, and the resulting development of
    56	cybernetic society.
    57	     This philosophic achievement, which has dominated the culture
    58	of the 20th century, was based on a discovery by nuclear and
    59	quantum physicists around 1900, that visible-tangible realities
    60	are written in a digital assembly language we could accurately
    61	call "basic."
    62	     It turns out that we inhabit a universe made up of a small
    63	number of elements-particles-bits which cluster together in
    64	geometrically-logical, temporary configurations.
    65	     The solid Newtonian Universe rested upon such immutable
    66	General-Motors concepts as mass, force, momentum, and inertia,
    67	cast into a Manichaean drama involving equal reactions of good vs.
    68	evil, gravity vs. levity, entropy vs. evolution and coerced by
    69	such pious Bank-of-England notions as conservation of energy. This
    70	dependable, static, predictable, universe suddenly, in the minds
    71	of Planck/Heisenberg became digitized, transformed into shimmering
    72	quantum screens of electronic probabilities.
    73	     Up here in 1988, we are learning to experience what Nils
    74	Bohr and Werner Heisenberg could only dream of. The universe,
    75	according to their cyberdelic equations, is best described as a
    76	digital information process with sub-programs and temporary ROM
    77	states, megas called galaxies, maxis called stars, minis called
    78	planets, micros called organisms, and nanos known as molecules,
    79	atoms, particles. All of these programs are perpetually in states
    80	of evolution, i.e., continually "running."
    81	     It seems to follow that the great intellectual challenge of
    82	the 20th century was to make this universe "user friendly," to
    83	prepare individual human beings to decode, digitize, store,
    84	process & reflect the sub-programs which make up his/her own
    85	personal realities.
    86	
    87	
    88	NOBODY KNEW WHAT THESE GUYS WERE TALKING ABOUT
    89	
    90	     The chain of events that elevated us to this new genetic
    91	status, HOMO SAPIENS CYBERNETICUS, began around the turn of the
    92	century.
    93	     Physicists, we recall, are traditionally assigned the task of
    94	sorting out the nature of reality. So it was the quantum
    95	philosophers who figured out that units of energy/matter were sub-
    96	atomic bits of programmed information that zoom around in clouds
    97	of ever-changing, if/then, start/stop, off/on, 0/1, yin/yang
    98	probabilities in clusters of pixels, up-and-down recurring
    99	stairways of paradox.
   100	     When they started out, no one understood what these guys were
   101	talking about. They expressed their unsettling theories in complex
   102	equations written on blackboards with chalk. Believe it or not,
   103	these great physicists thought and communicated with a neolithic
   104	took -- chalk-marks on the wall of the cave. The irony was this:
   105	Einstein and his brilliant colleagues could not experience or
   106	operate of communicate at a quantum-electronic level.
   107	     Imagine if Max Planck pottering around in his mathematical
   108	chalk-board had access to a video-arcade game! He'd see right away
   109	that the blips on Centipede and the zaps of Space Invaders could
   110	represent the movement of the very particles that he tried to
   111	describe in the dusty symbols of his blackboard.
   112	
   113	
   114	A WILD AND SCARY HALLUCINOGENIQUE
   115	
   116	     Now let us reflect on the head-bursting adjustment required
   117	here. The relativistic universe described by Einstein and the
   118	nuclear physicists IS alien and terrifying. Quantum physics is
   119	quite literally a wild, confusing psyberdelic trip. It postulates
   120	an Alice-in-Wonderland, Sartrean universe in which everything is
   121	changing. As Heisenberg implied: nothing is certain except
   122	uncertainty. Matter is energy. Energy and matter are temporary
   123	states of info-bits, frozen at various forms of acceleration.
   124	     This digital universe is not user-friendly when approached
   125	with a Newtonian mind. We are just now beginning to write a manual
   126	of operations for the brain and the universe, both of which, it
   127	turns out, are digital galaxies with amazing similarities.
   128	     People living in the solid, mechanical world of 1901 simply
   129	could not understand or experience a quantum universe. Dear sweet
   130	old Einstein, who couldn't accept his own unsettling equations,
   131	was denounced as evil and immoral by Catholic bishops and sober
   132	theologians who sensed how unsettling and revolutionary these new
   133	ideas could be. Ethical relativity is still the mortal sin of
   134	religious fundamentalists.
   135	
   136	
   137	THE CYBERPUNK AS MODERN ALCHEMIST
   138	
   139	     The baby boom generation has grown up in an electronic world
   140	of TV and personal computing screens. The cyberpunks offer
   141	metaphors, rituals, life styles for dealing with the universe of
   142	information. More and more of us are becoming electro-shamans,
   143	modern alchemists.
   144	     Alchemists of the Middle Ages described the construction of
   145	magical appliances for viewing future events, or speaking to
   146	friends distant or dead. Writings of Paracelsus describe a mirror
   147	of ELECTRUM MAGICUM with telegenic properties, and crystal scrying
   148	was in its heyday.
   149	     Today, digital alchemists have at their command tools of a
   150	precision and power unimagined by their predecessors. Computer
   151	screens ARE magical mirrors, presenting alternate realities at
   152	varying degrees of abstraction on command (invocation). Aleister
   153	Crowley defined magick as "the art and science of causing change
   154	to occur in conformity with our will," and to this end the
   155	computer is the universal level of Archimedes.
   156	     The parallels between the culture of the alchemists and that
   157	of cyberpunk computer adepts are inescapable. Both employ
   158	knowledge of an occult arcanum unknown to the population at large,
   159	with secret symbols and words of power. The "secret symbols"
   160	comprise the languages of computers and mathematics, and the
   161	"words of power" instruct computer operating systems to complete
   162	Herculean tasks. Knowing the precise code name of a digital
   163	program permits it to be conjured into existence, transcending the
   164	labor of muscular or mechanical search or manufacture.
   165	     Rites of initiation or apprenticeship are common to both.
   166	"Psychic feats" of telepathy and action-at-a-distance are achieved
   167	by selection of the menu option.
   168	
   169	
   170	CLASSICAL MAGICKAL CORRESPONDENCES
   171	
   172	     Alchemists of the Middle Ages believed quite correctly that
   173	their cosmos was composed of four elements: earth, air, fire and
   174	water. Although today our periodic table sports more than 100
   175	chemical elements, the four universal elements still can be
   176	identified as the constituents of some processes in the external
   177	reality, and within the inner psychological world of humankind.
   178	     Each of the four elements is an archetype and a metaphor, a
   179	convenient and appropriate name for a universally identified
   180	quality. The four are echoed in the organization of both the four
   181	suits and the four "court cards" of each suit of the Tarot,
   182	inherited from the Egyptians and its symbolism preserved in
   183	ordinary Western playing cards. The four also correspond to the
   184	four principal tools of the classical practitioner of ceremonial
   185	magick.
   186	     The wand of the magician represents the phallic male creative
   187	force, fire. The cup stands for the female receptive force, and,
   188	obviously enough, is associated with water. the sword is the
   189	incisive intellect, moving and severing the air, the abstraction
   190	in which it moves. Finally, the pantacle (disk) is the grounding
   191	in earth (magnetic material), the stored algorithms. (We use
   192	Crowley's spelling of pentacle, which communicates the sense of
   193	"all and everything," advisedly.)
   194	
   195	     These classical instruments of magick exist in modern cyber
   196	technology: The mouse or pen of the digitizing tablet is the wand,
   197	controlling the fire of the CRT display and harnessing the
   198	creative force of the programmer. It is used in all invocations
   199	and ritual as a tool of command. Spinning disk drives are the
   200	pantacles, inscribed with complex symbols, earthen tablets to
   201	receive the input of "air," the crackling dynamic ethereal
   202	intellectual electricity of the processor chip circuitry
   203	programming results. The RAM chips are, literally, the buffers
   204	("buffer pools"), the water, the passive element capable of only
   205	receiving impressions and re-transmitting, reflecting.
   206	     Iconic visual programming languages are a Tarot, the
   207	pictorial summation of all possibilities, activated for the
   208	purpose of divination by juxtaposition and mutual influence. A
   209	periodic table of possibilities, the Western form of the Eastern
   210	I Ching. Traditional word-oriented programming languages, FORTRAN,
   211	COBOL, and the rest, are a degenerate form of these universal
   212	systems, grimoires of profit-oriented corporations.
   213	     Detailed database logs of the activity of operating systems
   214	from the Akashic records on a microscale. At a macroscopic level,
   215	this is the "world net" knowledge base, the "knoesphere," the
   216	world-wide online hypertext network of information soon to be
   217	realized by the storage capacity of CD ROM and the data
   218	transmission capability of optical fiber. William Gibson's
   219	cyberspace matrix.
   220	     Banishing rituals debug programs, and friendly djinn are
   221	invoked for compiling, searching, and other mundane tasks. When
   222	the magic circle is broken (segmentation violation), the system
   223	collapses. Personal transmutation (the ecstasy of the "ultimate
   224	hack") is a veiled goal of both systems. The satori of harmonious
   225	human-computer communication resulting from the infinite regress
   226	into meta-levels of reflection of self is the reward for
   227	immaculate conceptualization and execution of ideas.
   228	     The universality of 0 and 1 throughout magic and religion:
   229	yin and yang, yoni and lingam, cup and wand, are manifested today
   230	in digital signals, the two bits underlying the implementation of
   231	all digital programs in the world, in our brains and in our
   232	operating systems. Stretching it a bit, even the monad, symbol of
   233	change and the Tao, visually resembles a superimposed 0 and 1 when
   234	its curving central line is stretched through the action of
   235	centrifugal force from the ever-increasing speed of the monad's
   236	rotation.
   237	
   238	
   239	CYBER RELIGION OF THE BABY BOOMERS
   240	
   241	     By the year 2000, Aleister Crowley, William Gibson, and
   242	Edward Fredkin could well replace Benjamin Spock as a Baby Boom
   243	navigator. Why? Because, by then the concerns of the baby boom
   244	generation will be digital. (Or, to use the old paradigms,
   245	philosophic-spiritual.)
   246	     During their childhood they were Mouseketeers. In their teens
   247	the Cybers went on an adolescent spiritual binge unequalled since
   248	the Children's Crusade. In their revolt against the factory
   249	culture they re-invented and updated their tribal-pagan roots and
   250	experimented with Hinduism, Haight-Ashbury Buddhism, American
   251	Indianism, Magic, Witchcraft, Ann Arbor Voo Doo, Esalen Yoga,
   252	Computerized I Ching Taoism, 3-D Reincarnation, Fluid Druidism.
   253	St. Stephen Jobs to the Ashram!
   254	     Born-again Paganism! Pan-Dionysius on audio-visual cassettes.
   255	Mick Jagger had them sympathizing with the devil. The Beatles had
   256	them floating upstream on the Ganges. Jimi Hendrix taught them how
   257	to be a voodoo child. Is there one pre-Christian or third world
   258	metaphor for divinity that some rock group has not yet celebrated
   259	on an album cover?
   260	
   261	
   262	ONTOLOGY RECAPITULATES THEOLOGY
   263	
   264	     The Boomers in the evolving life-cycle seem to have
   265	recapitulated the theological history of our species. Just as
   266	monotheism emerged to unify pagan tribes into nations, so did the
   267	Boomers re-discover fundamentalist Judaism and Christianity in
   268	their young adulthood.
   269	     Even far-away Islam attracted gourmet Blacks and ex-hippies
   270	such as Cat Stevens. Bob Dylan nicely exemplifies the consumer
   271	approach to religion. For 25 years Bob (ne Zimmerman) has
   272	continued to browse through the spiritual boutiques dabbing on a
   273	dash of Baptist "born-again," nibbling at Hassidism before
   274	returning to his ole-time faith of sardonic reformed humanism.
   275	     We can laugh at this trendy shopping around for the custom-
   276	tailored designer god, but behind the faddism we find a powerful
   277	clue.
   278	     Notice how Dylan, for example, preserves his options and
   279	tries to avoid shoddy of off-the-rack soul-ware. No "plastic
   280	christs that glow in the dark" for Bob! The religion here is
   281	Evolutionism, based on the classic humanist, transcendental
   282	assumptions:
   283	
   284	1.   God is not a tribal father nor a feudal lord nor an engineer-
   285	     manager of the universe. There is no god (in the singular)
   286	     except you at the moment. There are as many gods (in the
   287	     plural) as can be imagined. Call them whatever you like.
   288	     They are free agents like you and me.
   289	
   290	
   291	2.   You can change and mutate and keep improving. The idea is to
   292	     keep "trading up" to a "better" philosophy-theology.
   293	
   294	3.   The aim of your life, following Buddha, Krishna, Gurdjieff,
   295	     Werner Erhart, Shirley, is this:
   296	     Take care of your self so you can take care of others. If
   297	     any.
   298	
   299	
   300	WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM YOUR FRIENDS
   301	
   302	     This generation, we recall, had been disillusioned by the
   303	religions, politics, & economics of their parents. Growing up with
   304	the threat of nuclear war, the assassination of beloved leaders,
   305	immune deficiencies, a collapsing industrial system, an impossible
   306	national debt, religious fundamentalisms (Christian-Jewish-
   307	Islamic) that fanatically scream hatred and intolerance, and
   308	uncomprehending neglect of the ecology, they have developed a
   309	healthy skepticism about collective solutions.
   310	     They can't retreat back home because Mom and Dad are
   311	divorced.
   312	     No wonder they have created a psychology of individual
   313	navigation. Singularity. The basic idea is self-responsibility.
   314	You just can't depend on anyone else to solve your problems. You
   315	gotta do it all by yourself -- With a little help from your
   316	friends.
   317	
   318	
   319	A DO-IT-YOURSELF RELIGION
   320	
   321	     Since God #1 appears to be held hostage back there by the
   322	blood-thirsty Persian Ayatollah, by the telegenic Polish Pope and
   323	the Moral Majority, there's only one logical alternative. You
   324	"steer" your own course. You start your own religion. The Temple
   325	is your body. Your mind writes the theology. And the Holy Spirit
   326	emanates from that infinitely mysterious intersection between your
   327	brain and your DNA.
   328	     The attainment of even the suburbs of Paradise involves good
   329	navigation and planning on your part. Hell is a series of
   330	redeemable errors. A detour caused by failure to check the trip-
   331	maps. A losing streak. Many people are carefully conditioned from
   332	birth to live in hell. As children, they are largely ignored until
   333	something happens to cause them pain or injury. Then, mommy and
   334	daddy quickly lavish aid, attention, succor, positive
   335	reinforcement. When "all grown up," and in the world alone to make
   336	choices, what kind of choices are going to result from those many
   337	years of conditioning? It's no wonder so many people seem to live
   338	in hell, to live pained lives of mishaps and broken dreams. Of
   339	course, by realizing this we can begin to decondition ourselves
   340	towards healthy hedonism. Reward yourself for making choices that
   341	lead to pleasure, and build a cybernetic cycle of positive
   342	feedback. Only from the state of free selfhood can any truly
   343	compassionate signals be sent to others.
   344	
   345	
   346	THE ADMINISTRATION OF A PERSONAL STATE
   347	
   348	     The management and piloting of a Singularity leads to a very
   349	busy career. Since the Crowley-Gibson-Fredkin Individual has
   350	established herself as a religion, a country, a corporation, an
   351	information network, and a neurological universe, it is necessary
   352	to maintain personal equivalents for all the departments and
   353	operations of the bureaucracies that perform these duties.
   354	     This apparently means forming private alliances, formulating
   355	personal political platforms, conducting your own domestic and
   356	foreign relations, establishing trade policies, defense and
   357	security programs, educational and recreational events. On the
   358	upside, one is free from dependence upon bureaucracies, an
   359	inestimable boon. (Free agents can, of course, make temporary
   360	deals with organizations and officials thereof.)
   361	     And if countries have histories and myths, why shouldn't you?
   362	
   363	
   364	THE PERSONAL MYTHOLOGY
   365	
   366	     So you search and research your very own genetic memory
   367	banks, the Old Testaments of your DNA-RNA, including, if you like,
   368	past incarnations and Jungian archetypes. And funky pre-
   369	incarnations in any future you can imagine!
   370	     You write your very own Newest Testament, recalling that
   371	voluntary martyrdom is tacky and crucifixions, like nuclear war,
   372	can ruin your day.
   373	     You can do anything the great religions, empires and racial
   374	groups have done in the name of their God #1. and you're certain
   375	to do it better because... well, look at their track records.
   376	There's no way your Personal State could produce the persecutions,
   377	massacres and bigotries of the Big Guys.
   378	     Why? Because there's only one of you, and even with the help
   379	of your friends the amount of damage an individual can do is
   380	insignificant compared with the evil-potential of a collective.
   381	     Besides, you're a child of the 60s. You're imprinted to want
   382	a peaceful, tolerant, funny world. You can choose your gods to be
   383	smart, funny, compassionate, cute and goofy.
   384	
   385	
   386	IRREVERENCE IS A PASSWORD FOR THE 21ST CENTURY
   387	
   388	     It has been suggested that the philosophic assignment of the
   389	Roaring 20th Century was to prepare the human species for the
   390	shifting realities of Quantum Physics and Singular Steering.
   391	     Relativity means that everyone "sees" or reacts to things
   392	differently, depending upon location, velocity and attitude (angle
   393	of approach).
   394	     The relativistic insight is in essence irreverent or
   395	humorous, i.e., laughable, comical, delightful. With the law of
   396	gravity repealed, levity is the order of the day. We rise through
   397	our levity, instead of being held down by our gravity.
   398	     The word "humor" comes from the Latin word for liquid or
   399	fluid, referring to such qualities as flowing, pliable, smooth,
   400	effortless, easily changed, non-frictional, transparent, shining,
   401	musical, graceful in motion and readily converted into cash.

   407	THE LAST GENERATION IN FLESH?
   408	
   409	     Through science and technology we will meet the aliens, and
   410	they will be us.
   411	                       -- Norman Spinrad, "The Neuromantics"
   412	
   413	     Information-beings of the future may well be fluid. Human
   414	society has now reached a turning point in the operation of the
   415	digital programs of evolution, a point at which the next
   416	evolutionary steps of the species become apparent to us, to surf
   417	as we will. Or, more correctly, as the evolutionary programs run
   418	and run, the next stages pop up in parallel, resulting in
   419	continuing explosions of unexpected diversity. Our concepts of
   420	what is known as "human" continually change. For example, we are
   421	no longer as dependent on physical fitness for survival. Our
   422	quantum appliances and improved mechanical devices can generally
   423	provide the requisite means or defenses. In the near future, the
   424	methods of information technology, molecular engineering,
   425	biotechnology, nanotechnology (atom stacking) and quantum-digital
   426	programming could make the human form a matter totally determined
   427	by individual whim, style and seasonal choice.
   428	     Humans already come in some variety of races and sizes. In
   429	comparison to what "human" might mean within the next century, we
   430	humans are at present as indistinguishable from one another as are
   431	hydrogen molecules. Along with the irrational taboo about death,
   432	the sanctity of our body image seems to be one of the most
   433	persistent anachronisms of Industrial Age thought.
   434	     We see evolutions of the human form in the future; one more
   435	biological-like: a bio/computer hybrid of any desired form -- and
   436	one not biological at all: an "electronic entity" in the digital
   437	info-universe.
   438	     Human-AS-programs, and human-IN-programs.
   439	     Of these two post-humanist views, human-as-programs is more
   440	easily conceived. Today, we have crude prosthetic implants,
   441	artificial limbs, valves, and entire organs. The continuing
   442	improvements in the old-style mechanical technology slowly
   443	increase the thoroughness of brain/external-world integration. A
   444	profound change can come with the developments of biotechnology,
   445	genetic engineering, and the slightly more remote success of
   446	nanotechnology.
   447	     The electronic form of human-in-programs is more alien to our
   448	current conceptions of humanity. Through storage of one's belief
   449	systems as data structures online, driven by desired programs
   450	one's neuronal apparatus should operate in silicon basically as it
   451	dead on the meatware of the brain, though faster, more accurately,
   452	more a is systems as data s8e plehouldoi.
