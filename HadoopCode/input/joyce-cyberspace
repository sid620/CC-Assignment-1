    27	[1]       _The Gutenberg Galaxy_, a book which redirected the way
    28	     that artists, critics, scholars and communicators viewed the
    29	     role of technological mediation in communication and
    30	     expression, had its origin in Marshall McLuhan's desire to
    31	     write a book called "The Road to _Finnegans Wake_."  It has
    32	     not been widely recognized just how important James Joyce's
    33	     major writings were to McLuhan, or to other major figures
    34	     (such as Jorge Luis Borges, John Cage, Jacques Derrida,
    35	     Umberto Eco, and Jacques Lacan) who have written about
    36	     aspects of communication involving technological mediation,
    37	     speech, writing, and electronics.  While all of these
    38	     connections should be explored, the most enthusiastic
    39	     Joycean of them all, McLuhan, provides the most specific
    40	     bridge linking the work of Joyce and his modernist
    41	     contemporaries to the development of electric communication
    42	     and to the prehistory of cyberspace and virtual reality.
    43	     McLuhan's scouting of "the Road to _Finnegans Wake_"
    44	     established him as the first major disseminator of those
    45	     Joycean insights which have become the unacknowledged basis
    46	     for our thinking about technoculture, just as the pervasive
    47	     McLuhanesque vocabulary has become a part, often an
    48	     unconscious one, of our verbal heritage.
    49	[2]       In the mid-80s, William Gibson first identified the
    50	     emergence of cyberspace as the most recent moment in the
    51	     development of electromechanical communications, telematics
    52	     and virtual reality.  Cyberspace, as Gibson saw it, is the
    53	     simultaneous experience of time, space, and the flow of
    54	     multi-dimensional, pan-sensory data:
    55	          All the data in the world stacked up like one big neon
    56	          city, so you could cruise around and have a kind of
    57	          grip on it, visually anyway, because if you didn't, it
    58	          was too complicated, trying to find your way to the
    59	          particular piece of data you needed.  Iconics, Gentry
    60	          called that.^1^
    61	     This "consensual hallucination" produced by "data abstracted
    62	     from the banks of every computer in the human system"
    63	     creates an "unthinkable complexity.  Lines of light ranged
    64	     in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of
    65	     data.  Like city lights receding."^2^  Almost a decade
    66	     earlier, McLuhan's remarks about computers (dating from the
    67	     late 70s) display some striking similarities:^3^
    68	          It steps up the velocity of logical sequential
    69	          calculations to the speed of light reducing numbers to
    70	          body count by touch . . . .  It brings back the
    71	          Pythagorean occult embodied in the idea that "numbers
    72	          are all"; and at the same time it dissolves hierarchy
    73	          in favor of decentralization.  When applied to new
    74	          forms of electronic-messaging such as teletext and
    75	          videotext, it quickly converts sequential alphanumeric
    76	          texts into multi-level signs and aphorisms, encouraging
    77	          ideographic summation, like hieroglyphs.^4^
    78	     McLuhan's %hieroglyphs% certainly more than anticipate
    79	     Gibson's %iconics% and McLuhan's particular use of
    80	     hieroglyph or iconology, like that of mosaic, primarily
    81	     derives from Joyce and Giambattista Vico.
    82	[3]       It is not surprising then that McLuhan's works, side by
    83	     side with those of Gibson, have been avidly read by early
    84	     researchers in MIT's Media Lab^5^, for these researchers
    85	     also conceive of a VR composed, like the tribal and
    86	     collective "global village," of "tactile, haptic,
    87	     proprioceptive and acoustic spaces and involvements."^6^
    88	     The experiments of the artistic avant-garde movements (such
    89	     as the Dadaists, the Bauhaus and the Surrealists) and of
    90	     individuals (such as Marcel Duchamp, Paul Klee, Sergei
    91	     Eisenstein or Luis Bunuel) generated the exploration of the
    92	     semiotics and technical effects of such spaces and
    93	     involvements.  Duchamp, for example, became an early leading
    94	     figure in splitting apart the presumed generic boundaries of
    95	     painting and sculpture to explore arts of motion, light,
    96	     movement, gesture, and concept, exemplified in his _Large
    97	     Glass_^7^ and the serial publication of his accompanying
    98	     notes from _The Box of 1914_ through _The Green Box_ to _A
    99	     l'infinitif_.  His interest in the notes as part of the
   100	     total work echo Joyce's own interest in the publication of
   101	     _Work in Progress_ and commentaries he organized upon it
   102	     (e.g., _Our Exagmination Round his Factification for
   103	     Incamination of Work in Progress_).  Joyce also explores
   104	     similar aspects of motion, light, movement, gesture and
   105	     concept.  So the road to VR and MIT's Media Lab begins with
   106	     poetic and artistic experimentation in the late nineteenth
   107	     and early twentieth century; later, as Stuart Brand notes,
   108	     many of the Media Lab researchers of the 60s and 70s placed
   109	     great importance on collaboration with artists involved in
   110	     exploring the nature and art of motion and in investigating
   111	     new relationships between sight, hearing, and the other
   112	     senses.^8^
   113	[4]       Understanding the social and cultural implications of
   114	     VR and cyberspace requires a radical reassessment of the
   115	     inter-relationships between Gibson's now commonplace
   116	     description of cyberspace, McLuhan's modernist-influenced
   117	     vision of the development of electric media, and the
   118	     particular impact that Joyce had both on McLuhan's writings
   119	     about electrically mediated communication and on the views
   120	     of Borges, Cage, Derrida, Eco and Lacan regarding problems
   121	     of mediation and communication.  Such a reassessment
   122	     requires that two central issues be discussed: (i) the
   123	     crucial nature of VR's challenge to the privileging of
   124	     language through the orality/literacy dichotomization used
   125	     by many theorists of language and communication; (ii) the
   126	     idea of VR's presence as *the* super-medium that encompasses
   127	     and transcends all media.  The cluster of critics who have
   128	     addressed orality and literacy, following the lead of Walter
   129	     Ong, H.A. Innis and Eric Havelock, have--like them--failed
   130	     to comprehend the fact that McLuhan was disseminating a
   131	     Joycean view which grounded communication in tactility,
   132	     gesture and CNS processes, rather than promulgating the
   133	     emergence of a new oral/aural age, a secondary orality.
   134	     This emphasis on the tactile, the gestural and the play of
   135	     the CNS in communication is a key to Joyce's literary
   136	     exploration of a theme he shared with his radical modernist
   137	     colleagues in other arts who envisioned the eventual
   138	     development of a coenaesthetic medium^9^ that would
   139	     integrate and harmonize the effects of sensory and
   140	     neurological information in currently existing and newly
   141	     emerging art forms.
   142	[5]       Joyce's work should be recognized as pioneering the
   143	     artistic exploration of two sets of differences--
   144	     orality/literacy and print/[tele-]electric media--that have
   145	     since become dominant themes in the discussion of these
   146	     questions.  _Finnegans Wake_ is one of the first major
   147	     poetic encounters with the challenge that electronic media
   148	     present to the traditionally accepted relationships between
   149	     speech, script and print.  (_Ulysses_ also involves such an
   150	     encounter, but at an earlier stage in the historic
   151	     development of mediated communication.)  Imagine Joyce
   152	     around 1930 asking the question: what is the role of the
   153	     book in a culture which has discovered photography,
   154	     phonography, radio, film, television, telegraph, cable, and
   155	     telephone and has developed newspapers, magazines,
   156	     advertising, Hollywood, and sales promotion?  What people
   157	     once read, they will now go to see in film and on
   158	     television; everyday life will appear in greater detail and
   159	     more up-to-date fashion in the press, on radio and in
   160	     television; oral poetry will be reanimated by the
   161	     potentialities of sound recording.^10^
   162	[6]       The "counter-poetic," _Finnegans Wake_, provides one of
   163	     *the* key texts regarding the problem presented by the
   164	     dichotomization of the oral and the written and by its
   165	     frequent corollary, a privileging of either speech or
   166	     language.  This enigmatic work is not only a polysemic,
   167	     encyclopedic book designed to be read with the simultaneous
   168	     involvement of ear and eye: it is also a self-reflexive book
   169	     about the role of the book in the electro-machinic world of
   170	     the new technology.^11^  The _Wake_ is the most
   171	     comprehensive exploration, prior to the 1960s or 70s, of the
   172	     ways in which these new modes created a dramatic crisis for
   173	     the arts of language and the privileged position of the
   174	     printed book.  The _Wake_ dramatizes the necessary
   175	     deconstruction and reconstruction of language in a world
   176	     where multi-semic grammars and rhetorics, combined with
   177	     entirely new modes for organizing and transmitting
   178	     information and knowledge, eventually would impose a variety
   179	     of new, highly specialized roles on speech, print and
   180	     writing.  Joyce's selection of Vico's _New Science_^12^ as
   181	     the structural scaffolding for the _Wake_--the equivalent of
   182	     Homer's _Odyssey_ in _Ulysses_--underscores how his interest
   183	     in the contemporary transformation of the book requires
   184	     grounding the evolution of civilization in the poetics of
   185	     communication, especially gesture and language and the
   186	     "prophetic" role of the poetic in shaping the future.
   187	[7]       As the world awakens to the full potentialities for the
   188	     construction of artifacts and processes of communication in
   189	     the new electric cosmos, Joyce foresees the transformation
   190	     (not the death) of the book--going beyond the book as it had
   191	     historically evolved.  Confronted with this situation, Joyce
   192	     seeks to develop a poetic language which will resituate the
   193	     book within this new communicative cosmos, while
   194	     simultaneously recognizing the drive toward the development
   195	     of a theoretically all-inclusive, all-encompassing medium,
   196	     "virtual reality."  Since the action takes place in a
   197	     dreamworld, Joyce can produce an impressively prophetic
   198	     imaginary prototype for the virtual worlds of the future.
   199	     His dreamworld envelops the reader within an aural sphere,
   200	     accompanied by kinetic and gestural components that arise
   201	     from effects of rhythm and intonation realized through the
   202	     visual act of reading; but it also reproduces imaginarily
   203	     the most complex multi-media forms and envisions how they
   204	     will utilize his present, which will have become the past,
   205	     to transform the future.^13^
   206	[8]       The hero(ine)^14^ in the _Wake_, "Here Comes
   207	     Everybody," is a communicating machine, "This harmonic
   208	     condenser enginium (the Mole)" (310.1), an electric
   209	     transmission-receiver system, an ear, the human sensorium, a
   210	     presence "eclectrically filtered for all irish earths and
   211	     ohmes."  Joyce envisions the person as embodied within an
   212	     electro-machinopolis (an electric, pan-global, machinic
   213	     environment), which becomes an extension of the human body,
   214	     an interior presence, indicated by a stress on the
   215	     playfulness of the whole person and on tactility as calling
   216	     attention to the interplay of sensory information within the
   217	     electro-chemical neurological system.  This medley of
   218	     elements and concerns, focussed on questioning the place of
   219	     oral and written language in an electro-mechanical
   220	     technoculture that engenders more and more comprehensive
   221	     modes of communication biased towards the dramatic, marks
   222	     Joyce as a key figure in the pre-history of virtual reality.
   223	[9]       Acutely sensitive to the inseparable involvement of
   224	     speech, script, and print with the visual, the auditory, the
   225	     kinesthetic and other modes of expression, Joyce roots all
   226	     communication in gesture: "In the beginning was the gest he
   227	     jousstly says" (468.5-6).  Here the originary nature of
   228	     gesture (gest, F. %geste% = gesture)^15^ is linked with the
   229	     mechanics of humor (i.e., jest) and to telling a tale
   230	     (gest as a feat and a tale or romance).  Gestures, like
   231	     signals and flashing lights that provide elementary
   232	     mechanical systems for communications, are "words of silent
   233	     power" (345.19).  A traffic crossing sign, "Belisha beacon,
   234	     beckon bright" (267.12), exemplifies such situations "Where
   235	     flash becomes word and silents selfloud."  Since gestures,
   236	     and ultimately all acts of communication, are generated from
   237	     the body, the "gest" as "flesh without word" (468.5-6) is "a
   238	     flash" that becomes word and "communicake[s] with the
   239	     original sinse" [originary sense + the temporal, "since" +
   240	     original sin (239.1)].  "Communicake" parallels eating to
   241	     speaking, and speaking is linked in turn to the act of
   242	     communion as participation in, and consumption of, the
   243	     Word--an observation adumbrated in the title of one of
   244	     Marcel Jousse's groundbreaking books on gesture as the
   245	     origin of language, _La Manducation de la Parole_ ("The
   246	     Mastication of the Word").  By treating the "gest" as a bit
   247	     (a bite), orality and the written word as projections of
   248	     gesture can be seen to spring from the body as a
   249	     communicating machine.^16^  The historical processes that
   250	     contribute to the development of cyberspace augment the
   251	     growing emphasis, in theories such as Kenneth Burke's, on
   252	     the idea that the goal of the symbolic action called
   253	     communication is *secular, paramodern communion*.^17^
   254	[10]      The _Wake_ provides a self-reflexive explanation of the
   255	     communicative process of encoding and decoding required to
   256	     interpret an encoded text, which itself is
   257	     characteristically mechanical:
   258	          The prouts who will invent a writing there ultimately
   259	          is the poeta, still more learned, who discovered the
   260	          raiding there originally.  That's the point of
   261	          eschatology our book of kills reaches for now in
   262	          soandso many counterpoint words.  What can't be coded
   263	          can be decorded if an ear aye seize what no eye ere
   264	          grieved for.  Now, the doctrine obtains, we have
   265	          occasioning cause causing effects and affects
   266	          occasionally recausing altereffects.  Or I will let me
   267	          take it upon myself to suggest to twist the penman's
   268	          tale posterwise.  The gist is the gist of Shaum but the
   269	          hand is the hand of Sameas.  (482.31-483.4)
   270	     The dreamer as a poet, a Hermetic thief, an "outlex"
   271	     (169.3)--i.e., an outlaw, lawless, beyond the word and,
   272	     therefore, the law, "invents" the writing by originally
   273	     discovering the reading of the book and does so by "raiding"
   274	     [i.e., "plundering" (reading + raiding)].^18^  This reading
   275	     encompasses both the idealistic "eschatology" and the
   276	     excrementitious-materialistic (pun on scatology) within the
   277	     designing of this "book of kills" (deaths, deletions,
   278	     drinking sessions, flows of water--a counterpoint of
   279	     continuity and discontinuity),^19^ a book as carefully
   280	     crafted or machined as the illuminations of the _Book of
   281	     Kells_ are.  Seeing and hearing are intricately involved in
   282	     this process, so the reader of this night-book also becomes
   283	     a "raider" of the original "reading-writing" through the
   284	     machinery of writing.  It is a production "in soandso many
   285	     counterpoint words" that can be read only through the
   286	     machinery of decoding, for "What can't be coded can be
   287	     decorded, if an ear aye seize what no eye ere grieved for"
   288	     (482.34).  The tale that the pen writes is transmitted by
   289	     the post, and the whole process of communication and its
   290	     interpretation is an extension of the hand and of bodily
   291	     gesture-language: "The gist is the gist of Shaum but the
   292	     hand is the hand of Sameas" (483.3-4).
   293	[11]      Orality, particularly song, is grounded in the
   294	     machinery of the body's organs: "Singalingalying.  Storiella
   295	     as she is syung.  Whence followeup with endspeaking nots for
   296	     yestures" (267.7-9).^20^  The link is rhythm, for
   297	     "Soonjemmijohns will cudgel some a rhythmatick or other over
   298	     Browne and Nolan's divisional tables" (268.7-9).  Gesture,
   299	     with its affiliation with all of the neuro-muscular
   300	     movements of the body, is a natural script or originary
   301	     writing, for the word "has been reconstricted out of oral
   302	     style into verbal for all time with ritual rhythmics"
   303	     (36.8-9).  Since the oral is "reconstricted" (reconstructed
   304	     + constricted or limited) into the verbal, words also are
   305	     crafted in relation to sound, a natural development of which
   306	     is "wordcraft": for example, hieroglyphs and primitive
   307	     script based on drawings or mnemonic devices.^21^  Runes and
   308	     ogham are literally "woodwordings," so pre- or proto-writing
   309	     (i.e., syllabic writing) is already "a mechanization of the
   310	     word," which is itself implicit in the body's use of
   311	     gesture.
   312	[12]      Joyce's practice and his theoretical orientation imply
   313	     that as the road to cyberspace unfolds, the very nature of
   314	     the word, the image, and the icon also changes.  Under the
   315	     impact of electric communication, it is once again clear
   316	     that the concept of the word must embrace artifacts and
   317	     events as well.^22^  Writing and speech are subsumed into
   318	     entirely new relationships with non-phonemic sound, image,
   319	     gesture, movement, rhythm, and all modes of sensory input,
   320	     especially the tactile.  To continue to speak about a
   321	     dichotomy of orality versus literacy is a misleading
   322	     over-simplification of the role that electric media play in
   323	     this transformation, a role best comprehended through
   324	     historical knowledge of the earliest stages of human
   325	     communication where objects, gestures and movements
   326	     apparently intermingled with verbal and non-verbal sounds.
   327	     Marschak's study of early cultural artifacts, the Aschers'
   328	     discussion of the quipu, and Levi-Strauss's discussions of
   329	     the kinship system demonstrate the relative complexity of
   330	     some ancient, non-linguistic systems of communication.^23^
   331	     Adapting Vico's speculation that human communication begins
   332	     with the gestures and material symbols of the "mute," Joyce
   333	     early in the _Wake_ presents an encounter between two
   334	     characters whose names deliberately echo Mutt and Jeff of
   335	     comic strip fame.  Mutt (until recently a mute) and Jute (a
   336	     nomadic invader) "excheck a few strong verbs weak oach
   337	     eather" (16.8-9).
   338	[13]      Beginning with gesture, hieroglyph and rune, Joyce
   339	     traces human communication through its complex, labyrinthine
   340	     development, right down to the TV and what it bodes for the
   341	     future.  For example, an entire episode of the _Wake_
   342	     (I,5)^24^ is devoted to the technology of manuscripts and
   343	     the theory of their interpretation--textual hermeneutics--in
   344	     which the _Wake_ as a book is interpreted as if it were a
   345	     manuscript, "the proteiform graph is a polyhedron of all
   346	     scripture" (107.8).  At each stage, Joyce recognizes how the
   347	     machinery of codification is implicit in the history of
   348	     communication, for discussing this manuscript, he observes
   349	     that
   350	          on holding the verso against a lit rush this new
   351	          book of Morses responded most remarkably to the silent
   352	          query of our world's oldest light and its recto let out
   353	          the piquant fact that it was but pierced but not
   354	          punctured (in the university sense of the term) by
   355	          numerous stabs and foliated gashes made by a pronged
   356	          instrument. . . .  (123.34-124.3)
   357	     This illustrates how the beginning of electric media (the
   358	     telegraph) is a transformation of the potentialities of the
   359	     early manuscript, just as any manuscript is a transformation
   360	     of the "wordcraft" of "woodwordings."  "Morse code" is
   361	     indicative of the mechanics of codification, for while code
   362	     is essential to all communication (thus prior to the moment
   363	     when the mechanical is electrified), the role of
   364	     codification is radically transformed by mechanization.
   365	[14]      The appearance of the printing press demonstrates the
   366	     effect of this radical transformation:
   367	          Gutenmorg with his cromagnon charter, tintingfast
   368	          and great primer must once for omniboss step
   369	          rubrickredd out of the wordpress else is there no
   370	          virtue more in alcohoran.  For that (the rapt one
   371	          warns) is what papyr is meed of, made of, hides and
   372	          hints and misses in prints.  Till ye finally (though
   373	          not yet endlike) meet with the acquaintance of Mister
   374	          Typus, Mistress Tope and all the little typtopies.
   375	          Fillstup.  So you need hardly spell me how every word
   376	          will be bound over to carry three score and ten
   377	          toptypsical readings throughout the book of Doublends
   378	          Jined . . . .  (20.7-16)
   379	     As "Gutenmorg with his cromagnon charter, tintingfast and
   380	     great primer" steps "rubrickredd out of the wordpress," the
   381	     dream reminds us that "papyr is meed of, made of, hides and
   382	     hints and misses in prints."  Topics (L. %topos%) and types
   383	     (L. %typus%) as figures, forms, images, topics and
   384	     commonplaces, the elemental bits of writing and rhetoric,
   385	     are now realized through typesetting.  Implicit in the
   386	     technology of print is the complex intertextuality of verbal
   387	     ambivalence, for "every word will be bound over to carry
   388	     three score and ten toptypsical readings throughout the book
   389	     of Doublends Jined."  Printing sets in place the "root
   390	     language" (424.17) residing in the types and topes of the
   391	     world and potentially eliminates a multitude of alternate
   392	     codes such as actual sounds, visual images, real objects,
   393	     movements, and gestures that will re-emerge with the
   394	     electromechanical march towards VR and cyberspace.
   395	[15]      By the 1930s, in a pub scene in the _Wake_, Joyce
   396	     playfully anticipated how central sporting events or
   397	     political debates would be for television when he described
   398	     the TV projection of a fight being viewed by the pub's
   399	     "regulars" (possibly the first fictional TV bar room scene
   400	     in literary history).  Joyce's presentation of this image of
   401	     the battle of Butt and Taff, which is peppered with complex
   402	     puns involving terminology associated with the technical
   403	     details of TV transmission, has its own metamorphic quality,
   404	     underscored by the "viseversion" (vice versa imaging) of
   405	     Butt and Taff's images on "the bairdboard bombardment
   406	     screen" ("bairdboard" because John Logie Baird developed TV
   407	     in 1925).  Joyce explains how "the bairdboard bombardment
   408	     screen," the TV as receiver, receives the composite video
   409	     signal "in scynopanc pulses" (the synchronization pulses
   410	     that form part of the composite video signal), that come
   411	     down the "photoslope" on the "carnier walve" (i.e., the
   412	     carrier wave which carries the composite video signal) "with
   413	     the bitts bugtwug their teffs."  Joyce imagines this
   414	     receiver to be a "light barricade" against which the charge
   415	     of the light brigade (the video signal) is directed,
   416	     reproducing the "bitts."  Although (at least to my
   417	     knowledge) bit was not used as a technical term in
   418	     communication technology at the time, Joyce is still able,
   419	     on analogy with the telegraph, to think of the electrons or
   420	     photons as bits of information creating the TV picture.
   421	[16]      Speech, print and writing are interwoven with
   422	     electromechanical technologies of communication throughout
   423	     the _Wake_.  References to the manufacture of books,
   424	     newspapers and other products of the printing press abound.
   425	     Machineries and technological organizations accompany this
   426	     development: reporters, editors, interviewers, newsboys, ad
   427	     men who produce "Abortisements" (181.33).  Since complex
   428	     communication technology is characteristic of the later
   429	     stages, in addition to newspapers, radio, "dupenny"
   430	     magazines, comics (contemporary cave drawing), there is "a
   431	     phantom city phaked by philm pholk," by those who would
   432	     "roll away the reel world."  Telecommunications materialize
   433	     again and again throughout the night of the _Wake_, where
   434	     "television kills telephony."
   435	[17]      The "tele-" prefix, betraying an element of futurology
   436	     in the dream, appears in well over a dozen words including
   437	     in addition to the familiar forms terms such as "teleframe,"
   438	     "telekinesis," "telesmell," "telesphorously," "televisible,"
   439	     "televox," or "telewisher," while familiar forms also appear
   440	     in a variety of transformed "messes of mottage," such as
   441	     "velivision" and "dullaphone."  This complex verbal play all
   442	     hinges on the inter-translatability of the emerging forms of
   443	     technologically mediated communication.  In the opening
   444	     episode of the second part, the "Feenicht's Playhouse," an
   445	     imaginary play produced by HCE's children in their nursery
   446	     is "wordloosed over seven seas crowdblast in
   447	     cellelleneteutoslavzendlatinsoundscript.  In four
   448	     tubbloids" (219.28-9).  Like the cinema, "wordloosed"
   449	     (wirelessed but also let loose) transglobally, all such
   450	     media are engaged in a "crowdblast" of existing languages
   451	     and cultures, producing an interplay between local cultures
   452	     and a pan-international hyperculture.
   453	[18]      In the concluding moments of the _Wake_, Joyce
   454	     generalizes his pre-cybernetic vision in one long intricate
   455	     performance that not only concerns the book itself, but also
   456	     anticipates by twenty years some major discussions of
   457	     culture, communication, and technology.  A brief scene
   458	     setting: this is the moment in the closing episode just as
   459	     the HCE is awakening.  In the background he hears noises
   460	     from the machines in the laundry next door.  It is breakfast
   461	     time and there are sounds of food being prepared; eggs are
   462	     being cooked and will be eaten, so there is anticipation of
   463	     the process of digestion that is about to take place.^25^
   464	     At this moment a key passage, inviting interminable
   465	     interpretation, presents in very abstract language a
   466	     generalized model of production and consumption, which is
   467	     also the recorso of the schema of this nocturnal poem, that
   468	     consumes and produces, just as the digestive system itself
   469	     digests and produces new cells and excrement--how else could
   470	     one be a poet of "litters" as well as letters and be
   471	     "litterery" (114.17; 422.35) as well as literary?
   472	[19]      The passage begins by speaking about "our wholemole
   473	     millwheeling vicociclometer, a tetradomational
   474	     gazebocroticon," which may be the book, a letter to be
   475	     written, the digestive system assimilating the eggs, the
   476	     sexual process, the mechanical "mannormillor
   477	     clipperclappers" (614.13) of the nearby Mannor Millor
   478	     laundry, the temporal movement of history, or a theory of
   479	     engineering, for essentially it relates the production of
   480	     cultural artifacts or the consumption of matter (like
   481	     reading a book, seeing a film or eating eggs; the text
   482	     mentions a "farmer, his son and their homely codes, known as
   483	     eggburst, eggblend, eggburial, and hatch-as-hatch-can"
   484	     (614.28)).  The passage concludes, "as sure as herself
   485	     pits hen to paper and there's scribings scrawled on eggs"
   486	     (615.9-10).  Here the frequent pairing of speaking
   487	     (writing) with eating is brought to a climax in which it is
   488	     related to all the abstract machines which shape the life of
   489	     nature, decomposing into "bits" and recombining.
   490	[20]      These bits, described as "the dialytically [dialectic +
   491	     dialysis] separated elements of precedent decomposition,"
   492	     may be eggs, or other "homely codes" such as the
   493	     "heroticisms, catastrophes and ec-centricities" (the stuff
   494	     of history or the dreamers stuttering speech or his
   495	     staggering movements) transmitted elementally, "type by
   496	     tope, letter from litter, word at ward, sendence of sundance
   497	     . . ." (614.33-615.2).  All of these bits--matter, eggs,
   498	     words, TV signals, concepts, what you will--are
   499	     "anastomosically assimilated and preteri-dentified
   500	     paraidiotically," producing "the sameold gamebold adomic
   501	     structure . . . as highly charged with electrons as
   502	     hophazards can effective it" (615.5-8).  In anticipation of
   503	     the contemporary electronic definition of the "bit," Joyce
   504	     associates the structure of communication (ranging from TV
   505	     and telegraphic signals to morphophonemic information and
   506	     kinesthesia) with bits of signals, "data" and information.
   507	     He presents it as essentially an assemblage of
   508	     multiplicities, different from a synthesizing or totalizing
   509	     moment, for it occurs by the crossing of pluralistic
   510	     branches of differing motifs, through a process of
   511	     transmission involving flows, particularly the flowing of
   512	     blood, water and speech, and breaks such as the
   513	     discontinuous charges of electrical energy, telegraphy, and
   514	     punctuation--those "endspeaking nots for yestures" (267.8).
   515	[21]      Here Joyce's entire prophetic, schizoid vision of
   516	     cyberspace seems somewhat Deleuzian.  It is an ambivalent
   517	     and critical vision, for the "ambiviolence" of the
   518	     "langdwage" throughout the _Wake_ implies critique as it
   519	     unfolds this history, since Joyce still situates parody
   520	     within satire.  He does not free it from socio-political
   521	     reference, as a free-floating "postmodernist" play with the
   522	     surface of signifiers would.  This can be noted in the way
   523	     that Joyce first probes what came to be one of the keystones
   524	     of McLuhanism.  Joyce plays throughout the work with spheres
   525	     and circles, some of which parody one of the mystical
   526	     definitions of God frequently attributed to Alan of Lille
   527	     (Alanus de Insulis), but sometimes referred to as Pascal's
   528	     sphere.  Speaking of a daughter-goddess figure, he says:
   529	          our Frivulteeny Sexuagesima to expense herselfs as
   530	          sphere as possible, paradismic perimutter, in all
   531	          directions on the bend of the unbridalled, the
   532	          infinisissimalls of her facets becoming manier and
   533	          manier as the calicolum of her umdescribables (one has
   534	          thoughts of that eternal Rome) . . . .  (298.27-33)
   535	     Here a sphere is imagined whose center is everywhere and
   536	     circumference nowhere, since it is infinitesimal and
   537	     undescribable (though apparently the paradigmic perimeter is
   538	     sexual), as the paradisal mother communicates herself
   539	     without apparent limit.  This is both an embodied and a
   540	     disembodied sphere, polarizing and decentering the image so
   541	     as to impede any closure.  The same spherical principle is
   542	     applied more widely to the presentation of the sense of
   543	     hearing.  The reception of messages by the hero/ine of the
   544	     _Wake_, "(Hear! Calls! Everywhair!)" (108.23), is
   545	     accomplished by "bawling the whowle hamshack and wobble down
   546	     in an eliminium sounds pound so as to serve him up a
   547	     melegoturny marygoraumd" (309.22-4), a sphere for it
   548	     requires "a gain control of circumcentric megacycles"
   549	     (310.7-8).  It can truly be said of HCE, "Ear! Ear! Weakear!
   550	     An allness eversides!" (568.26),^26^ precisely because he is
   551	     "%h%uman, %e%rring and %c%ondonable"(58.19), yet "humile,
   552	     commune and ensectuous" (29.30), suffering many deprivations
   553	     his "%h%ardest %c%rux %e%ver" (623.33) [italics mine].
   554	     Though "humbly to fall and cheaply to rise, [this]
   555	     exposition of failures" (589.17) living with "%H%einz %c%ans
   556	     %e%verywhere"(581.5), still protests his fate "making use of
   557	     sacrilegious languages to the defect that he would
   558	     %c%hallenge their %h%emosphores to %e%xterminate them"
   559	     (81.25) by decentering or dislocating any attempts to
   560	     enclose him.
   561	[22]      This discussion of sphere and hearing critically
   562	     anticipates what McLuhan later called "acoustic space"--a
   563	     fundamental cyberspatial conception with its creation of
   564	     multi-dimensional environments, a spherical environment
   565	     within which aural information is received by the CNS--that
   566	     also embodies a transformation of the hermetic poetic
   567	     insight that "the universe (or nature) [or in earlier
   568	     versions, God] is an infinite sphere, the center of which is
   569	     everywhere, the circumference nowhere."^27^  Today, VR, as
   570	     Borges' treatment of Pascal's sphere seems to imply, is
   571	     coming to be our contemporary pre-millennial epitome of this
   572	     symbol, a place where each participant (rather than *the*
   573	     deity), as microcosm, is potentially the enigmatic center.
   574	     People englobed within virtual worlds find themselves
   575	     interacting within complex, transverse, intertextual
   576	     multimedia forms that are interlinked globally through
   577	     complex, rhizomic (root-like) networks.
   578	[23]      All of this must necessarily relate back to the way
   579	     Joyce treats the subject of and produces the artifact that
   580	     is *the book*.  While, beginning with Mallarme, the themes
   581	     of the book and the death of literature resound through
   582	     modernism, Joyce's transformation of the book filtered
   583	     through the "mcluhanitic" reaction to "mcluhanism" becomes,
   584	     in the usual interpretation of McLuhan, the annunciation of
   585	     the death of the book, *not* its transformation, as with
   586	     Joyce.  Joyce is important, for following Marcel Jousse and
   587	     Vico,^28^ he situates speech and writing as modes of
   588	     communication within a far richer and more complex bodily
   589	     and gestural theory of communication than that represented
   590	     by the reductive dichotomy of the oral and the literate.  As
   591	     the predominance of print declines, the _Wake_ explores the
   592	     history of communication by comically assimilating the
   593	     method of Vico's _The New Science_--which, as one of the
   594	     first systematic and empirical studies of the place of
   595	     poetic action in the history of how people develop systems
   596	     of signs and symbols, attributes people's ability for
   597	     constructing their society to the poetic function.
   598	[24]      Joyce avoids that facile over-simplification of the
   599	     complexities of print, arising from the orality/literacy
   600	     dichotomy, which attributes a privileged role to language as
   601	     verbal--a privilege based on theological and metaphysical
   602	     claims.  The same dichotomy creates problems in discussing
   603	     technological and other non-verbal forms of mediated
   604	     communication, including VR and TV.  At one point in the
   605	     _Wake_ "Television kills telephony in brothers' broil.  Our
   606	     eyes demand their turn.  Let them be seen!" (52.18-9), for
   607	     TV also comprehends the visual and the kinesthetic.  Yet
   608	     most McLuhanites who have opted for the orality/literacy
   609	     split still call it an oral medium in opposition to print.
   610	     The same problem occurs when mime, with its dependence on
   611	     gesture and rhythm, is analyzed as an oral medium.  As the
   612	     _Wake_ jocularly observes:
   613	          seein as ow his thoughts consisted chiefly of the
   614	          cheerio, he aptly sketched for our soontobe second
   615	          parents . . . the touching seene.  The solence of that
   616	          stilling!  Here one might a fin fell.  Boomster
   617	          rombombonant!  It scenes like a landescape from Wildu
   618	          Picturescu or some seem on some dimb Arras, dumb as
   619	          Mum's mutyness, this mimage . . . is odable to os
   620	          across the wineless Ere no dor nor mere eerie nor liss
   621	          potent of suggestion than in the tales of the
   622	          tingmount.  (52.34-53.6)
   623	     The mime plays with silence, sight, touch and movement
   624	     seeming like a landscape or a movie.
   625	[25]      Facile over-simplification also overlooks that long
   626	     before the beginnings of the trend towards cyberspace, print
   627	     had not been strictly oriented towards linearity and
   628	     writing, for the print medium was supplemented by its
   629	     encyclopedic, multi-media nature, absorbing other media such
   630	     as illustrations, charts, graphs, maps, diagrams, and
   631	     tables, not all aspects of which are precisely linear.
   632	     While writing may have had a predominantly linear tendency,
   633	     its history is far more complex, as Elizabeth Eisenstein has
   634	     established.^29^  The orality/literacy distinction does not
   635	     provide an adequately rich concept for dealing with print,
   636	     any more than it does for the most complex and comprehensive
   637	     images of virtual reality and participatory hyperspace
   638	     (e.g., sophisticated extensions of the datagloves or the
   639	     Aspen map), which, to adapt a Joycean phrase, directly
   640	     transmit "feelful thinkamalinks."  Since VR should enable a
   641	     person to feel the bodily set of another person or place,
   642	     while simultaneously receiving multiple intersensory
   643	     messages, understanding the role of the body in
   644	     communication is crucial for understanding VR.  When McLuhan
   645	     and Edward Carpenter first spoke about their concept of
   646	     orality (linked to aurality, mouth to ear, as line of print
   647	     to eye scan), it entailed recognizing the priority and
   648	     primacy of tactility and inter-sensory activity in
   649	     communication, for "In the beginning there was the gest."
   650	[26]      As Kenneth Burke realized in the 30s, Joyce's grounding
   651	     communication and language in gesture is distinctly
   652	     different from an approach which privileges language, for it
   653	     involves a complete embodying of communication.  While the
   654	     oral only embodies the speech organs, the entire CNS is
   655	     necessarily involved in all communication, including speech.
   656	     As John Bishop has shown in _Joyce's Book of the Dark_, the
   657	     sleeper primarily receives sensations with his ear, but
   658	     these are tranformed within the body into the world of signs
   659	     that permeate the dream and which constitute the _Wake_.^30^
   660	     Joyce views language as "gest," as an imaginary means of
   661	     embodying intellectual-emotional complexes, his "feelful
   662	     thinkamalinks."  From this perspective, the semic units of
   663	     the _Wake_ (integrated complexes constructed from the
   664	     interaction of speech and print involving, rhythm,
   665	     orthography as sign and gesture and visual image) assume the
   666	     role of dialogue with other modes of mediated communication,
   667	     exploiting their limitations and differences.  Joyce crafts
   668	     a new %lingua% for a world where the poetic book will deal
   669	     with those aspects of the imaginary that cannot be
   670	     encompassed within technologically mediated communication.
   671	     Simultaneously, he recognizes that a trend towards virtual
   672	     reality is characteristic of the electro-mechanically or
   673	     technologically mediated modes of communication.  This
   674	     process posits a continuous dialogue in which _Ulysses_ and
   675	     the _Wake_ were designed to play key roles.
   676	[27]      As Joyce--who quipped that "some of the means I use are
   677	     trivial--and some are quadrivial"^31^--was aware, ancient
   678	     rhetorical theory (which he parodied both in the Aeolus
   679	     episode of _Ulysses_ and in the "Triv and Quad" section (II,
   680	     2) of the _Wake_) also included those interactive contexts
   681	     where the body was an intrinsic part of communication.
   682	     Delivery involved controlling the body, and the context
   683	     within which it was presented, as well as the voice.  The
   684	     actual rhetorical action (particularly in judicial oratory)
   685	     also frequently involved demonstration and witnesses.  This
   686	     analysis, closer to the pre-literate, recognized the way
   687	     actual communication integrated oral, visual, rhythmical,
   688	     gestural and kinesthetic components.  Recent research into
   689	     the classical and medieval "arts of memory," inspired by
   690	     Frances Yates,^32^ have demonstrated that memory involves
   691	     the body, a sense of the dramatic and theatrical, visual
   692	     icons and movement, as well as the associative power of the
   693	     oral itself.  Joyce playfully invokes this memory system
   694	     familiar to him from his Jesuit education: "After sound,
   695	     light and heat, memory, will and understanding.  Here (the
   696	     memories framed from walls are minding) till wranglers for
   697	     wringwrowdy wready are . . ." (266.18-22).  A classical
   698	     world, which recognized such features of the communicative
   699	     process, could readily speak about the poem as a "speaking
   700	     picture" and the painting as "silent poetry."  Here, there
   701	     is an inclusiveness of the means available rather than a
   702	     dependency on a single channel of communication.
   703	[28]      Joyce was so intrigued by the potentials of the new
   704	     culture of time and space for reconstructing and
   705	     revolutionizing the book that he claimed himself to be "the
   706	     greatest engineer," as well as a Renaissance man, who was
   707	     also a "musicmaker, a philosophist and heaps of other
   708	     things."^33^  The mosaic of the _Wake_ contributes to
   709	     understanding the nature of cyberspace by grasping the
   710	     radical constitution of the electronic cosmos that Joyce
   711	     called "the chaosmos of Alle" (118.21).  In this "chaosmos,"
   712	     engineered by a sense of interactive mnemotechnics, he
   713	     intuits the relation between a nearly infinite quantity of
   714	     cultural information and the mechanical yet rhizomic
   715	     organization of a network, "the matrix," which underlies the
   716	     construction of imaginary and virtual worlds.  One crucial
   717	     reason for raising the historic image of Joyce in a
   718	     discussion of cyberspace is that he carries out one of the
   719	     most comprehensive contemporary discussions of virtual
   720	     recollection (a concept first articulated by Henri Bergson
   721	     as virtual memory).^34^  In counterpoint to the emerging
   722	     technological capability to create the "virtual reality" of
   723	     cyberspace, Joyce turned to dream and hallucination for the
   724	     creation of virtual worlds within natural language.
   725	[29]      That tactile, gestural-based dreamworld has built-in
   726	     mnemonic systems:
   727	          A scene at sight.  Or dreamoneire.  Which they shall
   728	          memorise.  By her freewritten.  Hopely for ear that
   729	          annalykeses if scares for eye that sumns.  Is it in the
   730	          now woodwordings of our sweet plantation where the
   731	          branchings then will singingsing tomorrows gone and
   732	          yesters outcome . . . .   (280.01-07)
   733	     Joyce's virtual worlds began with the recognition of
   734	     "everybody" as a poet (each person is co-producer; he quips,
   735	     "his producers are they not his consumers?").  All culture
   736	     becomes the panorama of his dream; the purpose of poetic
   737	     writing in a post-electric world is the painting of that
   738	     interior (which is not the psychoanalytic, but the social
   739	     unconscious) and the providing of new language appropriate
   740	     to perceiving the complexities of the new world of
   741	     technologically reproducible media:
   742	          What has gone?  How it ends?
   743	          Begin to forget it.  It will remember itself from every
   744	          sides, with all gestures, in each our word.  Today's
   745	          truth, tomorrow's trend.  (614.19-21)
   746	     Joyce's text is embodied in gesture, enclosed in words,
   747	     enmeshed in time, and engaged in foretelling "Today's truth.
   748	     Tomorrow's trend."  The poet reproducing his producers is
   749	     the divining prophet.
   750	[30]      If speaking of Joyce and cyberspace seems to imply a
   751	     kind of futurology, the whole of McLuhan's project was
   752	     frequently treated as prophesying the emergence of a new
   753	     tribalized global society--the global village, itself
   754	     anticipated by Joyce's "international" language of
   755	     multilingual puns.  In fact, in _War and Peace in the Global
   756	     Village_, McLuhan uses Wakese (mostly from Joyce, freely
   757	     associated) as marginalia.  McLuhan flourished in his role
   758	     as an international guru by casting himself in the role of
   759	     "*the* prime prophet" announcing the coming of a new era of
   760	     communication^35^ (now talked about as virtual reality or
   761	     cyberspace, though he never actually used that word).  The
   762	     prime source of his "prophecies," which he never concealed,
   763	     is to be found in Joyce and Vico.^36^  The entire Joycean
   764	     dream is prophetic or divinatory in part, for the
   765	     anticipated awakening (Vico's fourth age of ricorso
   766	     following birth, marriage, and death) is "providential
   767	     divining":
   768	          Ere we are!  Signifying, if tungs may tolkan, that,
   769	          primeval conditions having gradually receded but
   770	          nevertheless the emplacement of solid and fluid having
   771	          to a great extent persisted through intermittences of
   772	          sullemn fulminance, sollemn nuptialism, sallemn
   773	          sepulture and providential divining, making possible
   774	          and even inevitable, after his a time has a tense haves
   775	          and havenots hesitency, at the place and period under
   776	          consideration a socially organic entity of a millenary
   777	          military maritory monetary morphological
   778	          circumformation in a more or less settled state of
   779	          equonomic ecolube equalobe equilab equilibbrium.
   780	          (599.8-18)
   781	     Earlier, it is said of the dreamer that "He caun ne'er be
   782	     bothered but maun e'er be waked.  If there is a future in
   783	     every past that is present . . ." (496.34-497.1).  Joyce,
   784	     from whom McLuhan derived the idea, is playing with the
   785	     medieval concept of natural prophecy, making it a
   786	     fundamental feature of the epistemology of his dream world,
   787	     in which the "give and take" of the "mind factory," an
   788	     "antithesis of ambidual anticipation," generates auspices,
   789	     auguries, and divination--for "DIVINITY NOT DEITY [is] THE
   790	     UNCERTAINTY JUSTIFIED BY OUR CERTITUDE" (282.R7-R13).
   791	[31]      Natural prophecy, the medieval way of thinking about
   792	     futurology with which Joyce and McLuhan were naturally
   793	     familiar from scholasticism and Thomism, occurs through a
   794	     reading of history and its relation to that virtual,
   795	     momentary social text (the present), which is dynamic and
   796	     always undergoing change.  Joyce appears to blend this
   797	     medieval concept with classical sociological ideas--of
   798	     prophecy as an "intermediation"--quite consistent with his
   799	     concepts of communication as involving aspects of
   800	     participation and communion.  It is only through some such
   801	     reading that the future existent in history can be known and
   802	     come to be.  McLuhan's reading, adapted from Joyce, of the
   803	     collision of history and the present moment led him to
   804	     foresee a world emerging where communication would be
   805	     tactile, post-verbal, fully participatory and
   806	     pan-sensory.^37^
   807	[32]      Why ought communication history and theory take account
   808	     of Joyce's poetic project?  First, because he designed a new
   809	     language (later disseminated by McLuhan, Eco, and Derrida)
   810	     to carry out an in-depth interpretation of complex
   811	     socio-historical phenomenon, namely new modes of semiotic
   812	     production.  Two brief examples: Hollywood "wordloosing
   813	     celluloid soundscript over seven seas," or the products of
   814	     the Hollywood dream factory itself as "a rolling away of the
   815	     reel world," reveal media's potential international
   816	     domination as well as the problems film form raises for the
   817	     mutual claims of the imaginary and the real.  For example,
   818	     the term "abortisements" (advertisements) suggests the
   819	     manipulation of fetishized femininity with its submerged
   820	     relation of advertisement to butchering--the segmentation of
   821	     the body as object into an assemblage of parts.
   822	[33]      Second, Joyce's work is a critique of communication's
   823	     historical role in the production of culture, and it
   824	     constitutes one of the earliest recognitions of the
   825	     importance of Vico to a contemporary history of
   826	     communication and culture.^38^  Third, his work is itself
   827	     the first "in-depth" contemporary exploration of the
   828	     complexities of reading, writing, rewriting, speaking,
   829	     aurality, and orality.  Fourth, developing Vico's earlier
   830	     insights and anticipating Kenneth Burke, he sees the
   831	     importance of the "poetic" as a concept in communication,
   832	     for the poetic is the means of generating new communicative
   833	     potentials between medium and message.  This provides the
   834	     poetic, the arts, and other modes of cultural production
   835	     with a crucial role in a semiotic ecology of communication,
   836	     an ecology of sense, and making sense.  Fifth, in the
   837	     creative project of this practice, Joyce develops one of the
   838	     most complex discussions of the contemporary transformation
   839	     of our media of communication.  And finally, his own work is
   840	     itself an exemplum of the socio-ecological role of the
   841	     poetic in human communication.
   842	[34]      VR or cyberspace, as an assemblage of a multiplicity of
   843	     existing and new media, dramatizes the relativity of our
   844	     classifications of media and their effects.  The newly
   845	     evolving global metropolis arising in the age of cyberspace
   846	     is a site where people are intellectual nomads:
   847	     differentiation, difference, and decentering characterize
   848	     its structure.  Joyce and the arts of high modernism and
   849	     postmodernism provide a solid appreciation of how people
   850	     constantly reconstruct or remake reality through the
   851	     traversing of the multi-sensory fragments of a "virtual
   852	     world" and of the tremendous powers with which electricity
   853	     and the analysis of mechanization would endow the paramedia
   854	     that would eventually emerge.

   892	          ^9^  A further paper needs to be written on the way in
   893	     which synaesthesia as well as coenesthesia participate in
   894	     the pre-history of cyberspace.  The unfolding history of
   895	     poets and artists confronting electromechanical
   896	     technoculture, which begins in the 1850s, reveals a growing
   897	     interest in synesthesia and coenesthesia and parallels a
   898	     gradually accelerating yearning for artistic works which are
   899	     syntheses or orchestrations of the arts.  By 1857 Charles
   900	     Baudelaire intuited the future transformational power of the
   901	     coming of electro-communication when he established his
   902	     concept of synaesthesia and the trend toward a synthesis of
   903	     all the arts as central aspects of %symbolisme%.  The
   904	     transformational matrices involved in synaesthesia and the
   905	     synthesis of the arts unconsciously respond to that
   906	     digitalization implicit in Morse code and telegraphy,
   907	     anticipating how one of the major characteristics of
   908	     cyberspace will be the capability of all modes of expression
   909	     to be transformed into minimal discrete contrastive units--
   910	     bits.
   911	          This assertion concerning Baudelaire's use of
   912	     synesthesia is developed from Benjamin's discussions of
   913	     Baudelaire.  The role of shock in Baudelaire's poetry, which
   914	     links the "Correspondances" with "La Vie Anterieur," also
   915	     reflects how the modern fragmentation involved in "Le
   916	     Crepuscle du Soir" and "Le Crepuscle du Matin" is
   917	     reassembled poetically through the verbal transformation of
   918	     sensorial modes.  This is the beginning of a period in which
   919	     the strategy of using shock to deal with fragmentation is
   920	     transformed into seeing the multiplicity of codifications of
   921	     municipal (or urban) reality.  So when the metamorphic
   922	     sensory effects of nature's temple are applied to the
   923	     splenetic here and now, in the background is the emergence
   924	     of the new codifications of reality, such as the photography
   925	     which so preoccupied Baudelaire, and telegraphy, which had
   926	     an important impact in his lifetime.

   952	     A number of subsequent passages are adapted with minor
   953	     modifications from parts of the last article, which is a
   954	     fairly comprehensive coverage of Joyce and technology.
   955	
   956	          ^14^  While in one sense the dreamer is identified as
   957	     the male HCE, the book opens and closes with the feminine
   958	     voice of ALP.  It is her dream of his dreaming, or his dream
   959	     of her dreaming?  Essentially, it is androgynous, with a
   960	     mingling of male and female voices throughout.  For another
   961	     treatment of the male-female theme in the _Wake_, see
   962	     Suzette Henke, _James Joyce and the Politics of Desire_ (NY:
   963	     RKP, 1989).
   964	
   965	          ^15^  "Jousstly" refers to Marcel Jousse's important
   966	     work on communication and the semiotics of gesture, with
   967	     which Joyce was familiar.  See especially Lorraine Weir,
   968	     "The Choreography of Gesture: Marcel Jousse and _Finnegans
   969	     Wake_," _James Joyce Quarterly_, 14:3 (Spring 1977), 313-25.
   970	
   971	          ^16^  This motif will be developed further below.  It
   972	     relates to Joyce's interest in Lewis Carroll.  Gilles
   973	     Deleuze comments extensively on manducation in _The Logic of
   974	     Sense_, trans. Mark Lester with Charles Stivale, ed.

   981	          ^18^  Cf. T.S. Eliot, _Selected Essays_ (NY: Harcourt,
   982	     Brace, 1932), 182: "One of the surest of tests is the way in
   983	     which a poet borrows.  Immature poets imitate; mature poets
   984	     steal . . . "; see also "Old stone to new building, old
   985	     timber to new fires," ("East Coker," _Four Quartets_, l. 5).
   986	     Joyce's use of "outlex" relates to Jim the Penman, for Joyce
   987	     analyzing Shem in the _Wake_ is aware of how the traditions
   988	     of the artist as liar, counterfeiter, con man, and thief
   989	     could all coalesce about the role of the artist as an
   990	     outlaw.
   991	
   992	          ^19^  "Kills" in the sense of "to kill a bottle";
   993	     "kills" also as a stream or channel of water.

  1054	
  1055	          ^35^  Speaking of the all-embracing aspects of VR and
  1056	     cyberspace, the work which Baudrillard has made of
  1057	     "simulation" and "the ecstasy of communication" should be
  1058	     noted.  This issue is too complex to engage within an essay
  1059	     specifically focused on Joyce.  In approaching it, however,
  1060	     it is important to realize the degree of similarity that
  1061	     Baudrillard's treatment of communication shares with
  1062	     McLuhan's.  In many ways, I believe it could be established
  1063	     that what Baudrillard critiques as the "ecstasy of
  1064	     communication" is his understanding of McLuhan's vision of
  1065	     communication divorced from its historical roots in the
  1066	     literature and arts of %symbolisme%, high modernism, and
  1067	     particularly James Joyce.
  1068	
  1069	          ^36^  This is a major theme of McLuhan and McLuhan's

  1079	     Harper & Row, 1974), 28-38.  The significance of Vico's
  1080	     emphasis on the body is developed in John O'Neill, _Five
  1081	     Bodies: The Human Sense of Society_ (Ithaca, NY: Cornell UP,
