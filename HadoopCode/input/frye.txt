     3	Directory, the most powerful automatic hardware and software inventory
     4	program on the market. LAN Directory features a complete custom report
     5	writer, more information than any similar product, as well as integration
     6	with other Frye products under the Frye Utilities Management Platform.
     7	
     8	LAN Directory allows computer managers to track all of their PC's and
     9	MAC's, including stand-alone machines, file servers, printers, external
    10	disk drives, modems, software, and more. It provides managers with
    11	extensive details about the products installed on their networks and their
    12	configurations. A database is maintained that can be set for automatic or
    13	manual operation in updating LAN configurations, DOS versions, system
    14	configurations, user names, etc. LAN Directory can also be used to
    15	troubleshoot problems such as those caused by old or error-prone versions
    16	of hardware or software. Just run a change report or a version comparison
    17	report. In addition, it can be used for upgrade management, downtime
    18	reporting, maintenance, automated inventory reporting, etc. (more)
    19	
    20	LAN Directory is the latest of a set of integrated products from Frye for
    21	Novell NetWare users. These products give network managers complete
    22	control of their PC LAN's from a central management workstation. Frye will
    23	release more of these products during the coming months as part of its
    24	commitment to a high quality network environment.
    25	
    26	Inventories Hardware And Software 
    27	
    28	LAN workstations and file servers are automatically audited for hundreds of
    29	hardware and software elements. External devices can be inventoried
    30	manually. Standalone PCs can be inventoried automatically by running the
    31	software at each machine.
    32	
    33	Catalogs Hundreds of Items Per PC 
    34	
    35	LAN Directory gathers almost every detail possible for workstations and
    36	file servers. Nobody else has this level of detail, especially for NetWare
    37	3.1 + servers. LAN Directory even stores text start-up files such as
    38	AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS. If the information needed is not stored
    39	automatically, it can be added manually.
    40	
    41	Powerful Custom Reporting 
    42	
    43	Customized reports can be created using any number of items. Reports are
    44	also included that can be modified. Use multiple headers and footers. Move
    45	text around the screen and place titles and data areas anywhere to create
    46	wide, narrow or custom width reports.
    47	
    48	Automatic Operation 
    49	
    50	LAN workstation data is gathered automatically at each log-in. No TSRs are
    51	required.
    52

    56	advanced network management products for the new NetWare Management System
    57	platform. Frye is committed to integrating LAN Directory and other
    58	products into the new platform.

    61	the week of NetWorld and is priced at $495.

    64	
    65	BOSTON -- February 3, 1992 -- Frye Computer Systems, Inc., publisher of the
    66	award winning Frye Utilities for Networks, is participating with Novell in
    67	the development of advanced network management products for the new
    68	NetWare Management System platform which is being announced today by
    69	Novell, Inc. As a Gold level Novell Developer (Novell's highest category),
    70	Frye has been provided with NMS information for over a year.
    71	
    72	"Frye Computer Systems is proud to be participating with Novell in the
    73	development of advanced network management products for the new NetWare
    74	Management System platform," said Russell H. Frye, President of Frye
    75	Computer Systems, Inc. "We believe that the combination of the expertise
    76	demonstrated in the Frye Utilities along with the support provided by
    77	Novell's new system will produce a powerful partnership."
    78	
    79	IS NOVELL COMPETING WITH ITS OWN 3RD PARTY DEVELOPERS?
    80	
    81	Frye has been repeatedly asked if it considers Novell to be a competitor in
    82	the network management market and would like to take this opportunity to
    83	set the record straight. "During discussions of the $5,000 NMS platform
    84	and other management software projects, Novell has promised, time and time
    85	again, that it will not compete with Frye and similar developers." Mr.
    86	Frye continues to explain that "Novell has assured us that they will only
    87	provide a platform for development and a few specific applications that
    88	are not available from 3rd parties. They have said that they have no
    89	intention of copying existing products and features to provide similar
    90	products or features to those of their 3rd party developers."
    91	
    92	Novell has always sought to work in close cooperation with its 3rd party
    93	developers. Historically, it has benefitted enormously from the support
    94	provided by outside software and hardware firms that have made NetWare the
    95	most flexible network operating system in the industry. Due to its open
    96	architecture and generous support for developers, end-users can take
    97	advantage of a myriad of options to satisfy their network needs. Novell
    98	appears to wish to maintain its successful heritage.
    99	
   100	FRYE AND NMS
   101	
   102	Frye plans to release many of its functions in ports to the NMS platform,
   103	in both Microsoft Windows and IBM OS/2 form. Novell has provided
   104	developers with hooks for many sets of data that can be used by their
   105	applications. Frye can supply its industry leading notification and
   106	response options (from the NetWare Early Warning System) for monitoring
   107	purposes, as well as its extensive workstation and file server support
   108	software (from NetWare Management and LAN Directory.) Look for several
   109	major announcements in coordination with Novell during the coming months.
   110
