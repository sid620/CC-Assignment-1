    17	  TITLE:
    18	      The STACKER device driver's memory requirements.
    19	
    20	  OVERVIEW:
    21	      The STACKER device driver is a resident program.  It loads from the
    22	      CONFIG.SYS file at boot-time, mounts the compressed STACKER volumes, then
    23	      shrinks down and remains in RAM until powered off.
    24	
    25	      Starting sizes in bytes, without STACKER cache (/M=0)
    26	
    27	                                  Coprocessor             Software
    28	                                    Version               Version
    29	
    30	      1st volume  (with 4KB clusters):21,504                30,720
    31	                  (with 8KB clusters):25,600                38,912
    32	                      add'l volumes:   3,072 each            3,072 each
    33	
    34	      When STACKER loads at boot time, the size of the driver (both initial and
    35	      resident) is displayed.
    36	
    37	  ISSUES/COMMENTS:
    38	      1) The amount of memory used by STACKER may prevent the launching of
    39	      programs which ran properly before STACKER was installed.  "Insufficient
    40	      memory" messages may result.
    41	
    42	      2) When loading both the driver and the STACKER cache into high memory,
    43	      there may not be a sufficiently large contiguous block of memory.  This
    44	      may result in an error message from the memory manager and failure to
    45	      load the driver high.
    46	
    47	      3) In the coprocessor version, 9 Kbytes are allocated for internal
    48	      buffers by default.
    49	
    50	  RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
    51	      1) If the STACKER cache has been specified, try lowering the /M=xx switch
    52	      in the "DEVICE=C:\STACKER\STACKER.COM..." line for a smaller cache (see
    53	      User's Manual, "STACKER Utilites/Commands").  If errors persist even with
    54	      the driver as small as possible, use a memory manager to load the STACKER
    55	      driver (and cache, if present) into high memory.
    56	
    57	      2) Lower the size of the STACKER cache, as in (1), until the driver fits
    58	      into high memory.  Most memory managers include a utility for optimizing
    59	      the organization of device drivers; optimizing high memory may allow the
    60	      STACKER driver and cache to fit better.
    61	
    62	      3) To free up the 9 Kbytes of internal buffers, insert an /M=0 switch to
    63	      the STACKER device driver line in CONFIG.SYS, as in (1).
