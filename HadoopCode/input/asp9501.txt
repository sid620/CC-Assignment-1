   594	                              How to read this catalog
   595	
   596	          ASP members have supplied product descriptions for each shareware
   597	          application they offer.  The catalog groups them by subject
   598	          matter and lists them alphabetically.  If you want to know the
   599	          name/address/phone for the author of a particular program, turn
   600	          to the index and look for the program by name.  You'll usually
   601	          see two page references: one describes the page where you read
   602	          about the program, the other mentions the page where you can find
   603	          information about the author (in Appendix A).  Just turn to the
   604	          appropriate page and scan for the name of the program.
   605	
   606	          The Association of Shareware Professionals does NOT rate members'
   607	          software for functionality or usefulness, nor can it attest to
   608	          the validity of any product description in this catalog.  That is
   609	          for you - the user - to decide.  Shareware, especially those
   610	          products authorized to carry the ASP logo, can be tested on a
   611	          "try before you buy" basis.  If the software doesn't meet your
   612	          needs, you won't have to worry about getting a refund.  (That's
   613	          the beauty of the shareware marketing concept.)
   614	
   615	
   616	          1.1  Minimum requirements
   617	
   618	          Every program description lists its computer and operating system
   619	          requirements (e.g. "IBM PC, DOS 2.0 or better").  Unless noted
   620	          otherwise, each program assumes you have a standard keyboard,
   621	          monitor, printer, and either two floppy drives or a hard disk.
   622	          And unless noted otherwise, programs written for the IBM PC
   623	          assume you have at least 512k of total installed RAM.  Many pro-
   624	          grams may also need specific hardware or software such as:
   625	             CD-ROM drive
   626	                         A device capable of reading CD-ROMs.  A CD-ROM
   627	                         looks just like a regular compact disk with music
   628	                         on it, but it has information on it only a
   629	                         computer's CD-ROM drive can read.
   630	             CGA monitor A video monitor capable of displaying CGA
   631	                         graphics.  This includes most "laptop CGA"
   632	                         computers, plus higher resolution monitors such as
   633	                         the EGA or VGA.  Some (but not all) of the
   634	                         described programs may operate correctly with a
   635	                         Hercules monitor if you use a "CGA simulator"
   636	                         program; consult your video monitor manual for
   637	                         details.
   638	             Dual 720k disk drives
   639	                         At least two floppy drives capable of writing at
   640	                         least 720k of data per disk, or, preferably, a
   641	                         hard disk (see below).

   645	
   646	
   647	             EGA monitor A video monitor capable of displaying EGA
   648	                         graphics.  This almost always includes VGA and
   649	                         other higher-resolution monitors.  CGA and
   650	                         Hercules monitors won't suffice.
   651	             EMS memory  Memory accessible via the Lotus-Intel-Microsoft
   652	                         Expanded Memory Specification.  Not to be confused
   653	                         with expanded memory, extended memory, or XMS
   654	                         memory (see below).  Windows, OS/2, and newer
   655	                         versions of DOS come with software designed to
   656	                         implement EMS memory on computers with enough
   657	                         installed memory.
   658	             Epson printer
   659	                         A printer capable of recognizing the Epson print
   660	                         command set (an industry standard).  Some
   661	                         printers, including some laser printers, have
   662	                         options to behave like an Epson printer.  Some
   663	                         programs may require a specific model such as the
   664	                         Epson MX-80 or FX-100.
   665	             Hard disk   A fixed-, removable-, or network-drive device
   666	                         capable of storing multiple megabytes of data.
   667	                         Some programs also assume you have at least one
   668	                         floppy drive in addition to the hard disk.
   669	             Hercules monitor
   670	                         A video monitor capable of displaying Hercules
   671	                         graphics.  CGA, EGA, VGA, & SVGA monitors won't
   672	                         suffice.
   673	             HP DeskJet  A Hewlett-Packard DeskJet or compatible printer.
   674	                         Some programs may require a DeskJet starting with
   675	                         a specific model such as the DeskJet Plus or
   676	                         having a specific feature like a RAM cartridge.
   677	             HP LaserJet A Hewlett-Packard LaserJet or compatible printer.
   678	                         (HP DeskJet printers recognize most, but not all,
   679	                         of the HP LaserJet command set.)  Some programs
   680	                         may require a specific model such as the LaserJet
   681	                         II or with a specific feature like the LaserJet
   682	                         IIIDSi.
   683	             Math coprocessor
   684	                         An IBM PC or compatible computer with an installed
   685	                         math coprocessor unit.  Commonly referred to as an
   686	                         "80x87 chip," these include the 8087, 80287, and
   687	                         80387 coprocessors.  (80486- and Pentium-based
   688	                         computers have math coprocessors by default.)
   689	                         Most 8086-, 80286-, and 80386-based IBM PCs &
   690	                         compatibles have no installed math coprocessor by
   691	                         default.  (80286- and 80386-based computers can
   692	                         accept a math coprocessor if you purchase one.)
   693	             Modem       A modem.  Almost all programs work with a "Hayes
   694	                         compatible" modem, specifically one able to
   695	                         recognize the Hayes command set (an industry
   696	                         standard).  A few programs claim to work with non-
   697	                         Hayes modems too.  Some programs may require the
   698	                         modem to operate at a specific rate of speed (e.g.
   699	                         "1200 baud").
   700	             Mouse       A Logitec- or Microsoft-compatible mouse.

   707	                         Program descriptions will normally specify the
   708	                         different types of LAN systems under which they
   709	                         can operate.
   710	             Plotter     A plotter output device.  Many of the described

   715	                         command set.  Many printers (including the HP
   716	                         LaserJet series) offer PostScript compatibility
   717	                         via plug-in cartridges.  Software also exists to
   718	                         emulate PostScript on hundreds of popular
   719	                         printers.

   730	                         information only a computer can read.  Common
   731	                         streaming tapes include DC600, DC2000, DC2120;

   741	                         versions of DOS come with software designed to
   742	                         implement XMS memory on computers with enough

   746	          1.2  Registration benefits
   747	
   748	          All ASP member shareware products come with certain minimum
   749	          benefits when you register.  The author must acknowledge your
   750	          registration (you don't just get a canceled check) and must
   751	          provide a minimum amount of technical support for at least three
   752	          months.
   753	
   754	          Many authors provide other registration benefits such as a
   755	          printed manual, a master disk, a year of unlimited phone support,
   756	          source code, etc.  The product description will mention them when
   757	          appropriate.

   763	          In addition, every ASP member can offer the following benefits to
   764	          registered customers:

   769	                         register an ASP member's shareware product.
   770	
   771	          Many authors include this information when they acknowledge
   772	          registrations.  Contact the author if you need assistance.
   773	
   774	          Some authors add "registration reminder screens" to the shareware
   775	          version of a program as a way to gently remind people to
   776	          register.  (The ASP sets ethical standards regarding it.)  Almost
   777	          all authors will either send a copy of the program without
   778	          reminder screens, or will disclose a method to disable the
   779	          reminders, once you register the product.

   784	          This sample description will help you understand what each field
   785	          means:

   788	            A "[***]" across from the product name indicates a new or
   789	            updated description since the last catalog.
   790	          Author:  name & phone number of the person or company offering
   791	            this product.  See Appendix A for detailed information about
   792	            the person or company.
   793	          Version:  version number  (release date)
   794	          Needs:  computer type [IBM PC, IBM 80386, Macintosh, etc.],
   795	            operating system, and version number.  May also describe other
   796	            needed or recommended hardware & software.  See above for more
   797	            details.
   798	          Registration fee:  The cost of a single user license, expressed
   799	            in U.S. currency unless otherwise noted.  Many authors provide
   800	            "multi-tier" registrations, and you may pay a little more or
   801	            less than the amount stated here depending on your situation.
   802	            (You can often save money by "reading the fine print.")  Some
   803	            authors include shipping & handling fees in the prices while
   804	            others don't.  Most authors offer network, site, and corporate
   805	            licenses for a higher fee; please contact the author in
   806	            question for details and price quotes.

   838	          Special instructions:  tells if the author limits product
   839	            distribution to the United States.  In some cases the author or
   840	            company may have signed a contract forbidding worldwide share-
   841	            ware distribution.  In other cases the product may only appeal
   842	            to an American audience (income tax software for example).  In
   843	            rare cases, U.S. federal laws may actually prohibit the author
   844	            or company from distributing the product in other countries.
   845	          Editor's note:  the catalog editor may append text of his own if
   846	            something needs further explanation.
   847	          Description:  a paragraph or two of text which describes the
   848	            shareware product in detail.  This information comes direct
   849	            from the author or company behind the program.

  9653	            A virus detection system that protects your computer from virus
  9654	            attack by alerting you to unexpected changes in your executable
  9655	            files or boot record.  Unlike other CRC-based utilities, this
  9656	            uses a sophisticated message digest algorithm that cannot be
  9657	            inverted. FileSafe can detect any changes no matter how well
  9658	            covered. FileSafe is easy to use, unobtrusive, takes up little
  9659	            space and comes with a comprehensive users manual that
  9660	            discusses viruses and strategies for using FileSafe.

 11549	            Helps improve your writing style in two ways. First, it
 11550	            examines your writing for common problems, such as redundant
 11551	            words, wordy phrases, and awkward sentence structure. Second,
 11552	            it analyzes your writing style and presents statistics that
 11553	            tell you where your writing is weak and where it is strong.
 11554	            Although it is not a substitute for an independent review, it
 11555	            can help you to write more clearly and directly and avoid
 11556	            common writing-style errors.

 32963	          Description:
 32964	            No one really knows when PEG solitaire was invented. Some
 32965	            stories trace it to prisoners during the French Revolution, but
 32966	            published descriptions date at least 100 years earlier.  Most
 32967	            likely the game is even older.  This presents variations on the
 32968	            classic peg solitaire with multiple starting positions, and
 32969	            varying endgames.  One of the pleasures of playing the game on
 32970	            your computer is that you can quickly set up the board to try
 32971	            different strategies. Ages 8 to 88.

 34180	
 34181	
 34182	          18.1  Assn. Shareware Professionals
 34183	
 34184	            The Association of Shareware Professionals (ASP) formed in 1987
 34185	            to strengthen the future of shareware as an alternative to
 34186	            traditional (retail) software marketing.  It also serves as an
 34187	            information clearing house for its members and the public at
 34188	            large.  ASP members subscribe to a code of ethics and are
 34189	            committed to the shareware concept.
 34190	
 34191	            The ASP demands professionalism from its members.  Authors must
 34192	            acknowledge every registration (you get more than just a
 34193	            canceled check) and they must provide at least three months of
 34194	            support for their products.  ASP members must also live up to
 34195	            any other benefits they offer.
 34196	
 34197	            You can turn to an ombudsman for help if you can't resolve a
 34198	            problem with an ASP author or disk vendor.  Members must
 34199	            explain this in every shareware program & disk vendor catalog.
 34200	
 34201	            Few people need the ombudsman's help.  ASP members represent
 34202	            the cream of the crop in the shareware industry, but it's nice
 34203	            to know you can turn to someone if you think you got a raw
 34204	            deal.  Unfortunately, it happens - authors have been kicked out
 34205	            because of repeated complaints.
 34206	
 34207	            The Association monitors Congress for potentially damaging
 34208	            legislation and has sent spokesmen to testify before
 34209	            congressional subcommittees.  It has also taken on the respon-
 34210	            sibility of safeguarding the term 'shareware' itself.  ASP has
 34211	            filed motions in countries as far away as England and South
 34212	            Africa to stop people who attempt to claim it as a trademark
 34213	            word.
 34214	
 34215	            ASP members 'meet' online in a public forum of the CompuServe
 34216	            network (GO SHAREWARE).  Members send & receive messages,
 34217	            transmit files, and exchange valuable information.  Old hands
 34218	            in the shareware business pass along their insights to new
 34219	            members.  The group holds public and private debates and
 34220	            members vote on major issues by sending private messages to the
 34221	            Association secretary.
 34222	
 34223	            The ASP holds yearly 'face to face' meetings and appears at
 34224	            various trade shows around the country (including COMDEX and
 34225	            PC-EXPO).  It also provides speakers who lecture on every
 34226	            aspect of shareware.  You can learn more by writing to the
 34227	            Association of Shareware Professionals, 545 Grover Road,

 40825	
 40826	            This appendix lists shareware products now "retired" by the
 40827	            author.  Retired products no longer receive the minimum levels
 40828	            of support, and the authors have agreed to return any registra-
 40829	            tion fees sent in for the software.
 40830	
 40831	            An author may retire a shareware product for any number of
 40832	            reasons.  Some applications have outlived their usefulness;
 40833	            others may have grown too costly to continue supporting due to
 40834	            competition from other authors.

 41058	
 41059	            This appendix notes the author of each program listed in this
 41060	            catalog.  It comes in extremely handy when you want to see if a
 41061	            given program comes from an ASP member, or when you want to
 41062	            know the current version number/release date for a program.
 41063	            Hint: look in the index for the program (by name) if you want
 41064	            to see a full description for the program or learn the author's
 41065	            address & phone number.  You'll find page references for all
 41066	            the information you need.
