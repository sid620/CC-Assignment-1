    18	 BAWIT ['bay-wit'], Bay Area Women in Telecommunications, is a group
    19	 of women working with telecom, organized to discuss women's
    20	 professional and social issues and computer networking, including
    21	 industry gender bias. By doing so, BAWIT seeks to advance the state
    22	 of women who use telecom, to provide a higher profile for women in
    23	 the industry, and to encourage women and girls in their exploration
    24	 of computers in general, and in particular, telecom.

    42	 Introduction
    43	
    44	 Despite the fact that computer networking systems obscure physical
    45	 characteristics, many women find that gender follows them into the
    46	 online community, and sets a tone for their public and private
    47	 interactions there -- to such an extent that some women purposefully
    48	 choose gender neutral identities, or refrain from expressing their
    49	 opinions.
    50	
    51	 The experiences of women online are both personal and political. To a
    52	 certain extent, their causes are rooted in the physical world --
    53	 economics and social conditioning contribute to the limited numbers
    54	 of women online. Additionally, online environments are largely
    55	 determined by the viewpoints of their users and programmers, still
    56	 predominantly white men.
    57	
    58	 If network policies and legislation are going to determine access to
    59	 information and participation in public media for this and the next
    60	 generations, it is critical that they reflect and address the
    61	 perspectives of women and people of color, to avoid further
    62	 marginalization of these constituencies.  The following is an
    63	 overview of issues which members of BAWIT feel need to be addressed.
    64	 We feel that these are situations worthy of further investigation and
    65	 research.
    66	
    67	 Access
    68	
    69	 The Clinton administration has placed a priority on developing a
    70	 National Information Infrastructure, envisioning that computer
    71	 networks will be the information highways of the future. However, on
    72	 many systems, women comprise between 10 and 15 percent of the online
    73	 population. On electronic bulletin boards or BBSs, which are rarely
    74	 as supervised or monitored as the more well-known online services --
    75	 such as Compuserve, America_nline and Prodigy -- their numbers tend
    76	 to be far lower. Why? And what are the implications of inequities in
    77	 gender representation in the information infrastructure?
    78	
    79	 It is likely that economics impact women's online participation to a
    80	 large degree. On average, women's salaries are 40% lower than men's,
    81	 leaving women with less disposable income for computers, modems,
    82	 software, online services and any additional phone charges.
    83	
    84	While electronic mail [or e-mail] is fast becoming common in the
    85	 workplace, it is still predominantly used by those in technical
    86	 fields, whether in educational institutions or in business; or by
    87	 those with technical facility or training. Men who use the Internet
    88	 have a higher likelihood of being in an academic, management, or
    89	 technical position offering free access as one of the prerequisites
    90	 of their jobs. Thus, a higher percentage of men have both the
    91	 technical training and subsidized access to participate online than
    92	 women do.
    93	
    94	 Additional deterrents to online participation may be attributed to
    95	 women's roles in society. While more women are in the workplace, they
    96	 often are still primary caretakers for their children, and in a
    97	 majority of households, women bear the brunt of household chores.
    98	 Women may find they have less free time to learn to navigate online
    99	 systems.
   100	
   101	 Women in Computer Studies
   102	
   103	 Another deterrent to women's entering the computer field or making
   104	 themselves at home on the net is the negative stereotype of the
   105	 socially isolated computer nerd. Women may need help overcoming
   106	 visions of becoming or associating with technology-obsessed nerds and
   107	 adolescents who are seen as likely to populate online systems. This
   108	 has had research attention as a significant reason why females
   109	 students tend to drop out of computer studies.
   110	
   111	 Professors tend to call upon and address their remarks to male
   112	 students more often than female students, as several studies show.
   113	 Additionally, there are few opportunities for women to be mentored in
   114	 higher education or in their careers. Executives or professors --
   115	 often male -- are likely to identify with, encourage and mentor
   116	 another male, rather than a female. By itself, lack of attention or
   117	 mentors may not be a deterrent; however, coupled with other social
   118	 factors and discrimination, it often contributes to feelings of
   119	 discouragement and isolation, low confidence and feelings of
   120	 unworthiness, and higher dropout rates.
   121	
   122	 Despite the fact that women often use computers in business settings,
   123	 technical roles -- from programming of telecom software to operating
   124	 communications systems -- remain predominantly male. Invitations to
   125	 sysop gatherings addressed "Dear Sir" and including "your wife is
   126	 welcome," customers who ask for a manager when they hear a female
   127	 voice on a technical help call, and the popular culture archetypes of
   128	 computer enthusiasts as male, are continual reminders of common
   129	 assumptions based on gender. Even when female students do as well or
   130	 better than their male peers, they tend to feel less competent. In
   131	 technical fields, the common assumption by both men and by women
   132	 themselves is that women don't do as well as men. Women are then less
   133	 likely to take on projects which may either prove their ability or
   134	 provide additional expertise, because they don't feel qualified.
   135	
   136	 Interface
   137	
   138	 Access to online communications is not simply a function of
   139	 economics.  The technical expertise required to establish access to
   140	 online systems, and the interfaces users encounter when they get
   141	 there can be significant deterrents to online participation for
   142	 non-technical users. While graphical user interfaces can
   143	 significantly ameliorate this problem, they are system specific, a
   144	 situation which can hamper access for small or $community
   145	 organizations and lower income individuals who can only afford older
   146	 and non-standard equipment, if at all.
   147	
   148	 Studies have attempted to explain the reasons that fewer girls than
   149	 boys pursue technical fields. Some studies indicate that gender
   150	 impacts perception. Network interfaces are typically designed by men;
   151	 if the studies are correct, it would appear that developing
   152	 interfaces that rely on women's perceptive skills in addition to
   153	 men's would impact online participation. Interestingly enough, Les
   154	 Radke, who teaches a computer class at Richmond High, finds that in
   155	 his class boys gravitate towards computer games, while girls use
   156	 e-mail and read USENET.
   157	
   158	 Perceived Usefulness
   159	
   160	 An even greater deterrent for non-technical users is the perception
   161	 of usefulness. As BAWIT member Donna Zelzer explains: "...Look at the
   162	 automobile. It's expensive, it's mechanical... And, if you make a
   163	 mistake, you can KILL someone. And of course men make fun of women
   164	 drivers all the time. Yet despite these obstacles, millions of women
   165	 own cars and drive them every day. Why? Because they see cars as
   166	 useful and even necessary to their lifestyles. But most women don't
   167	 feel this way about computers or going online."
   168	
   169	 Network systems and projects geared to serving non-technical users
   170	 find that education is a tremendous part of their work, and that
   171	 concrete benefits must be demonstrated to overcome a new user's
   172	 investment of time and money to learn to telecommunicate. And what
   173	 are the benefits? Network users often describe virtual community as a
   174	 benefit of being online; professionals and activists find they can
   175	 gather, access, and disseminate information and viewpoints not
   176	 readily available from mass media. Yet while the networks can
   177	 democratize publishing, they also impose additional cost on
   178	 information. Herbert Schiller's "Culture, Inc.," among information
   179	 and space. As the nets become increasingly commercialized, they
   180	 further establish class differentiation between those who can afford
   181	 the luxury of participating in online systems and those who cannot.
   182	
   183	 Social Interaction and Gender-Based Perceptions
   184	
   185	 A newly created bulletin board in the Bay Area started up a
   186	 conference with a posting comparing women to pets that occasionally
   187	 need to be put to sleep. This type of demeaning communication
   188	 involving women is quite typical of bulletin boards, which may
   189	 provide an outlet for males to share humor they would suppress in a
   190	 mixed setting. This can be a disincentive to participate, especially
   191	 if this is an initial or persistent online experience.
   192	
   193	 People will say things online that they will not say face to face. In
   194	 addition, missing elements of conversation, such as facial
   195	 expression, vocal clues, and other conventions have a complex effect
   196	 on online interactions. Additionally there are unresolved
   197	 difficulties in the frank discussion and expression of sexuality
   198	 between men and women, in which intent is often misunderstood.
   199	
   200	 An element of this technology is a tradition of sometimes colorful
   201	 diatribes or "flaming". Since women tend to use language differently
   202	 then men do, these highly aggressive language patterns may be even
   203	 more of a barrier to our participation. Styles of communication
   204	 (sometimes referred to as "debate" and "relate" styles) often
   205	 complicate messages. While debating and arguing an issue is the
   206	 normal style for some people, others understand these debates as an
   207	 attack on them, causing them to pull away from the discussion. Being
   208	 sensitive to the style of communication can be as important as the
   209	 actual message being conveyed.
   210	
   211	 Deborah Tannen, among other authors and researchers, describes the
   212	 difference in language use between the genders and between different
   213	 families and cultures. Tannen identifies a less direct, more
   214	 inclusive style, designed to avoid arguments and confrontation, as a
   215	 more typically female method of communication.
   216	
   217	 Online Harassment
   218	
   219	 Many women who use Internet sites, electronic bulletin boards or
   220	 other online services, or even internal company-wide networks report
   221	 receiving invitations and messages of a sexually explicit nature in
   222	 real-time "chats" or via e-mail. These messages are variously
   223	 analogous to obscene phone calls or whistles in the street depending
   224	 on their tone. However, they take on an added annoyance factor for
   225	 women who are paying to utilize the resources of the online
   226	 environment. Additionally, these messages may be experienced
   227	 repeatedly by the same women because there tend to be fewer women on
   228	 most systems. Women looking for information online are often
   229	 surprised to see that a female first name can bring a distracting and
   230	 ultimately expensive volume of unsolicited contact, and give one the
   231	 sensation of being the first female to have arrived at a frontier
   232	 since pay dirt was struck. The problem is pervasive and annoying
   233	 enough that many women choose to switch to non-gender-specific login
   234	 names, for example, or to post to women-only conferences or mailing
   235	 lists.
   236	
   237	 A major obstacle that women have to deal with is that sexual
   238	 harassment is a relatively new concept in our society, and that
   239	 ignoring the situation can be a successful survival strategy in the
   240	 short run. Women may refrain from reporting perceptions of abuse
   241	 because of internalized peer pressure, based on observations of other
   242	 women being labeled "prudes" or otherwise mocked. Or they may hold
   243	 back due to the fear, or anecdotal evidence that charges are not
   244	 likely to be taken seriously by management. Women may not know that
   245	 harassment is by its very nature subjective, and that they may be
   246	 entitled to more privacy than they get.
   247	
   248	 "All of the cases I have seen filed involving e-mail or voice mail
   249	 were settled out of court, which says something about the strength of
   250	 the evidence," said Frieda Klein, a sexual harassment consultant, in
   251	 an article in MacWeek dated Dec. 14, 1992.
   252	
   253	 Guidelines for Monitoring Online Harassment
   254	
   255	 How can we prevent online harassment? The best way to bring this
   256	 about is education on the issues and recognizing when harassment
   257	 occurs. A MUSE role-playing community, Cyberion City at MIT, tries to
   258	 educate its participants with this definition of the problem:
   259	
   260	 "Unwanted advances of hostile or forward nature are unacceptable...
   261	 If you think someone might be interested in developing a closer
   262	 personal relationship, it is your responsibility to make absolutely
   263	 sure of this before saying or doing anything that would be considered
   264	 inappropriate in real life. Such inappropriate behavior includes, but
   265	 is not limited to, suggestive remarks; violation of the other
   266	 person's space; forward, intimate or suggestive conduct."
   267	
   268	"People on this system are of all ages and backgrounds... Most are not
   269	 here specifically to form intimate relationships, and it is
   270	 inappropriate to assume that someone is so interested unless you have
   271	 received clear indications of it. If you are unsure whether your
   272	 behavior is appropriate, STOP, and ASK. Many people are hesitant to
   273	 say 'go away' in so many words because they do not wish to be rude.
   274	 It is your responsibility to make sure they are saying 'yes' before
   275	 pursuing a close personal relationship."
   276	
   277	 Virtual or online harassment does not have a distinct legal
   278	 definition.  Case law has not yet been established for many
   279	 situations, but preexisting harassment and stalking laws may be used
   280	 as guidelines.  MacWeek, an industry publication, suggests the
   281	 following:
   282	
   283	 "Companies should print guidelines prohibiting sexual harassment and
   284	 distribute them to all employees. Those guidelines should be followed
   285	 up with training."
   286	
   287	 "The courts have held that sexually explicit posters hung on walls
   288	 can create a hostile work environment. Similarly, pornographic
   289	 computer programs or screen displays, particularly if visible to
   290	 passers-by, could constitute sexual harassment." "Managers should
   291	 treat any complaints of sexual harassment seriously. The company
   292	 should have clearly enunciated policy of progressive discipline,
   293	 ranging from warnings to terminations, depending on the severity of
   294	 the offense."
   295	
   296	 "After receiving complaints, managers and personnel departments
   297	 immediately should seek to stop the harassment and educate the
   298	 employees involved. A company is forbidden by law to retaliate
   299	 against anyone making a sexual-harassment complaint."
   300	
   301	 A company, including the network manager, may be held responsible if
   302	 harassment occurs or continues to occur in the office. We would do
   303	 well to find personal definitions in order to identify and address
   304	 problems which arise. It is vital that company managers educate
   305	 themselves and their employees, and have a anti-harassment policy
   306	 that includes online harassment. Awareness of the issue is the best
   307	 deterrent.
   308	
   309	 Increasing Our Participation: Possible Approaches, Future Directions
   310	
   311	 In the wake of the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings, companies and
   312	 individuals are beginning to address women's issues in a variety of
   313	 ways.  A Silicon Valley company recently arranged an all-day retreat
   314	 offsite for its women employees to discuss gender issues faced by
   315	 women in the computer industry and within the company. Issues
   316	 discussed included glass ceilings, differences in pay, percentage of
   317	 women working at the company, how to achieve success in technical
   318	 fields, and dealing with career and home lives. The dialog continues.
   319	
   320	 Across the bay, Berkeley Mac Women, a women's Macintosh users group,
   321	 formed completely independently within weeks of the creation of
   322	 BAWIT. At meetings, the all-women format has proven to be a more
   323	 comfortable environment for women computer users to ask questions.
   324	
   325	 Stacy Horn, who runs Echo BBS, wanted to ensure that the board be
   326	 gender-balanced. Using affirmative action efforts such as telecom
   327	 tutorials, outreach for women, and creating an environment that women
   328	 would feel more comfortable in, she brought the number of women users
   329	 up to about 50 percent. Seniornet, an online network of senior
   330	 citizens has about a 50-50 ratio of women to men. Online services
   331	 which stress community such as Seniornet, Echo and the WELL (the WELL
   332	 has between 15-20% women users) attract higher numbers of women.
   333	
   334	Women banded together to support one another on Santa Monica PEN, a
   335	 city system. This account is from an article called "What's Really
   336	 Happening in Santa Monica" in the December issue of IMPACT! from the
   337	 Boston Computer Society Social Impact Group and Public Service
   338	 Committee, by Pamela Varley:
   339	
   340	 "PENners quickly discover[ed] that they must contend with people who
   341	 feel entitled to hector mercilessly those with whom they
   342	 disagree....When the system started up, women -- who were greatly
   343	 outnumbered by men -- had problems with harassment....By the summer
   344	 of 1989, the few women on line were fed up and ready to drop out."
   345	
   346	 "In response to harassment,...the women on PEN banded together in
   347	 July 1989 to form a support group called PEN Femmes. The group makes
   348	 a point of welcoming women when they begin to participate in PEN
   349	 conferences.  Harassment has subsided as more women have become
   350	 active in conferences."
   351	
   352	 System interfaces need to be evaluated in terms of user preferences.
   353	 Since research indicates that women tend to learn and navigate
   354	 somewhat differently than men, increased participation of women as
   355	 software and system interface designers is an important goal.
   356	
   357	Simpler interfaces are of benefit to all users, but especially to
   358	 those without technical training. As the BMUG BBS switched to using a
   359	 simpler electronic messaging system with a Mac-like interface,
   360	 enthusiastic users genezFted four times the number of messages as on
   361	 the old BBS. The familiarity of the new interface attracts women Mac
   362	 users both with and without technical backgrounds who never or rarely
   363	 used the old one.
   364	
   365	 Rita Rouvalis, a BAWIT member, observes that "a list of Net
   366	 Celebrities I saw recently included only *3* women -- none of them
   367	 for technical merit.  Anita Borg, who runs the Systers [electronic
   368	 mailing] list, was not included. When I was taking computer science
   369	 courses in college, I knew that Niklaus Wirth wrote Pascal and
   370	 Modula2 and 3, and that Kernigie and Richie developed C -- but I had
   371	 no *idea* that Grace Hopper [inventor of COBOL] existed until her
   372	 death." Remembering women pioneers is one way to transform the
   373	 stereotypes of computer innovators.
   374	
   375	 Managers of communications networks and BBSs have many strategies to
   376	 try in making women welcome. Employing women as technical support
   377	 staff, or in other informed customer service roles, and encouraging
   378	 women to volunteer information to one another can help to take some
   379	 of the challenge out of learning a new set of skills. Special
   380	 approaches such as women-only tutorials, information campaigns and
   381	 rate subsidies are tools which may help systems approach a gender
   382	 balance.
   383	
   384	 Conclusion
   385	
   386	 How we address the issue of barriers to wider participation of women
   387	 has long-ranging impact on other issues such as racial harassment
   388	 versus inclusion, and the participation of gays, and the disabled.
   389	 Much is made of the tremendous potential electronic mail and
   390	 conferencing have to revitalize participatory democracy, but
   391	 intelligent, motivated affirmative action will be needed if racial
   392	 and gender barriers are to come tumbling down. Affirmative action can
   393	 be done on the institutional level, and it can also be done on a
   394	 grassroots level, by friends.
   395	
   396	
   397	 Suggested Readings
   398	
   399	 First of all, read and communicate with women online.
   400	
   401	 There is as yet little published about women and telecommunications.
   402	 Meanwhile, the general experience of women in computing is a backdrop
   403	 worth exploring. BAWIT has made a commitment to continue assembling a
   404	 bibliographic collection online.
