     1	Retail prices on SMC's most popular 8- and 16-bit Ethernet network
     2	interface cards have been reduced 20 to 35 per cent according to an
     3	announcement made today by the company. At the same time, SMC introduced
     4	both new and enhanced Elite Series Ethernet adapter cards featuring
     5	increased performance, reduced size and easier installation. The new
     6	boards expand the SMC EtherCard PLUS Elite adapter card line.
     7	
     8	The significant price reductions on SMC Ethernet cards became effective
     9	February 1,1992. According to Geof Karlin, SMC vice president of
    10	marketing, the price drops reflect a major benefit of SMC's ability to
    11	manufacture its own Ethernet chipset and bus interface LSI. "Our control
    12	of silicon integration allows us to pass along manufacturing cost
    13	advantages to our customers. This new, low pricing reflects SMC's
    14	commitment to remain the Ethernet price/performance leader."
    15	
    16	The five new EliteSeries boards from SMC consist of an 8-bit 10BASE-T; two
    17	16-bit Micro Channel cards -- one 10BASE-T and one coax; and two
    18	high-performance EISA adapters that feature two direct interfaces to
    19	twisted pair or thin coax wiring via on-board transceivers, and offer an
    20	alternative connection to a variety of media through an AUI port. The
    21	three enhanced EliteSeries boards are all 16-bit adapters -- one 10BASE-T,
    22	one coax and a combination 10BASE-T/coax version.
    23	
    24	The new and upgraded boards all feature higher levels of silicon
    25	integration for both increased reliability and ease of installation, and
    26	are 20% smaller than the previous generation boards they replace.
    27	
    28	"With the introduction of these new boards, we extend our line of Elite
    29	board offerings," said Karlin. "Further integration of our LSI and
    30	elimination of jumpers have allowed us to reduce space requirements on the
    31	boards while increasing their reliability and making them easy to
    32	configure. We expect these new cards to be as popular as the rest of the
    33	EliteSeries line."
    34	
    35	SMC EtherCard PLUS Elite boards are well-known for their outstanding
    36	performance and quality, and easy installation via two preconfigured
    37	jumper settings, or SMC's EZSETUP software configuration program. They
    38	offer the broadest driver support in the LAN industry through SMC's
    39	SuperDisk and third-party vendors.
    40	
    41	SMC is making its new EtherCard PLUS Elite boards available in convenient,
    42	easy-to-carry 6-packs with even more economical per-board retail prices -
    43	some as low as $165. This is equivalent to buying five boards, and getting
    44	the sixth free. Elite 6-packs will begin shipping in February, according
    45	to the company.
    46	
    47	SMC (NASD:SMSC) is one of the world's largest suppliers of PC LAN system
    48	products. The company is a major designer, manufacturer and marketer of
    49	10BASE-T/twisted pair, coax and fiber network interface cards,
    50	concentrators and network management products for the Ethernet and ARCNET
    51	markets. SMC currently has a worldwide installed base of over 3.5 million
    52	nodes.

    54	After announcing major retail price reductions on its Ethernet adapter
    55	cards, SMC said that five of its most popular boards will be available in
    56	6-packs at even lower prices beginning this month.
    57	
    58	SMC's 8-bit and 16-bit 10BASE-T and coax, as well as their 16-bit
    59	combination boards, are all available in the new packaging at a per-board
    60	price that is 20% off list, according to the company. All the boards are
    61	part of the SMC EliteSeries family of Ethernet adapter cards.
    62	
    63	"Resellers want to buy in volume whenever possible, so we're offering Elite
    64	Ethernet boards in a package that meets that need," said Kristine Stewart,
    65	SMC's director of channel marketing.
    66	
    67	The new boxes, complete with carrying handle, began shipping to
    68	distributors this month. Stewart said SMC is alerting the reseller
    69	community about the new packaging through what the company calls the Elite
    70	Treat direct mail campaign which features one of the 6-packs filled with
    71	gourmet popcorn and promotional materials. 
    72	
    73	"We shipped over 16,000 of these Elite Treat boxes worldwide. It's
    74	certainly the best tasting direct mail campaign we've ever had, and should
    75	attract quite a bit of attention," said Stewart.
