     4	A20
     5		(Address line 20) The 80286 and higher CPUs allow addresses in
     6	real mode to extend slightly beyond the one megabyte mark, which causes
     7	an incompatibility with some older programs which expect such addresses
     8	to wrap back to the beginning of the address space.  For complete
     9	compatibility with the 8088, newer machines thus contain circuitry
    10	which permits the twenty-first address line (A20) to be disabled.  The
    11	CPU then effectively has only twenty address lines in real mode, just
    12	as the 8088 does, and addresses which would extend beyond the one
    13	megabyte mark wrap to the beginning of the address space.  See also
    14	High Memory Area, Real Mode.
    15	
    16	ABIOS
    17		(Advanced BIOS) The IBM XT/286 and PS/2 models with 80286 or
    18	higher processors contain two separate BIOSes.  The ABIOS is a
    19	protected-mode BIOS which is used by OS/2.  For machines without an
    20	ABIOS, such as the IBM AT, OS/2 loads the equivalent of the ABIOS from
    21	disk.  see also CBIOS
    22	
    23	API
    24		(Application Program[ming] Interface) The defined set of calls
    25	which a program may make to interact with or request services of the
    26	operating system or environment under which it is running.  Because the
    27	inputs and outputs of the calls are well-defined, a program using the
    28	API can continue using the identical calls even if the internal
    29	organization of the program providing the API changes.
    30	
    31	APL
    32		(A Programming Language) An interactive, mathematically-
    33	oriented language which is well-suited to manipulating matrices.
    34	Originally using greek letters and numerous special symbols, thus
    35	requiring a special display, versions are now available which use
    36	keywords in place of the special symbols.
    37	
    38	ASCIZ
    39		A NUL-terminated ASCII string.  The ASCIZ string "ABC" consists
    40	of the four bytes 41h, 42h, 43h, and 00h.  Unless otherwise specified,
    41	maximum lengths given in the interrupt list do not include the
    42	terminating NUL.
    43	
    44	AVATAR
    45		(Advanced Video Attribute Terminal Assembler and Recreator) A
    46	set of control codes which may be used to affect the output of
    47	characters to the screen on systems equipped with an appropriate
    48	driver.  Similar in intent to ANSI sequences, AVATAR has shorter
    49	command sequences and provides additional PC-specific functionality.
    50	AVATAR is primarily used by the Opus and Maximus bulletin board systems
    51	(it was designed by one of the developers of the Opus system).
    52	
    53	BASIC
    54		(Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) A
    55	programming language originally designed as a means of teaching
    56	FORTRAN.  There are many variations of BASIC with differing
    57	capabilities; the majority are interpreted but compiled BASIC is
    58	becoming more popular.  All genuine IBM personal computers (including
    59	the latest PS/2 models) come equipped with a cassette-based BASIC
    60	interpreter in ROM.
    61	
    62	BCD
    63		(Binary Coded Decimal) A method of data storage where two
    64	decimal digits are stored in each byte, one in the upper four bits and
    65	the other in the lower four bits.  Since only the values 0 through 9
    66	are used in each half of a byte, BCD values can be read as decimal
    67	numbers on a hexadecimal display of memory or a file.
    68	
    69	Big-Endian
    70		One of the two major ways of organizing multi-byte numeric
    71	values in memory.  A big-endian layout places the most significant byte
    72	of the value in the lowest (first) memory location, i.e. 12345678h is
    73	stored as 12h 34h 56h 78h.  Motorola processors are big-endian.  Compare
    74	Little-Endian.
    75	
    76	BIOS
    77		(Basic Input/Output System) A set of standardized calls giving
    78	low-level access to the hardware.  The BIOS is the lowest software
    79	layer above the actual hardware and serves to insulate programs (and
    80	operating systems) which use it from the details of accessing the
    81	hardware directly.
    82	
    83	BIOS Parameter Block
    84		The BIOS Parameter Block stores the low-level layout of a
    85	drive.  See also INT 21h Function 53h.
    86	
    87	Boot
    88		To start up the computer or operating system. The term "boot"
    89	is a contraction of "bootstrap", which in turn comes from the
    90	expression "to lift oneself by one's boot straps."  The ROM BIOS on IBM
    91	PCs and compatibles reads in the first sector of the disk, which
    92	contains a short (less than 500 bytes) program that reads in a portion
    93	of the operating system, which in turn reads in the remainder of the
    94	operating system.
    95	
    96	Boot Drive
    97		The disk drive from which the operating system was booted.  See
    98	also Boot.
    99	
   100	BPB
   101		see BIOS Parameter Block
   102	
   103	Breakpoint
   104		When debugging, a memory location which when accessed causes a
   105	break in the normal flow of execution and the invocation of the
   106	debugger.  Used to let a program run at full speed until a certain
   107	instruction is reached or (less frequently) a particular data item is
   108	accessed or changed.
   109	
   110	Cache
   111		Caching is a method of increasing performance by keeping
   112	frequently-used data in a location which is more quickly accessed. The
   113	most common caches are disk caches (store disk sectors in RAM) and RAM
   114	caches (store portions of main memory in special high-speed RAM which
   115	may be accessed as fast as the CPU is capable of accessing memory).
   116	See also Delayed Write, Write-Through.
   117	
   118	Callback
   119		A call to a specified function made by the operating system or
   120	operating environment when a request (usually an asynchronous request)
   121	completes.  This permits the calling program to continue operating while
   122	the request is processed yet still be aware of its completion
   123	immediately without the need to constantly poll the request's status.
   124	See also Callout.
   125	
   126	Callout
   127		A call made by the operating system, operating environment, or
   128	an application program on various events, which may be intercepted by
   129	other software which is interested in the current state of the system.
   130	See also Callback, External Device Interface.

   132	CAS
   133		see Communicating Applications Specification
   134	
   135	CBIOS
   136		(Compatibility BIOS) The IBM XT/286 and PS/2 models with 80286
   137	or higher processors contain two separate BIOSes.  The CBIOS is a
   138	real-mode BIOS which is compatible with the earlier products in the IBM
   139	PC family and PS/2 models with 8086 processors.  See also ABIOS.

   141	CDS
   142		see Current Directory Structure
   143	
   144	CGA
   145		(Color/Graphics Adapter) One of the two video display boards
   146	introduced together with the original IBM PC.  See also HGC, MDA.
   147	
   148	Clock Tick
   149		1/18.2 second, or approximately 55 milliseconds.  This is the
   150	rate at which the IBM PC's system clock is updated.
   151	
   152	CMOS
   153		(Complementary Metal-Oxide-Silicon) A type of integrated
   154	circuit design known for its low power consumption.
   155	
   156	CMOS RAM
   157		A small amount (typically 64 or 128 bytes) of memory in the system's
   158	real-time clock chip that is preserved by the clock's battery and is used for
   159	storing configuration information.  See also Real-Time Clock.
   160	
   161	Communicating Applications Specification
   162		DCA and Intel's standard programmatic interface for sending and
   163	receiving FAXes via any of a number of internal FAX boards.
   164	
   165	CP/M
   166		(Control Program for Microcomputers) An early operating system
   167	for micros based on the 8-bit Intel 8080 CPU (and later the compatible
   168	8085 and Zilog Z80 CPUs).  MSDOS version 1.0 was essentially a clone of
   169	CP/M for the Intel 8086.
   170	
   171	CP/M-86
   172		One of the three operating systems offered by IBM for its
   173	original PC (the other two were MSDOS and the UCSD p-System).  It has
   174	since evolved into DR-DOS version 6.
   175	
   176	CPU
   177		(Central Processing Unit) The microprocessor which executes
   178	programs on your computer.
   179	
   180	Current Directory Structure
   181		The data record used by DOS to keep track of the current
   182	directory on a drive; whether the drive is valid, network, SUBSTituted,
   183	or JOINed; and other pertinent information.  See also INT 21h Function
   184	52h.
   185	
   186	Cylinder
   187		The set of concentric tracks of data located at the same
   188	position on each data-bearing surface of the disk. A double-sided
   189	floppy will contain two tracks per cylinder.
   190	
   191	DAC
   192		(Digital-to-Analog Converter) A hardware device (in its simplest
   193	form, nothing more than a set of interconnected resistors) which converts
   194	a digital number into an analog signal whose voltage is proportional to
   195	the value of the digital number.  VGA and later color video boards use
   196	DACs to convert color values into the analog signals sent to the display;
   197	sound boards normally use DACs as well.
   198	
   199	DCC
   200		(Display Combination Code) A number which indicates both the
   201	type of display adapter board and the type of monitor attached to the
   202	video board.
   203	
   204	Delayed Write
   205		A form of caching in which control is returned before the data is
   206	actually written to the storage media.  See also Cache, Write-Through.
   207	
   208	Device Driver
   209		An interface module between the device-independent portions of
   210	the operating system and an actual hardware device which converts
   211	device-independent requests into the actual sequence of device
   212	operations to perform the requested action.  IO.SYS contains the
   213	standard, built-in MSDOS device drivers such as CON, COM1, AUX, PRN,
   214	etc.  See also INT 21h Function 52h and INT 2Fh Function 0802h.
   215	
   216	Device Driver Request Header
   217		The data structure passed to a device driver which contains the
   218	command to be executed, its parameters, and space for a returned status
   219	and data values.  See INT 2Fh Function 0802h.
   220	
   221	DGIS
   222		(Direct Graphics Interface Standard)
   223	
   224	Direct Memory Access
   225		A method whereby peripherals may transfer data into or out of
   226	main memory without the involvement of the CPU.
   227	
   228	Disk Transfer Address
   229		The Disk Transfer Address indicates where functions which do
   230	not take an explicit data address will read or store data.  Although
   231	the name implies that only disk accesses use this address, other
   232	functions use it as well.  See INT 21h Function 4Eh for an example of
   233	the DTA's use.
   234	
   235	DLL
   236		see Dynamic Link Library
   237	
   238	DMA
   239		see Direct Memory Access
   240	
   241	DOS Extender
   242		A program which allows a program to run in protected mode while still
   243	retaining access to real-mode MSDOS services.  See also Protected Mode.
   244	
   245	DOS Parameter List
   246		The DOS Parameter List is used to pass arguments to SHARE and
   247	network functions.  See also INT 21h Function 5D00h.
   248	
   249	DOS Protected-Mode Interface
   250		An API which provides basic services for protected-mode programs to
   251	allocate memory, invoke real-mode software, etc.  See also Virtual Control
   252	Program Interface.

   261		see DOS Protected-Mode Interface
   262	
   263	DRAM
   264		(Dynamic Random Access Memory) RAM memory which essentially consists
   265	of a tiny capacitor for each bit of memory.  Since capacitors do not hold
   266	a charge indefinitely, DRAM must be constantly refreshed to avoid losing
   267	its contents.  Also, the process of reading the contents of the memory are
   268	destructive, meaning extra time must be spent restoring the contents of
   269	memory addresses which are accessed, so DRAM is slower than SRAM.  See also
   270	Refresh, SRAM.
   271	
   272	Drive Parameter Block
   273		The DOS Drive Parameter Block stores the description of the
   274	media layout for a logical drive, as well as some housekeeping
   275	information.  See also INT 21h Function 1Fh and INT 21h Function 32h.
   276	
   277	DTA
   278		see Disk Transfer Address
   279	
   280	DWORD
   281		Doubleword; four bytes.  Commonly used to hold a 32-bit
   282	segment:offset or selector:offset address.
   283	
   284	Dynamic Link Library
   285		A collection of subroutines which are linked with a program at
   286	the time it is loaded into memory rather than permanently placed in the
   287	executable.  This has the advantage of allowing a single copy of the
   288	subroutine library to reside on disk or in memory even when it is used
   289	by many programs.  It also permits all programs using the DLL to be
   290	updated without recompiling simply by installing a new version of the
   291	library.
   292	
   293	EGA
   294		(Enhanced Graphics Adapter) IBM's second color video board for the
   295	IBM PC family, capable of a maximum resolution of 640x350 pixels in 16
   296	simultaneous colors of a total of 64 possible colors.
   297	
   298	EISA
   299		(Enhanced Industry-Standard Architecture) A 32-bit superset of the
   300	IBM AT's expansion bus (which is now known as the ISA or Industry-Standard
   301	Architecture bus).
   302	
   303	EMS
   304		see Expanded Memory Specification
   305	
   306	EOI
   307		(End of Interrupt) A particular command sent to the interrupt
   308	controller to indicate that the interrupt has been handled by software
   309	and that new interrupts of the same or lower priority may now be signalled
   310	by the interrupt controller.
   311	
   312	ESDI
   313		(Enhanced Small Device Interface) A disk drive interface type
   314	which was briefly popular before IDE took over.  An ESDI drive can
   315	transfer data between the drive and controller at 10, 15, or 20
   316	megabits per second, which is faster than an MFM or RLL controller but
   317	slower than what is possible with an IDE or SCSI drive.  See also IDE.
   318	
   319	Exception
   320		A signal by the CPU that some error condition has been encountered
   321	that it can not deal with without a program's intervention.  The most commonly
   322	encountered exceptions on Intel processors are Exceptions 12 and 13, which
   323	are stack and general problems, respectively.  Exception 13 is typically
   324	caused by a memory access which wraps from the end of a segment back to
   325	the beginning.
   326	
   327	Expanded Memory Specification
   328		A specification devised by Lotus, Intel, and Microsoft for
   329	accessing more than one megabyte of memory by bank-switching additional
   330	memory into the one megabyte real mode address space.
   331	
   332	Extended BIOS Data Area
   333		A block of memory, typically the 1K at the top of conventional
   334	memory, which is used to store additional data for use by the BIOS which
   335	does not fit into the 256-byte data area at segment 0040h.
   336	
   337	Extended File Control Block
   338		A DOS File Control Block which has had an additional seven
   339	bytes prepended to permit control of file attributes (which are stored
   340	in the appendage).  See also FCB.
   341	
   342	Extended Memory
   343		Memory beyond the one megabyte address which is available only
   344	on 80286 and higher machines.  Except for a small portion (the High
   345	Memory Area), extended memory is only accessible from protected mode.
   346	
   347	Extended Memory Specification
   348		A specification devised by Microsoft which allows multiple
   349	programs to share extended (above 1 megabyte) memory and noncontiguous
   350	memory above 640K.  See also Upper Memory Block.
   351	
   352	External Device Interface
   353		A series of calls made by the DESQview multitasker on various
   354	"interesting" events, which may be intercepted by programs which wish to
   355	keep track of the current system state.  See also Callout.
   356	
   357	FAT
   358		see File Allocation Table
   359	
   360	FCB
   361		see File Control Block
   362	
   363	File Allocation Table
   364		A data structure on disk that records which clusters are free,
   365	which are unusable, and which have been allocated.  The clusters occupied
   366	by a file are linked into a list in the file allocation table, allowing
   367	DOS to find the contents of the file.
   368	
   369	File Control Block
   370		A data record in the calling program's address space which is
   371	used by DOS 1.x functions to record the state of an open file.  See
   372	also INT 21h Function 13h.
   373	
   374	File Handle
   375		A small positive integer used to identify the previously-opened
   376	file on which a program wishes to perform an operation.
   377	
   378	Flush
   379		To force the copying of any data still stored in temporary
   380	buffers to its final destination.
   381	
   382	FM
   383		(Frequency Modulation)  A method of encoding data as a series of
   384	magnetic flux reversals on disk or tape, commonly known as single-density
   385	recording.  In frequency modulation, a series of clock pulses are written
   386	at regular intervals, with one data bit for each clock pulse.  See also
   387	MFM, RLL.
   388	
   389	Formatting
   390		Preparing a storage medium (usually magnetic media such as a
   391	disk or tape) for storing data.  Low-level or physical formatting
   392	writes all necessary housekeeping data to enable the storage device
   393	to read the media and may also initialize the storage units on the
   394	media to a known state.  High-level or logical formatting writes data
   395	used by the operating system, such as allocation information and
   396	directories onto media which has already been physically formatted.
   397	Formatting programs often perform both a low-level and a high-level
   398	format.
   399	
   400	FOSSIL
   401		(Fido/Opus/Seadog Standard Interface Layer)  A standardized API
   402	for performing serial I/O, originally used by the Fido and Opus bulletin-
   403	board software and Seadog bulletin-board mailer, but now in wider use.
   404	
   405	FTP
   406		(File Transfer Protocol)  The standard protocol for copying files
   407	from one machine to another on a TCP/IP (Internet) network.  Also the
   408	program of the same name with which a user may transfer files.
   409	
   410	Gather-Write
   411		see Scatter/Gather
   412	
   413	Handle
   414		A short identifier, usually a small integer or a pointer, for
   415	some other object which is maintained or controlled by the operating
   416	system or environment; a particular handle may be valid system-wide or
   417	may have meaning only for a particular process.  See also File Handle.
   418	
   419	HGC
   420		(Hercules Graphics Controller) A monochrome video adapter capable
   421	of 720x352 monochrome graphics.  The HGC was the first non-IBM video
   422	adapter for the IBM PC.  See also CGA, MDA.
   423	
   424	High Memory Area
   425		The first 65520 bytes (64K less 16 bytes) of extended memory.
   426	This area is accessible from real mode on the 80286 and higher
   427	processors because these processors do not wrap addresses at one
   428	megabyte as the 8088 and 8086 do.  See also A20, INT 2Fh Functions
   429	4A01h.
   430	
   431	HMA
   432		see High Memory Area
   433	
   434	Horizontal Retrace
   435		When a monitor has finished displaying a single scan line, it must
   436	move it electron beam(s) back to the left edge of the CRT, during which time
   437	it turns off the beam.  On the original CGA (and some early clones), the
   438	only time one could access the display memory without causing "snow" was
   439	during the horizontal or vertical retrace periods, as the display adapter
   440	was not itself accessing the display memory during those times.  See also
   441	Vertical Retrace.
   442	
   443	IDE
   444		(Integrated Drive Electronics) A type of disk drive interface
   445	which essentially extends the PC's expansion bus all the way to the

   696	the MSDOS kernel to operate on devices it recognizes as network
   697	devices.  These function calls provide a lower-level interface than the
   698	INT 21h calls made to DOS, allowing a program intercepting these
   699	functions to be simpler than one intercepting INT 21h calls.  See INT
   700	2Fh Functions 1100h through 1130h.
   701	
   702	Refresh
   703		The process of periodically rewriting the contents of a DRAM

   716	(on average), fewer than one flux reversal per data bit is required
   717	(however, timing becomes more critical).  RLL is actually an entire
   718	family of encoding methods, specified with two numbers indicating the
   719	minimum and maximum distances between one bits (flux transitions).  The
   720	variant normally called RLL is RLL-2,7; RLL-1,7 and RLL-3,9 are also in
   721	use.  MFM is in effect RLL-1,3.  See also FM, MFM.

   731		The actual key number sent by the keyboard, which differs from the
   732	key codes seen by application programs.  The enhanced (101/102-key) keyboard
   733	actually sends different scan codes than the original (83/84-key) IBM
   734	keyboard, but these are normally translated by the keyboard controller into
   735	the scan codes used by the original keyboard before they become visible to
   736	programs.
   737	
   738	Scatter/Gather
   739		A technique in which the contiguous data of a disk sector or sectors
   740	is transferred to or from multiple non-contiguous areas of memory.  When
   741	reading into multiple areas of memory, this is called a scatter-read; the
   742	opposing operation is called gather-write.

   772	SRAM
   773		(Static Random Access Memory)  RAM which typically consists of one
   774	flip-flop per bit of memory.  Unlike DRAMs, static RAM retains its contents
   775	as long as power is applied.  Because there is no need to refresh the
   776	contents of memory addresses which are read, SRAM is faster than DRAM,
   777	but it is more expensive and typically is available in much smaller sizes
   778	than DRAM because each bit occupies more space on the chip.  See also DRAM.

   846	Vertical Retrace
   847		When a monitor has finished displaying an image by sweeping its
   848	electron beam(s) over the face of the CRT, it has to move the beam back up
   849	to the top of the display.  During the time this takes, the beam is turned
   850	off.  The vertical retrace interval is a good time to change the displayed
   851	picture for smooth animation.  See also Horizontal Retrace.
