   172	     1.   Forward
   173	
   174	          The purpose of this guide is to provide tips on how to start
   175	          and run a shareware disk vending service.  A shareware disk
   176	          vending service (Vendor) is defined as someone or a company
   177	          that gathers and maintains a collection of shareware
   178	          evaluation disks (creates a library), keeps the library up to
   179	          date, publishes a catalog (printed and/or on-disk) and sells
   180	          evaluation copies to end users.  Some vendors specialize in
   181	          mail/telephone order, others operate booths at fairs, flea
   182	          markets, booths in malls, etc.
   183	
   184	          A variant of a disk vendor is one that places racks of
   185	          shareware in one or more retail locations.  This is usually
   186	          referred to as a "Rack Vendor" as compared to a "Mail Order
   187	          Vendor" as described above.  The Rack Vendor shares a portion
   188	          of the sales price with the owner of the rack location.  Racks
   189	          are often found in airport gift shops, convenience stores,
   190	          retail chain stores like Walmart, K-Mart, book stores, etc. 
   191	          Further, the Rack Vendor replenishes the supply of disks in
   192	          the racks.  The racks vary from cardboard displays to fancy
   193	          wire or metal racks.
   194	
   195	          Another type of vendor are those that produce CD-ROMs that
   196	          contain shareware software.
   197	
   198	          This guide is going to folks who are considering starting a
   199	          disk vendor business, so some of the points may seem obvious
   200	          or elementary to experienced vendors.
   201	
   202	          The information and opinions in this guide are drawn from
   203	          talking to many vendors from the ASP headquarters and from the
   204	          contributions of many ASP members.  Many of the ideas and
   205	          concepts in this document are discussed from time to time on
   206	          the ASPFORUM on CompuServe.  If you have access to CompuServe,
   207	          GO SHARE to reach the ASP forum and "talk" to hundreds of ASP
   208	          members.
   209	
   210	          This document has been put together and freely distributed in
   211	          the spirit of sharing. The ASP does not make money from it.
   212	          All input, new information and corrections are gratefully
   213	          accepted.

   231	          1.1  What Is Shareware?
   232	
   233	               Nelson Ford (one of the ASP's founders and historians)
   234	               relates the following: "Andrew Fluegelman started the
   235	               formal shareware concept (he trademarked the name
   236	               Freeware for it).  Andy did not say that everyone who
   237	               spent an afternoon writing a program, uploaded it to a
   238	               couple of BBSs and sat back and waited would get rich. 
   239	               He said that the freeware approach provides a way to let
   240	               the users decide (rather than the people who control the
   241	               advertising prices) which programs should succeed, based
   242	               solely on the quality and usefulness of the program."
   243	
   244	               Later, an article in InfoWorld used the term "shareware"
   245	               and as far as we know, Bob Wallace (PC-Write) was the
   246	               first to use it with a shareware product.  Also during
   247	               that time, Nelson Ford wrote a column called "The Public
   248	               Library" for the late SOFTALK magazine.  Nelson asked his
   249	               readers to submit names for this new way of marketing
   250	               software and the word "shareware" was the winner.  Over
   251	               the years, the ASP has fought trademark cases in several
   252	               countries when someone tried to trademark the word
   253	               "shareware".  The ASP firmly believes that the word
   254	               "shareware" should be freely used by anyone.
   255	
   256	               Nelson continues, "Shareware is not some magic way to get
   257	               rich from trivial or substandard, amateurish products of
   258	               limited appeal or usefulness.  Some shareware programmers
   259	               who have failed prefer to blame the shareware approach
   260	               rather than themselves.  They think that millions of
   261	               people are using their programs without paying and that
   262	               the shareware concept just doesn't work."
   263	
   264	               "To these people we always reply: If shareware doesn't
   265	               work, how are Button (PC-File), Wallace (PC-Write), and
   266	               others making over a million dollars a year at it? 'These
   267	               are exceptions!' they reply. Sure they are exceptions.
   268	               Anyone making a million dollars a year at anything is an
   269	               exception. Many others are making lesser, but
   270	               respectable, incomes. Not bad for a business that anyone
   271	               can get into at virtually no up-front cost."
   272	
   273	               "Yes, shareware definitely works.  Like anything else,
   274	               how well it works for you depends on hard work, ability,
   275	               and even a little bit of luck.  And even luck often boils
   276	               down to being prepared to take advantage of opportunities
   277	               when they coming knocking.  We hope this guide will help
   278	               you get prepared."

   286	     2.   Introduction
   287	
   288	          These days, it seems that many people that recently  purchased
   289	          their first computer and ran across the shareware concept
   290	          think they can easily get into the shareware disk vendor
   291	          business.  They see the catalogs produced by other vendors and
   292	          say "I could do that."  Or, they realize that there are no
   293	          disk vendors in their part of the country.
   294	
   295	          Starting a shareware disk vending business is a lot more work
   296	          than first meets the eye.  There are hardware, software and
   297	          knowledge requirements that must be considered and mastered. 
   298	          First, you need a shareware disk collection AND permission
   299	          from the authors (copyright holders) to distribute the
   300	          shareware.  Next, you need appropriate hardware.  Most
   301	          importantly, you need a lot of marketing, computer and
   302	          software knowledge to succeed.  If you are just looking for a
   303	          fast buck, are not willing to review the programs you carry,
   304	          don't plan to get the latest versions, don't plan to prepare
   305	          an organized catalog, GIVE UP NOW - you will probably fail in
   306	          this highly competitive business.

   308	          However, if you don't give up, realize that there are
   309	          thousands of disk distributors in the world today.  New ones
   310	          start up almost daily.  Unfortunately, vendors fail and go out
   311	          of business fairly often.  Where you will fit into the
   312	          shareware picture is largely up to you and your efforts.  We
   313	          hope that after reading this document, you will either be a
   314	          successful shareware disk vendor or you will have the detailed
   315	          information to cause you to explore different profit
   316	          opportunities.  If you are already a shareware disk vendor,
   317	          this document may give you tips on how to be more successful.
   318	
   319	          Keep in mind that a shareware disk vendor does NOT own or
   320	          control the copyright on the shareware programs, documentation
   321	          and supporting files provided by the author.  The author owns
   322	          and controls the copyright.  The author can select who will be
   323	          allowed to copy his/her shareware and how it is to be
   324	          distributed.  The copyrights ARE enforceable.  RESPECT the
   325	          author's copyright.  Examine every disk, not sent to you
   326	          directly by the author, to see if the author has placed any
   327	          copying restrictions on the disk.  You will likely need to 
   328	          write to the authors asking permission to carry their
   329	          shareware.  You may get both permission AND the latest
   330	          version.  Some will even send major future upgrades.
   331	
   332	          There are some authors that require that all RACK and CD-ROM
   333	          vendors get written permission and SOMETIMES royalty payments
   334	          BEFORE the vendor can place the author's copyrighted works on
   335	          racks or CD-ROMs EVEN IF THEY SENT YOU THEIR DISK IN THE FIRST
   336	          PLACE.  FOLLOW ALL COPYING RESTRICTIONS OR RISK LAWSUITS

   344	
   345	          3.1  Identify Your Market Niche
   346	
   347	               What got you interested in becoming a shareware disk
   348	               vendor?  What are your objectives?  How much time can you
   349	               devote to disk vending?  What are your financial
   350	               resources?  Have you formulated a Business Plan?  What
   351	               level is right for you to start?  How big do you want to
   352	               get?  Are you prepared to succeed?  Are you prepared to
   353	               fail?
   354	
   355	               3.1.1     Local Shows & Flea Markets.
   356	
   357	                         A really low cost way of starting is to take a
   358	                         card table to a local computer show, swap meet
   359	                         or flea market and set up a "booth".  You have
   360	                         a box full of shareware disk copies, a list of
   361	                         titles and a cash box.  Sounds easy?  Well, a
   362	                         lot of work is behind that simple "booth".
   363	
   364	
   365	               3.1.2     Selling Shareware From Your Retail Store.
   366	
   367	                         You already operate a computer, book, or other
   368	                         retail store likely to be frequented by
   369	                         computer users (almost anyone these days).  You
   370	                         operate like the flea market fellow except that
   371	                         you have counter or shelf space in place of the
   372	                         card table and you have a cash register rather
   373	                         than a cash box.
   374	
   375	
   376	               3.1.3     Shopping Malls.
   377	
   378	                         This approach is similar to the Flea Market
   379	                         approach except that you operate out of a small
   380	                         booth in the walkway of a shopping mall.
   381	
   382	
   383	               3.1.4     Mail Order Shareware.
   384	
   385	                         You put together either a printed or on-disk
   386	                         catalog for your customers to make telephone or
   387	                         mail order purchases.  You advertise in trade
   388	                         magazines, local newspapers, local "shopper's
   389	                         guides" or you make blind mailings to targeted
   390	                         purchased mailing lists.  You should be able to
   391	                         take credit card orders to succeed in telephone
   392	                         or mail order.

   405	
   406	                         A Rack Vendor is one that places racks of
   407	                         shareware in one or more retail locations.  The
   408	                         Rack Vendor shares a portion of the sales price
   409	                         with the owner of the rack location.  Racks are
   410	                         often found in airport gift shops, convenience
   411	                         stores, retail chain stores like Walmart, K-
   412	                         Mart, book stores, etc.  Further, the Rack
   413	                         Vendor replenishes the supply of disks in the
   414	                         racks.  The racks vary from cardboard displays
   415	                         to fancy wire or metal racks.
   416	
   417	               You can combine any or all of the above as dictated by
   418	               your resources and situation.

   421	          3.2  Collecting Shareware Disks - Overview.
   422	
   423	               Investigate the marketplace.  See what others are doing. 
   424	               Determine how you want to tackle the market.  Your disks
   425	               must come directly from the author so that you get the
   426	               latest and don't have copyright problems.  However, you
   427	               can obtain disks from the various sources below so that
   428	               you will know which authors to contact.  Make sure the
   429	               list you put together IS of shareware or public domain
   430	               and NOT ripped-off commercial or traditional retail type
   431	               software.
   432	
   433	               Section 9 will cover Collecting Shareware in more detail. 
   434	               Following is a quick overview of some of the ways to
   435	               start your shareware list.
   436	
   437	               3.2.1     You have been involved with a large local User
   438	                         Group and have obtained a copy of their
   439	                         collection to build a list of authors.
   440	
   441	               3.2.2     You are an avid BBSer that has downloaded a lot
   442	                         of shareware to build a list of authors.
   443	
   444	               3.2.3     You purchase disks from various other vendors
   445	                         to build your list of authors to contact.
   446	
   447	               3.2.4     You obtain a CD-ROM disk containing hundreds or
   448	                         thousands of shareware and public domain
   449	                         programs.  You use this to build your list of
   450	                         authors to contact.
   451

   457	     3.   Getting Started (Continued)
   458	
   459	          3.3  Reviewing The Disks
   460	
   461	               Scan EVERY disk for virus infections.  Be sure you also
   462	               scan shrinkwrapped "retail" software as tens of thousands
   463	               of infected disks are shipped by major retailers every
   464	               year.  They think viri are a shareware or BBS problem
   465	               (NOT TRUE) and they are careless and sloppy in preparing
   466	               their master disks.
   467	
   468	               Know what is in your collection.  Don't just quickly read
   469	               the on-disk documentation.  Many ASP authors have a
   470	               VENDOR.DOC file that contains any copying or distribution
   471	               restrictions, a list of the files that must be present
   472	               and a catalog description.  Starting in 1994, you will
   473	               see a VENDINFO.DIZ file that will eventually replace the
   474	               VENDOR.DOC file.  However, you should install the
   475	               shareware and run it.
   476	
   477	               By running the software, you may find that you have
   478	               obtained a damaged or incomplete disk.  If you distribute
   479	               this disk, you will get expensive to handle technical
   480	               support calls and you will have to give credit or send
   481	               out another disk.  Or the customer will call the author. 
   482	               Most authors send these customers a new disk AND
   483	               recommend some other vendor to your PREVIOUS customer. 
   484	               The same authors also recommend other vendors if you
   485	               insist on carrying old versions.
   486	
   487	               If the software isn't better or different than what you
   488	               are already carrying in your catalog, you may not wish to
   489	               carry the shareware.  Or, you may find the new system
   490	               better and use it to replace an existing catalog entry. 
   491	               For example, YADS stands for "Yet Another DOS Shell" or
   492	               menu system.  Seems like everyone thinks they have
   493	               designed the best there is.  They haven't even looked at
   494	               what is already available in the shareware marketplace. 
   495	               You just can't afford to carry all of the menu systems,
   496	               screen blankers, clocks, tickler systems, etc. that are
   497	               constantly being designed by the authors.
   498	
   499	               LOOK FOR the author's distribution restrictions.  Some
   500	               authors will NOT allow you to carry the shareware unless
   501	               you get written permission from them.  As mentioned
   502	               before, you should contact the author anyway as you will
   503	               probably get the latest version if the author gives you
   504	               permission.  SOME authors not only require written
   505	               permission, but may also require royalties from rack and
   506	               CD-ROM vendors even though they may have sent you their
   507	               disks in the first place.

   516	          3.3  Reviewing The Disks (Continued)
   517	
   518	               Look for files advertising other vendors.  The files
   519	               placed on disks the other vendor distributes are probably
   520	               copyrighted by that vendor and you can not issue disks
   521	               with that file.  Further, you don't want to advertise
   522	               that other vendor's service.
   523	
   524	               Vendors can copyright "compilations" of many separate
   525	               small shareware systems on one disk.  This is often done
   526	               with small utilities.  The vendor can NOT copyright the
   527	               individual programs and documentation (not written by the
   528	               vendor), as the authors retain their own copyrights. 
   529	               BUT, they can copyright the compilation.  Don't forget
   530	               you still need permission from many of the authors to
   531	               carry their system even in a compilation.
   532	
   533	               You must build up your own compilations that don't
   534	               infringe on the other vendor's copyrights.
   535	
   536	               If you use disk numbers in your catalog, don't copy some
   537	               other vendors numbering system.  You could end up in
   538	               court.  Do your own thing.  Don't use the program
   539	               descriptions out of some other vendor's catalog.  This is
   540	               another way to look for copyright trouble.  However, the
   541	               same description may appear in many vendor catalogs IF
   542	               they all use the author's description found in the
   543	               VENDOR.DOC or VENDINFO.DIZ files used by many authors. 
   544	               You may use the author's description if it isn't pure
   545	               hype.  Be sure that you describe the shareware on the
   546	               disk and not some retail product the author is pushing in
   547	               place of the shareware.
   548	
   549	               If you are/become a member of the ASP, you will receive
   550	               the latest Official ASP Catalog each month that contains
   551	               the author written program descriptions.  You will also
   552	               receive a CD-ROM approximately monthly.

   555	          3.4  Logos & Letterhead
   556	
   557	               If you really want to go into a business, get your ducks
   558	               lined up first.  Pick a company name.  Coming up with a
   559	               unique name could be a tough one, particularly if you use
   560	               the word "shareware".  Also, avoid the word "freeware" as
   561	               Headland Press still owns the Trademark on that word.  A
   562	               lot of authors of shareware REALLY don't like to send
   563	               their disks to an outfit with the words "public domain"
   564	               in their name as that implies "free" (read that as no
   565	               registration income).

   578	               can find someone to design a logo.  At least get some
   579	               help laying out your letterhead even if you don't use a
   580	               logo.
   581	
   582	               Create a Business Plan.  Prepare a budget for the next
   583	               several years that compares your expected income with
   584	               expected expenses.  What advertising schedules will you
   585	               use?  Where are you heading or where could you head? 
   586	               Look at the market.  What penetration do you expect?
   587	
   588	               Go to your local IRS office (in the USA) and find out how
   589	               to get a Federal Tax I.D. number.  It costs nothing. 
   590	               Even if you have no employees, you will need it for your
   591	               Tax Schedule C.  Many states that have Sales & Use taxes
   592	               will use the same number for your State Tax license
   593	               number.  Contact your State sales tax office.
   594	
   595	               Get a business checking account.  It makes it easier to
   596	               track your costs and income for tax purposes.  If you
   597	               have a good history with your bank, you may be able to
   598	               get a Master/Visa Merchant account from them.  Being able
   599	               to handle credit card sales is a real asset.  Do you have
   600	               a sharp looking business card to hand to the bank manager
   601	               when you are applying for a credit card Merchant Account? 
   602	               You should be dressed in a business like manor.  Have
   603	               every phase of your image be business like.
   604	
   605	               The image you present is very important.  It conveys a
   606	               lot about your drive and commitment to succeed.  Send out
   607	               professional looking letters to the authors and others. 
   608	               Many authors will "round-file" (read that - trash)
   609	               letters not on letterhead paper printed with a 9-pin dot
   610	               matrix printer in the draft mode.  If you received such a
   611	               letter, would you consider the sender to be "for real"
   612	               and commit the expense to send disks?

   628	     4.   Preparing Your Catalog
   629	
   630	          If you are a Rack Vendor, your catalog may consist of a Table
   631	          of Contents type of listing on your rack.  You may only have
   632	          the descriptions on the disk packages.  If you are a Rack
   633	          Vendor, you may be able to skip after you read Section 4.1.
   634	
   635	          4.1  Honesty In Advertising
   636	
   637	               Over the years, many of us in this shareware business
   638	               have seen many of the sleazy shareware advertisements and
   639	               catalogs touting FREE!, FREE!, FREE! Software.  You don't
   640	               find too many any more as most of those vendors have
   641	               failed or have decided that honesty is the BEST policy. 
   642	               After all, the entire shareware industry is based on
   643	               trust between the author, vendor, BBS and end user.
   644	
   645	               You should prominently display a description of shareware
   646	               and the registration process.  This is also true for Rack
   647	               Vendors.  You must make an attempt to educate your
   648	               customers on the nature of shareware.  You can write this
   649	               information in your own words or use the ASP wording:
   650	
   651	                    "Shareware is an exciting marketing method which
   652	                    allows you to try top-quality software before you
   653	                    pay the author. With Shareware, you cannot be
   654	                    disappointed spending money on a program that's not
   655	                    right for you. The small fee you pay to us covers
   656	                    only the duplication and distribution costs, and
   657	                    permits you to evaluate the program."
   658	
   659	                    "If you continue to use the program, you must send
   660	                    the author an additional payment which may entitle
   661	                    you to technical support, printed manual, bonus
   662	                    programs, and more. Your payment supports the
   663	                    authors, enabling them to continue writing newer and
   664	                    better Shareware programs."
   665	
   666	               This is important in maintaining customer satisfaction. 
   667	               Too often a customer purchases a disk from a vendor only
   668	               to be offended when s/he learns that an additional
   669	               payment is required.  Customers should be fully informed
   670	               before their purchase.
   671	
   672	               Some rack vendors have failed when they were not honest
   673	               up front with the user.  The user thinks the price
   674	               sticker is the ONLY cost of shareware.  They get angry
   675	               when they see the author's registration requirements,
   676	               demand their money back from the store owner and the
   677	               store owner dumps the trouble causing rack.
   678

   685	     4.   Preparing Your Catalog (Continued)
   686	
   687	          4.1  Honesty In Advertising (Continued)
   688	
   689	               Users are not "encouraged to register", they are
   690	               "required to register".  Please do not imply that a user
   691	               registers only if s/he "likes" the product.  Liking the
   692	               product is irrelevant if the user continues using it
   693	               beyond the evaluation period.
   694	
   695	               Registration is required for use beyond evaluation, and
   696	               emphasis should be placed upon the individual author's
   697	               registration requirements.  The user's trial or
   698	               evaluation license is determined by the copyright holder. 
   699	               This is a legal requirement, not an optional formality.
   700	
   701	               Please do not make promises which the authors can not
   702	               fulfill, such as stating that registration always brings
   703	               printed manuals.  Usually this is true, but the actual
   704	               registration benefits depend upon the individual author. 
   705	               Each author has his/her own registration incentives.
   706	
   707	               Actually, the above is a requirement, not just a
   708	               suggestion, for ASP Vendor members.
   709	
   710	               If you throw honesty to the wind, both you and the
   711	               authors will get complaint calls and letters.  Authors
   712	               getting these complaints will almost always recommend
   713	               some other vendor that the author knows believes in
   714	               honesty in advertising.  Another opportunity for failure
   715	               in this business {grin}.
   716	
   717	
   718	          4.2  Use A Good Word Processor
   719	
   720	               There are many excellent shareware word processors that
   721	               will produce excellent looking printed catalogs (be sure
   722	               to register {smile} ).  Or you can use a good non-
   723	               shareware word processor.  There are excellent shareware
   724	               Desk Top Publishing systems if you wish to include screen
   725	               captures in your catalog.
   726	
   727	               If you are preparing an on-disk catalog, almost ALL word
   728	               processors can "print" to a straight ASCII file that
   729	               contains no control characters except a Form Feed (ASCII
   730	               12) after line 59 on each page.  Do not pad blank lines
   731	               to make a full 66 lines per page.  The HP laser printers
   732	               (and compatibles) can handle only 59 or 60 lines before
   733	               they eject the page.

   742	     5.   Hardware
   743	
   744	          5.1  Computers
   745	
   746	               At a minimum, you will need a computer with BOTH 5.25"
   747	               360k and 3.5" 720k disk drives.  These days, a 400m hard
   748	               drive is very reasonable in cost.  You need a good
   749	               computer to review the shareware and public domain
   750	               software that you may place in your catalog.  Get the
   751	               latest and greatest that you can afford.  At the time
   752	               this document was last updated, fast super VGA computers
   753	               with at least 200m hard drive could be purchased in the
   754	               $1,500 (or less) range.
   755	
   756	               You may also want to pick up an old machine with a
   757	               Hercules type monochrome monitor to see if the color
   758	               selections used by an author will give a readable screen
   759	               on an old monitor.  A laptop with LCD display may be
   760	               another good test bench for the same reason.  Some
   761	               authors just don't take the time to shut off color so
   762	               that the program can be used on the older monitors. 
   763	               Naturally many games these days are written for VGA as
   764	               many serious gamers have up to date monitors.
   765	
   766	          5.2  Do NOT Depend On 1.2m Drives
   767	
   768	               You MUST have a TRUE 5.25 inch 360k drive.  You may also
   769	               want a 1.2m 5.25 inch drive, but you MUST have a true
   770	               360k drive to make your 360k disks.
   771	
   772	               Some vendors distribute NO 360k disks anymore as the
   773	               demand is fading.  Hovever, most disk vendors still
   774	               distribute either 360k 5 1/4" or 720k 3 1/2" disks.  A
   775	               few distribute collections on 1.44m 3.5" disks.  Very FEW
   776	               vendors sell 1.2m 5 1/2" disks.  Don't let a computer
   777	               store or mail order outfit tell you that you can make
   778	               360k copies on 1.2m high density drives.  Sure, sometimes
   779	               you can.  Often a customer will NOT be able to read the
   780	               disk.  You will get a LOT of calls from those to whom you
   781	               have sent disks.  It will cause you loss of big bucks,
   782	               lost sales and frustrated customers.  Sort of akin to the
   783	               end of the world for a shareware vendor.
   784	
   785	               Why?  The answer is fairly simple.  To get 1.2m on a
   786	               5.25" disk, the disk drive "paints" a track that is 1/2
   787	               as wide as the 360k drives so it can place 80 tracks on a
   788	               disk rather than 40.  Sure, you can ask the DOS FORMAT
   789	               program to tell your disk drive to lay down only 40
   790	               tracks for a 360k format, but they are still THIN tracks.

   801	          5.2  Do NOT Depend On 1.2m Drives (Continued)
   802	
   803	               If the disk was previously formatted, and often suppliers
   804	               sell pre-formatted disks at no additional price, the
   805	               vestiges of the 80 tracks are STILL there, even though
   806	               your disk drive just wrote a 40 track 360k format onto
   807	               the disk.  A true 360k drive has a WIDER head and will
   808	               easily pick up portions of bits from the adjacent
   809	               unerased thin track that was laid down previously.  The
   810	               360k drive reads garbled data and DOS gives up.
   811	
   812	               Even if you make 360k disks with disks that have NEVER
   813	               been formatted before, the tracks are too thin to be read
   814	               by many 360k drives.  A slightly out of adjustment 360k
   815	               drive can read true 360k disks just fine, but will choke
   816	               on one of those darned disks made on a high density
   817	               drive.
   818	
   819	               This problem does NOT exist with 1.44m 3 1/2" drives. 
   820	               The track width on both the 720k and 1.44m formats is the
   821	               SAME.  Eighty tracks are used for both 720k and 1.44m. 
   822	               The 1.44m format just has twice as many sectors to the
   823	               track.

   860	               You can use the DOS DISKCOPY command to make copies from
   861	               your shareware masters.  If you are not familiar with DOS

   913	     6.   Software
   914	
   915	          6.1  Catalog-On-A-Disk
   916	
   917	               CATALOG-ON-A-DISK (from EmmaSoft Software Company, Inc.)
   918	               makes it easy for your computer-using customers to buy
   919	               from you.  They can browse or search for products and
   920	               order as they go along using only the (Enter) and (Esc)
   921	               keys, arrows and numbers.  The order form is sent to a
   922	               printer or text file, with taxes and shipping calculated,
   923	               to be mailed, faxed, called in, or sent by modem.
   924	
   925	               The program is particularly appropriate for selling
   926	               shareware because all your customers have computers, it's
   927	               a unique and modern way to distribute the catalog, and
   928	               the program itself is shareware.  It's a fast way to get
   929	               a catalog put together, and is less expensive to produce
   930	               than a print catalog.  CATALOG-ON-A-DISK also offers
   931	               unique ways to distribute your catalog.  Businesses
   932	               distribute catalogs on floppy disks, on the hard disks of
   933	               computers they sell, and even have customers download
   934	               catalogs from their BBSs.
   935	
   936	               CATALOG-ON-A-DISK makes buying easy because it is based
   937	               on the (Enter) key to make choices, and the (Esc) key to
   938	               back out.  There are very few keys for the user to find,
   939	               so ordering goes very quickly with no obstacles between
   940	               your customer and your products.  You make your catalog
   941	               files with your favorite text editor, then compress the
   942	               files using the Companion program.  Compressed files fit
   943	               an enormous number of products on a floppy disk.  They
   944	               are read directly into memory - no intermediate file is
   945	               created so it displays fast and pricing and other catalog
   946	               data is secure.
   947	
   948	               You make the catalog screens to best represent your
   949	               company.  Opening Screens display your splash screen,
   950	               tell about the catalog, your products, and your company. 
   951	               The Main Menu displays categories of products.  The
   952	               "Exit" menu is where customers print the order form,
   953	               review an order, or view Special Forms (discount coupons,
   954	               informational text or ordering details).  You can set up
   955	               your own help screens and a help bar.  If your catalog is
   956	               not in English you can translate the program's internal
   957	               text.  Address and date formats can be set for US or
   958	               international use.

   974	               You can also set your catalog to automatically calculate
   975	               sales tax for one, all, or no states or provinces.  You
   976	               can also build shipping options into the catalog, letting
   977	               the customer choose an option so the shipping will be
   978	               calculated into the total on the order form.

  1028	
  1029	          6.2  Compression Software
  1030	
  1031	               It is a challenge for many authors to fit their entire
  1032	               system on one disk.  They often use compression software
  1033	               that can squeeze the files to 50% or less than their
  1034	               original size.  Compression software is always used on
  1035	               Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) to reduce download times and
  1036	               save room on the BBS hard disk drive.
  1037	
  1038	               Phil Katz's PKZIP system is the most widely used
  1039	               compression system.  For BBSs, the author compresses all
  1040	               of the program and documentation files into one ZIP file. 
  1041	               For example the SmuggyWrap shareware (fictitious) Version
  1042	               2.1 may all be ZIPed into a file named SMUGGY21.ZIP. 
  1043	               Some authors send their disks to both BBSs and disk
  1044	               vendors as a single ZIP file.  In this case, your job
  1045	               will be to run PKUNZIP to expand the compressed ZIP file
  1046	               out into the various program and documentation files so
  1047	               that you can evaluate the system.
  1048	
  1049	               It may be the author's intention that you place all of
  1050	               the files in the ZIP (after uncompression) onto a single
  1051	               disk for your shareware distribution master.  Hopefully,
  1052	               the author will communicate this to you with a letter or
  1053	               on-disk instructions.  Authors often have a VENDOR.DOC or
  1054	               VENDINFO.DIZ file for this type of instruction.  Other
  1055	               authors expect you to be a mind reader and this type
  1056	               author often gets few registrations due to poor
  1057	               packaging.
  1058	
  1059	               If you plan to send out shareware disks to your
  1060	               customers, they will need to already have the PKZIP
  1061	               system or you will have to include PKUNZIP.EXE on each
  1062	               distribution disk that contains ZIP files.  Further, your
  1063	               customer will have to figure out how to unZIP the
  1064	               compressed file.  This is a REAL problem for end users. 
  1065	               Those users that already understand how to unZIP a file
  1066	               probably obtain their shareware from BBSs and won't be
  1067	               your customer anyway.  If you include PKUNZIP.EXE on your
  1068	               distribution disks, you will need a license from PKWARE
  1069	               (414-354-8699).
  1070	
  1071	               To solve this end user problem, there is another type of
  1072	               compressed file used by many authors called a "Self-
  1073	               Extract Program".  It is an executable program (.EXE)
  1074	               where the PKZIP software is at the front of the file and
  1075	               the remainder of the .EXE file that is the compressed
  1076	               data (normally in a ZIP file).

  1086	          6.2  Compression Software (Continued)
  1087	
  1088	               When you run this type of program, it uncompresses all of
  1089	               the author's program and documentation files to recreate
  1090	               the original files.  It is the author's responsibility to
  1091	               get a license from PKWARE to send you this self-extract
  1092	               program file.  You do not need to pay any further
  1093	               royalties to PKWARE as the author has already done so.
  1094	
  1095	               Many authors include an INSTALL program or BATch file to
  1096	               properly install the shareware on the users hard drive. 
  1097	               Therefore, you never want to uncompress the self-extract
  1098	               if the INSTALL program is looking for the self-extract
  1099	               files.
  1100	
  1101	               Every disk or rack vendor should get a registered copy of
  1102	               PKZIP.  Call PKWARE at 414-354-8699 to get your
  1103	               registered copy and ask them about royalty arrangements
  1104	               if you wish to send out disks with just the PKUNZIP
  1105	               program.
  1106	
  1107	
  1108	               Another popular compression system is LHA.  It competes
  1109	               very favorably with PKZIP as far as compression rates and
  1110	               (as of this writing) has no royalty requirements.  There
  1111	               are copyright notice requirements that must be followed. 
  1112	               This software is available from most disk vendors and
  1113	               BBSs.

  1257	          6.4  Virus Scanning
  1258	
  1259	               YOU MUST CHECK EVERY DISK that you receive.  Don't trust
  1260	               anything, especially the so-called "retail" shrinkwrapped
  1261	               software.  Shareware authors, BBSs and vendors are
  1262	               routinely careful if they expect to stay in business. 
  1263	               Before you even do a DIRectory of any disk, run your
  1264	               virus scanner software against the disk.  Contact the
  1265	               person that sent you the infected disk as they may not be
  1266	               aware of the infection.
  1267	
  1268	               You may never find a virus.  They actually aren't as
  1269	               common as the press would have you believe.  Second to
  1270	               retail software are the computer repair shops at
  1271	               spreading virus attacks.  Some rarely, if ever, check a
  1272	               disk brought in by a customer that wishes to try out a
  1273	               new computer on the floor.  Some don't check computers
  1274	               that they bring in for repair.  The customer's hard disk
  1275	               could be infected and the repair person can easily infect
  1276	               the test disk used to diagnose the computer.  Every
  1277	               computer checked by that test disk thereafter will be
  1278	               infected.  Some retail computer stores re-shrinkwrap
  1279	               returned software and place it back on the shelf without
  1280	               checking it.  Scary, isn't it?

  1286	               security program.  It provides a single comprehensive
  1287	               solution to assure that all your programs and data are
  1288	               safe.  In addition to scanning for known viruses, it
  1289	               detects unknown viruses and unlike other products will
  1290	               detect files which have been damaged but not infected by
  1291	               a virus.  Integrity Master protects you against all
  1292	               threats to your data and programs not just viruses!  To
  1293	               order with Master or Visa card, call 800-788-0787 or 314-

  1298	               be obtained from the VIRUSFORUM on CompuServe, many BBSs
  1299	               and disk vendors as VIRX.ZIP.  It is only the scanner and
  1300	               will detect over a thousand viri.  If a virus is
  1301	               detected, you are warned so you can send back or destroy
  1302	               the disk being scanned.  However, if you want to remove
  1303	               the virus, you buy a copy of Datawatch's "Virex For The
  1304	               PC" which can be purchased through computer software
  1305	               stores and mail order houses or by calling Datawatch at

  1316	               Many startup shareware disk vendors have little knowledge
  1317	               of the computers they are using.  Further, the people
  1318	               that answer the phones have little knowledge of what they
  1319	               are sending out.  They don't even have the knowledge to
  1320	               tell the user to do a DIRectory of the disk they sent to
  1321	               the user to look for .TXT and .DOC files that can be
  1322	               printed by the user.  They even don't know how to tell
  1323	               the user how to COPY the README type files to the
  1324	               printer.

  1483	     7.   Supplies
  1484	
  1485	          The following information was obtained from messages on the
  1486	          CompuServe ASPFORUM over the years, and information sent to
  1487	          this author by various companies.  This list is by no means
  1488	          complete and you will need to do your own research to decide
  1489	          just where you will obtain your supplies.
  1490	
  1491	          7.1  Diskettes
  1492	
  1493	               There are countless suppliers of disks.  Many (if not
  1494	               most) obtain their disks from Taiwan manufacturers.  The
  1495	               quality of disks can vary widely from one supplier to
  1496	               another.  This document will list no disk suppliers as
  1497	               they seem to come and go due to the highly competitive
  1498	               nature of this market.
  1499	
  1500	               Check computer magazine ads and try 500 or so from
  1501	               several suppliers.  Keep track of the failure rate. 
  1502	               Switch vendors if the failure rate is more than several
  1503	               percent.  Pick a supplier that has a good replacement
  1504	               policy for bad disks.  Make sure they pay the postage if
  1505	               they require that you return the bad disks.  This writer
  1506	               once had 48 disks fail out of one package of 50 disks. 
  1507	               That supplier got blunt phone calls.
  1508	
  1509	               If you pay extra for pre-formatted disks, be sure that
  1510	               your duplication software does a CRC check (DISKCOPY /v)
  1511	               as even pre-formatted disks can have a bad failure rate. 
  1512	               You can't afford the returns when you send out faulty
  1513	               disks.
  1514	
  1515	               Keep up with what is going on in the computer industry. 
  1516	               Subscribe to several computer magazines.  A lot of folks
  1517	               got caught not being able to obtain 3.5" disks in the
  1518	               Spring of 1992 when Microsoft had their Windows 3.1 and
  1519	               DOS 5 and IBM had their OS/2 major upgrades AT THE SAME
  1520	               TIME.  Microsoft and IBM gobbled up every 3.5" disk in
  1521	               sight.  The ASPFORUM was full of panic messages from both
  1522	               authors and vendors that got caught.  This writer was
  1523	               down to only 7 disks while in the middle of a major
  1524	               upgrade on a shareware product.  Normally, you can get
  1525	               almost any quantity in several weeks.  So, be aware! 
  1526	               Don't let your stock of disks get too low.

  1577	          7.3  Label Stock
  1578	
  1579	               With font programs, you can make small quantities of
  1580	               laser labels at a low cost that look like they were
  1581	               custom printed.  Nelson Ford feels that Avery Label Pro
  1582	               is the best laser label program.  Paul Mayer recommends
  1583	               CompUSA for laser labels.  If there is not one near you,
  1584	               you can call them at 817-261-7702 or 800-342-7638.  They
  1585	               accept mail orders through this number by credit card.

  1600	
  1601	               Avery will send you a sample pack of laser labels for the
  1602	               purpose of getting your software to work with them. 
  1603	               Write to them at 777 East Foothill Blvd., Azusa, CA
  1604	               91702-1358 or call 800-541-5507.
  1605	
  1606	               The Computer Label Company, 800-332-4223 (619-322-3030)
  1607	               and MEI, 800-634-3478 (614-481-4417) have good prices on
  1608	               standard 3.5" by 1" labels.  You can also call United Ad
  1609	               Label at 800-423-4643 (714-990-2700) and ask for a free
  1610	               catalog and sample label kit.  They specialize in
  1611	               audio/video labels but they do have both pin-feed and
  1612	               laser sheet labels for 3.5" and 5.25" floppy disks.
  1613	
  1614	               Another good source for labels is Lyben Computer Supplies
  1615	               313-268-8100.  They have the Avery labels.  They are also
  1616	               one of the few suppliers that carry the continuous
  1617	               fanfold label stock that can be used for 3.5" disks.  The
  1618	               labels are 2 3/4 by 1 15/16 inch and are Stock # 0300.
  1619	
  1620	               Almost all types of label stock can be obtained from
  1621	               Quill (see above for address).

  1654	     8.   Trademarks
  1655	
  1656	          Generally, if you start using your company name without a (TM)
  1657	          notice by the name, you lose the trademark protection. So
  1658	          spend the extra four keystrokes and put it on.  The trademark
  1659	          office requires that you send them copies of artwork currently
  1660	          being used with the TM indicated next to your word or phrase. 
  1661	          The patent & trademark office will then issue you a paper
  1662	          telling you that your word or phrase is now a Registered
  1663	          Trademark and then you have the right to use the circled R in
  1664	          place of TM.
  1665	
  1666	          CompuServe has a service called IQuest (GO IQUEST) that will
  1667	          allow you to scan the Trademark Data Base for about $35 to
  1668	          $150 depending on how many ways you search.  The search cost
  1669	          depends entirely on the exact mark and goods involved, how
  1670	          many "hits" come up in the search, etc.  This may a quick way
  1671	          to check on whether or not someone else has already registered
  1672	          your words.  However, the experienced lawyer may well find
  1673	          more information than the novice searcher and save you a lot
  1674	          of problems later.
  1675	
  1676	          The Association of Shareware Professionals currently uses
  1677	          Lance Rose for copyright and trademark advice.  Lance has
  1678	          handled the ASP's lobbying efforts in Washington D.C. and was
  1679	          instrumental in having a bill modified that otherwise would
  1680	          have virtually eliminated any copyright protection for
  1681	          shareware.
  1682	                         Lance Rose
  1683	                         87 Midland Avenue
  1684	                         Montclair  NJ  07042
  1685	                         201-509-1700
  1686	
  1687	          Lance told us that "properly speaking it's not the words
  1688	          themselves that are registered, but the mark at issue for
  1689	          specific goods or services.  The whole question of
  1690	          registration, of course, does not exhaust the issues raised by
  1691	          the question of can I use the mark?  An unregistered trademark
  1692	          won't come up on an IQuest-style search, but the owner of the
  1693	          mark can sue someone who starts using it later.  In this case,
  1694	          neither the registration search, nor registration itself, will
  1695	          keep the second user from getting beaten by the first user. 
  1696	          They will want a copy of your package and need to know the
  1697	          first sale of the product with the "trademark" used."

  1700	          reported paying $200, $700, and over $1000.  However, the $200
  1701	          is impossible these days as the filing fee is now $200.

  1711	     9.   Collecting Shareware
  1712	
  1713	          You need to build a list of the types of shareware you wish
  1714	          for your catalog and you need to collect a list of author
  1715	          addresses.  Where do you get your shareware disks?
  1716	
  1717	               o    From another disk vendor
  1718	
  1719	               o    From BBSs
  1720	
  1721	               o    From large local User Group
  1722	
  1723	               o    From a CD-ROM
  1724	
  1725	               o    FROM THE AUTHOR DIRECTLY
  1726	
  1727	          Guess which this writer considers the best source?  You are
  1728	          right, the authors.  You get the latest and greatest version
  1729	          and will probably be placed on the author's mailing list for
  1730	          updates and new products.  Further, you won't infringe on the
  1731	          "library" or "compilation" copyright of some other vendor.
  1732	
  1733	          If you have no collection at all, you may want to begin
  1734	          creating your subject and author list by purchasing many disks
  1735	          from several other disk vendors.  ONLY use these disks to get
  1736	          the addresses to contact the authors.
  1737	
  1738	          You must look in the authors documentation to learn of any
  1739	          copying restrictions stated by the author.  Under the
  1740	          copyright laws, you may be prevented from distributing
  1741	          additional copies without getting permission from the author. 
  1742	          Some authors place no restrictions on copying and others have
  1743	          very strict restrictions.  YOU must determine this from
  1744	          examining the authors files.  SOME authors require special
  1745	          written permission and SOME require royalty arrangements from
  1746	          rack and CD-ROM vendors even if they sent you the evaluation
  1747	          disk in the first place.
  1748	
  1749	          If you are into BBSs, this may be a good source.  Be SURE you
  1750	          use BBSs that are properly networked with the authors and
  1751	          other BBSs so that you will be downloading current versions of
  1752	          the shareware.  Local isolated BBSs may have very old versions
  1753	          and the author addresses will be out of date.  Again, examine
  1754	          the disks for any author imposed copying restrictions.  Also
  1755	          look for vendor and BBS files that are not part of the authors
  1756	          system that you will want to remove.
  1757	
  1758	          User Groups may also have out-of-date versions and care will
  1759	          need to be taken.  Again, use this as a source to build your
  1760	          author address list so you can contact the authors.

  1768	     9.   Collecting Shareware (Continued)
  1769	
  1770	          CD-ROMs are very expensive to create and some are updated
  1771	          infrequently.  Further, you may not know if the CD-ROM
  1772	          producer made any effort to contact the authors to get either
  1773	          permission to distribute or the latest version.  Before you
  1774	          even consider using a CD-ROM for your source of author
  1775	          addresses, examine the date stamps on the shareware executable
  1776	          program files (.EXE).  If they are older than one year, you
  1777	          know this will not be an up-to-date source of addresses.
  1778	
  1779	          Recently the ASP started supplying their Vendor members with a
  1780	          CD-ROM carrying much of the shareware produced by the ASP
  1781	          authors.  At this writing, it is updated and issued monthly
  1782	          and there is no extra charge for this service.
  1783	
  1784	          After you have created a draft of your catalog, and made your
  1785	          author address list, contact the authors to obtain the
  1786	          shareware.
  1787	
  1788	          If you are a RACK or CD-ROM vendor, let the author know that
  1789	          when you write to them.  If you ALSO are a catalog (printed or
  1790	          on-disk) vendor, let them know that too.  SOME authors will
  1791	          require special permission and SOME may require royalties for
  1792	          you to place their copyrighted shareware on racks or CD-ROMs. 
  1793	          They may or may not require this special contract or royalties
  1794	          for your catalog operation.  These special requirements are
  1795	          the AUTHOR's requirements, not requirements of the ASP or any
  1796	          other trade organization that this author knows of.  The ASP
  1797	          takes NO position on any of these special author requirements
  1798	          or any royalty requirements and offers NO opinion except to
  1799	          warn the vendors that the author's copyrights are legally
  1800	          enforceable.

  1825	          10.  Providing Technical Support
  1826	
  1827	          Hopefully you will have customers that have purchased disks
  1828	          from your library collection.  Note that they are buying your
  1829	          library and disk copying services - NOT the right for
  1830	          unlimited use of the shareware.
  1831	
  1832	          Many of your customers will be first time shareware users. 
  1833	          They will not know how to do a DIRectory of the disk to look
  1834	          for README type files and how to copy them to their printer. 
  1835	          YOU MUST provide some type of instruction to allow YOUR
  1836	          customer to figure out how to find the author's installation
  1837	          instructions.  If the author placed no installation
  1838	          instructions on the disk either place your own instruction
  1839	          file on the disk, or don't carry that disk in your library. 
  1840	          Develop a sheet you can send with each order that will give
  1841	          the novice user getting started instructions.
  1842	
  1843	          Don't get excited, you are not expected to provide support on
  1844	          the author's programs, just on the package YOU sold.  They
  1845	          have to be able to install the author's stuff so they can
  1846	          contact the author for support on the author's programs and
  1847	          documentation.  You are responsible for only the front end of
  1848	          the installation so the user can get to the author's
  1849	          instructions.  Some authors provide little or no instructions
  1850	          on getting their shareware installed and only a dedicated
  1851	          computer nerd could do it.  Just don't sell these disks. 
  1852	          Don't let the author's problems become your problems.
  1853	
  1854	          If you wish to add a general purpose Help program to the
  1855	          shareware disks in your library, take a look at the following:
  1856	
  1857	               Product: Simply Help!
  1858	               Author: SimpleWare, 709-489-3757

  1886	                 Compiler creates EXE files or TSR files with your
  1887	                 choice of hot key.  A library for QuickBASIC 4.xx is
  1888	                 included. Applications include TSR help for existing
  1889	                 programs, catalogs, readme files, manuals, on-line help
  1890	                 for QuickBASIC programs.
  1891	
  1892	               You MUST register Simply Help! if you are going to place
  1893	               ANY files created by Simply Help! on any disk copies you
  1894	               sell.
  1895	
  1896	          You can have an instruction on all disk labels to show how to
  1897	          run your help program created with software like "Simply
  1898	          Help!"  Or, you can print the instruction on the disk sleeves
  1899	          or an instruction sheet sent with each order.  You can't
  1900	          expect your customers to be computer experts.
  1901	
  1902	
  1903	          If you are going to survive in this business, you must list a
  1904	          daytime support number.  You may only need to tell the first
  1905	          time user to read your instructions on starting shareware.  If
  1906	          you get too many calls, your instructions are inadequate and
  1907	          you must improve them.  If you do not provide a "real live"
  1908	          support person, your customers will go elsewhere and you risk
  1909	          going out of business.
  1910	
  1911	          Too many shareware vendors think that this business is an easy
  1912	          fast buck venture.  They think they can make big money
  1913	          operating evenings out of their home.  Like the authors, you
  1914	          can start that way if you are willing to have the money come
  1915	          in slowly at first.  Eventually, you will need at least one or
  1916	          two people working full time reviewing new disks and handling
  1917	          technical support.  You will need another person to handle the
  1918	          orders.
  1919	
  1920	          This is a tough section for many folks wanting to get into
  1921	          this business.  However, it is good advice gathered from many
  1922	          sources and is intended to help you decide if you want to
  1923	          invest further in shareware vending.

  1939	     11.  The Association of Shareware Professionals ("ASP")
  1940	
  1941	          The Association of Shareware Professionals ( ASP is a
  1942	          Registered Trademark ) started with an organizational meeting
  1943	          hosted by Nelson Ford (PSL) on February 27, 1987 in Houston
  1944	          Texas.  Successful authors such as Jim Button (PC-File), Bob
  1945	          Wallace (PC-Write) and Marshall Magee (Automenu), along with
  1946	          major disk vendors like Public (software) Library (PSL),
  1947	          Public Brand Software, PC-SIG, BBS operators, CompuServe
  1948	          sysops and many others participated in this meeting.
  1949	
  1950	          These people could have adopted the attitude that they were
  1951	          already successful enough without such an organization, but
  1952	          they did not.  They paid their own way to the Convention even
  1953	          though they were the featured speakers!  Button was elected
  1954	          the ASP's first (and second) Chairman of the Board of
  1955	          Directors.  Magee became the first President.  None of these
  1956	          are "honorary" positions; they involve a great deal of time
  1957	          and effort.
  1958	
  1959	          The ASP also owes thanks to the sysops of IBMNET on
  1960	          CompuServe.  Sysops Conrad Kageyama and Don Watkins were at
  1961	          the Convention and arranged, on the spot, a place on IBMNET
  1962	          for the shareware authors to meet electronically and continue
  1963	          our plans.  We have been meeting there daily ever since in
  1964	          what must be a record for longest continuous business meeting.
  1965	
  1966	          The ASP has grown into a group of shareware Authors, Shareware
  1967	          Publishers, Disk Vendors, Bulletin Board Systems (BBS), User
  1968	          Groups, Press members and others working together to improve
  1969	          the image and marketability of shareware as an alternative way
  1970	          of purchasing high quality software.
  1971	
  1972	          The shareware marketing concept is just a different way of
  1973	          marketing software.  It is quite different from other forms
  1974	          that usually include the Software Manufacturer, Distributors
  1975	          and Retailers AND a LOT of expensive advertising and mark-ups
  1976	          that often cause prices in the $500-$1000 range.
  1977	
  1978	          The shareware channel consists of 4 distinct groups:
  1979	
  1980	          1.  The shareware Authors who write and hold the copyrights on
  1981	          the software.  Some authors have shareware Publishers to
  1982	          handle the marketing.

  1997	
  1998	          2.  The disk copying services (Vendors) which build and
  1999	          maintain collections of shareware and public domain software,
  2000	          thus providing a convenient source from which users may obtain
  2001	          software for evaluation.  The disk Vendors charge for the
  2002	          disks to make a profit while covering library, advertising and
  2003	          other costs.   User Groups contribute to shareware
  2004	          distribution and are usually not-for-profit providing low cost
  2005	          disk copies for members.
  2006	
  2007	          3.  Bulletin Board Systems (BBSs) which help to distribute
  2008	          software by maintaining libraries of downloadable programs. 
  2009	          BBSs also provide a means for users to communicate with each
  2010	          other, recommending programs, providing technical assistance,
  2011	          reporting problems, and more.
  2012	
  2013	          4.  The software user who is the underlying reason for the
  2014	          existence of groups 1, 2 and 3.

  2016	          What are the benefits of being an ASP member?

  2018	          1.  Author and Publisher members benefit by the user's
  2019	          recognition of the ASP MEMBER logo.  Author and Publisher

  2084	          If you join the ASP as a Vendor Member, your address will be
  2085	          published to all of the ASP authors and the authors are
  2086	          strongly urged to send the ASP vendors their disks.  It is the
  2087	          author's responsibility to send you their disks.  Due to the
  2088	          growth in the numbers of vendors, it became prohibitively
  2089	          expensive for the authors to send their disks to all the ASP
  2090	          vendor members.  Therefore, the authors voted to raise their
  2091	          annual ASP dues to help fund sending a CD-ROM to all ASP
  2092	          vendors.  At this writing, it is sent every month and each CD
  2093	          contains the full collection as submitted by the authors.  It
  2094	          also contains a "delta" sub-directory with all of the
  2095	          additions and changes since the previous ASP CD.
  2096	
  2097	          Included on each CD is the latest on-disk ASP Official Catalog
  2098	          listing over 1,000 shareware products produced by the ASP
  2099	          authors.  The ASP Vendor members also receive the ASP's

  2120	
  2121	                    AT&T has a low cost 800-line service called the
  2122	                    Ready Line which is relatively inexpensive.  For
  2123	                    about 23 cents a minute out of state, about 35 cents
  2124	                    a minute in state (for Texas), you can have a fancy
  2125	                    800 number just like the big boys.  Most of the good
  2126	                    acronyms are already gone, but you should still be
  2127	                    able to come up with something.  At the PsL, our
  2128	                    number is 1-800-2424-PsL, which we think is easy to
  2129	                    remember.  However, we were not able to get anything
  2130	                    like 800-PsL-DISK or 800-SHRWARE, which would have
  2131	                    been better.  Another shareware distributor has the
  2132	                    number 800-IBM-DISK, but IBM clamped down on them
  2133	                    for trademark infringement and they no longer
  2134	                    advertise the number that way, so we suggest that
  2135	                    you not waste time trying to work "IBM" into your
  2136	                    acronym.  The Ready Line 800 number is assigned to
  2137	                    your regular telephone number, so you do not even
  2138	                    have to get a second line, unless you just want to
  2139	                    be able to know for sure if someone has dialed the
  2140	                    800 number.

  2142	                    An AT&T competitor, Sprint, has cheaper rates,
  2143	                    although only time will tell if their service will
  2144	                    match AT&T's.  Sprint's rates are as follows:
  2145	                    $10/month Rates vary with distance and total number
  2146	                    of hours: 0-5 hours: $.2125-$.23 5-25 hours:

  2173	               MC/Visa Merchant accounts can be very difficult for

  2176	               checking account for your business for several years, get
  2177	               to know your branch manager well.  Try them first.

  2179	               If that fails, your next step should be to check ALL your
  2180	               local banks.  It's possible that many of the local banks
  2181	               are processed by the same clearinghouse who sets the

  2228	               The Purpose of This Booklet
  2229	
  2230	               In the past ten years a new approach to marketing
  2231	               computer software has emerged: shareware.  Shareware is
  2232	               relatively small compared to the overall software market,
  2233	               and it is very different.  It has been poorly understood
  2234	               by bankers wishing to evaluate shareware businesses. 
  2235	               This booklet explains the shareware business from the
  2236	               banker's point of view.
  2237	
  2238	               Why Software Is Different
  2239	
  2240	               A computer has two components: the hardware and the
  2241	               software.  The physical machinery comprises the hardware:
  2242	               the main box, various disk drives and circuit boards
  2243	               mounted inside, and the keyboard and monitor connected
  2244	               via cables.  Computer programs comprise the software: the
  2245	               operating system, the word processor, the spreadsheet,
  2246	               the accounting package, the database manager, etc.
  2247	
  2248	               The marketing of computer software poses unique problems. 
  2249	               The value of software is intellectual: it comes from the
  2250	               hundreds-to-thousands of hours spent preparing the
  2251	               program and making sure it works perfectly for all users. 
  2252	               The price of the floppy disks that carry the software is
  2253	               tiny compared to the intellectual value.  This makes the
  2254	               computer software industry similar to the video-movie
  2255	               industry: both have problems with unauthorized copying. 
  2256	               But the problems of computer software are worse: first,
  2257	               most computers have the built-in ability to duplicate
  2258	               software using just one machine. Duplication of movies
  2259	               requires two tape decks placed next to each other.
  2260	               Second, copies of software are perfect duplicates of the
  2261	               original.  With videotape, there is significant and
  2262	               annoying degradation when copying is attempted.
  2263	
  2264	               To combat unauthorized copying, some software publishers
  2265	               attempted to make their software difficult to copy.  This
  2266	               "copy protection" was common in the early days of
  2267	               personal computing.  But publishers have never succeeded
  2268	               in devising a protection scheme that doesn't annoy the
  2269	               legitimate purchaser of the program.

  2283	          12.3 A Banker's Perspective (Continued)
  2284	
  2285	               Today almost all computers have high-capacity ("hard")
  2286	               disk drives onto which all software is copied.  If a user
  2287	               can't copy the software to the hard drive, that user
  2288	               isn't likely to buy the software.  Copy-protected
  2289	               software has almost disappeared from the marketplace.
  2290	
  2291	               Other software publishers have taken the completely
  2292	               opposite approach to the problem: they market their
  2293	               software as shareware. 
  2294	
  2295	               What Is Shareware?
  2296	
  2297	               Shareware is the opposite of copy-protection.  Rather
  2298	               than trying to prevent copying, the software publisher
  2299	               actually encourages the user to make copies and "share"
  2300	               the program with anyone interested.  Complete
  2301	               documentation is placed onto the floppy disk along with
  2302	               the program.  In the documentation there is an
  2303	               explanation of shareware.  Anyone who receives a copy of
  2304	               the program is encouraged to try out the program.  If
  2305	               they like it, they should send payment (usually called a
  2306	               "registration") for the program directly to the
  2307	               publisher. Thus the ability to make perfect copies of the
  2308	               program becomes a tool for marketing the program.
  2309	
  2310	               Note that shareware authors retain a valid copyright to
  2311	               the program.  The author establishes the conditions under
  2312	               which the program may be copied.  The author may also
  2313	               establish a specific amount of time for evaluation of the
  2314	               program, beyond which the user is legally required to
  2315	               either pay the registration fee or stop using the
  2316	               program.  The validity of a shareware program's copyright
  2317	               has been tested and approved by the courts: a Missouri
  2318	               shareware author successfully sued a Texas distributor
  2319	               for violating his conditions for copying.  Also, a
  2320	               shareware author was invited to testify before a U.S.
  2321	               Congressional committee evaluating software copyright
  2322	               law, and the law was reworded to recognize explicitly the
  2323	               existence and validity of shareware.
  2324	
  2325	               Shareware is still a small segment of the whole software
  2326	               industry, but it is growing rapidly.  Annual revenues
  2327	               connected with shareware are estimated to exceed $100
  2328	               million in 1991.

  2341	
  2342	               The Shareware Author's Business
  2343	
  2344	               Most businesses publishing shareware consist of a single
  2345	               person: the author of the program.  Many authors develop
  2346	               programs on evenings and weekends, while retaining a full
  2347	               time job weekdays.  The author invests mostly time and
  2348	               not money: a good program takes many hours to prepare,
  2349	               but it takes at most only a few hundred dollars to
  2350	               market.
  2351	
  2352	               Marketing a shareware product consists simply of placing
  2353	               it into the shareware distribution stream -- transmitting
  2354	               the program to free or low-cost dial-up computers called
  2355	               "bulletin-board systems", transmitting or sending it to
  2356	               nationwide services like Compuserve and Prodigy, and
  2357	               sending copies to companies that catalog and distribute
  2358	               shareware.  If the product is good, enthusiastic users
  2359	               will spread it themselves, so that an initial
  2360	               distribution of a few dozen copies will proliferate into
  2361	               many thousands of copies.  A significant number of those
  2362	               thousands result in registrations (money) sent to the
  2363	               author.
  2364	
  2365	               What are the advantages and disadvantages of shareware
  2366	               marketing?  The disadvantages are that a program takes
  2367	               time to build up sales volume, and the volume will
  2368	               usually be much smaller.  Also, a program must be very
  2369	               good to succeed as shareware.  It might be possible, via
  2370	               skillful marketing and advertising, to fool the public
  2371	               into buying a mediocre program when it's shrink-wrapped
  2372	               on a store shelf.  But the user can try out a shareware
  2373	               program before buying it -- if it's mediocre, the user
  2374	               won't use it and hence won't register it.
  2375	
  2376	               The advantages of shareware are low risk and low
  2377	               overhead.  Through traditional (non-shareware)
  2378	               distribution channels, it takes from $200,000 to $500,000
  2379	               to properly launch a software product.  Markups must be
  2380	               granted to both retail outlets and their supplying
  2381	               distributors, so that the publisher might get only 15% of
  2382	               the retail price, and the author even less.

  2398	
  2399	               Some shareware programs fail: they aren't good enough to
  2400	               generate registrations.  But the author doesn't thereby
  2401	               go bankrupt.  He or she simply loses the modest,
  2402	               out-of-pocket initial disk-and-postage investment.
  2403	
  2404	               There are hundreds of shareware authors who make enough
  2405	               money from shareware to substantially supplement their
  2406	               regular job income.  About 50 authors are making a living
  2407	               from shareware receipts, and have gone full-time with
  2408	               their shareware business.  Many of them can make a
  2409	               handsome profit without even needing to hire anyone else
  2410	               to help out.
  2411	
  2412	               Some shareware businesses grow into full-fledged
  2413	               companies, with dozens of employees and multi-million
  2414	               dollar annual sales.  To reach that level, the author
  2415	               typically supplements the shareware marketing with
  2416	               traditional advertising and dealer distribution.  But
  2417	               even for those companies, the risks are low because the
  2418	               author moves into traditional distribution only after the
  2419	               product is generating significant revenue through
  2420	               shareware marketing.  The expansion is financed via
  2421	               existing profits, rather than venture capital.
  2422	
  2423	               Shareware Businesses and Banking
  2424	
  2425	               Shareware marketing is completely unique -- the only
  2426	               other business with its try-before-you-buy philosophy is
  2427	               Public Television; but Public Broadcasting stations do
  2428	               not enjoy the low overhead that shareware authors do.
  2429	
  2430	               The uniqueness of shareware makes it poorly understood in
  2431	               the banking industry, especially those handling
  2432	               credit-card merchant accounts.  Shareware has some of the
  2433	               characteristics bankers normally associate with poor
  2434	               risk: payments are made almost entirely by mail or
  2435	               telephone, and all but the largest shareware businesses
  2436	               are operated out of the author's home.

  2455	
  2456	               In reality, however, shareware authors are ideal
  2457	               credit-card merchants from the banker's point of view. 
  2458	               Unlike other mail-order businesses in which the customer
  2459	               doesn't see the product until it arrives, with shareware
  2460	               the customer already has the product.  If the customer
  2461	               isn't happy, he or she simply stops using the program,
  2462	               and never pays the author in the first place.  If the
  2463	               customer wishes to defraud the author, he or she simply
  2464	               uses the program and never contacts the author.  Thus,
  2465	               all of a shareware author's paying customers are both
  2466	               happy with the product and honest enough to pay for it. 
  2467	               The level of customer complaints and chargebacks is close
  2468	               to zero.  Credit-card fraud for shareware is
  2469	               non-existent.
  2470	
  2471	               If a banker knows about shareware, he or she should
  2472	               welcome a shareware author's business.  How can a banker
  2473	               identify a bona fide shareware business?  To start, the
  2474	               banker can ask the author for a copy of the program.  If
  2475	               the banker doesn't feel "computer-literate" enough to
  2476	               verify that it's a genuine, non-trivial program, he or
  2477	               she can ask for references.  Many shareware authors are
  2478	               members of the Association of Shareware Professionals
  2479	               (ASP).  The ASP screens applications for membership, to
  2480	               ensure that only legitimate authors of non-trivial
  2481	               shareware are admitted as author-members.  The ASP would
  2482	               be happy to verify any claims of membership -- they can
  2483	               be reached at (616)788-5131, weekdays 8--5 eastern time. 
  2484	               Other prominent authors have chosen not to join the ASP,
  2485	               but their programs are listed in the catalogs of
  2486	               shareware distribution companies such as Public Brand
  2487	               Software, P. O. Box 51315, Indianapolis, IN 46251; or the
  2488	               Public (software) Library, P. O. Box 35705, Houston, TX

  2491	               Shareware Distribution Companies
  2492	
  2493	               Bankers should be aware of another major component of the
  2494	               shareware industry, distinct from the authors: the
  2495	               shareware distribution companies.  These companies take
  2496	               advantage of the fact that copying of shareware is
  2497	               allowed, by providing a cataloguing and distribution
  2498	               service of shareware disks.  Customers of distribution
  2499	               houses are sent lists of available programs, for which
  2500	               they can pay a copying fee of between $1 and $5 per disk.

  2511	          12.3 A Banker's Perspective (Continued)
  2512	
  2513	               There is no business arrangement between authors and
  2514	               distribution houses: authors neither receive any
  2515	               royalties for disks sold, nor do they pay anything for
  2516	               the publicity given them.  Customers understand that they
  2517	               are not paying for the software, but merely for the
  2518	               distribution service.  Most shareware authors allow
  2519	               distributors to handle their programs, because it spreads
  2520	               their programs even further.
  2521	
  2522	               From a banker's point of view, the shareware distribution
  2523	               houses are closer to traditional mail-order businesses. 
  2524	               Their profit margins are much lower than authors',
  2525	               because their overhead relative to revenues is higher. 
  2526	               They must advertise in order to build business.  Some
  2527	               distribution companies haven't charged enough for disks
  2528	               to cover their overhead costs, and have thus gone
  2529	               bankrupt.  But others, such as Public Brand Software and
  2530	               the Public (software) Library, have built solid,
  2531	               profitable, multi-million-dollar companies from shareware
  2532	               distribution.
  2533	
  2534	               A banker wishing to evaluate a shareware distribution
  2535	               company can use many of the usual criteria: length of
  2536	               time in business, size of business, profit sheets, etc. 
  2537	               There are a couple of pointers specific to shareware
  2538	               distribution that can enhance the evaluation: first,
  2539	               companies should be charging at least $3 per disk in
  2540	               order to be profitable.  There can exist "Mom and Pop"
  2541	               outfits, run out of homes, that make some money charging
  2542	               less; but if they try to expand into real businesses,
  2543	               their overhead almost always overwhelms them.  Second, a
  2544	               banker can check the distributor's integrity by asking
  2545	               for a catalog and for advertising copy, to make sure that
  2546	               they are adequately explaining to the customer that they
  2547	               are a shareware distribution service and are not selling
  2548	               the software itself.  If the customers understand what
  2549	               they are getting, the level of complaints and chargebacks
  2550	               will be much less than that of the average mail-order
  2551	               business; if they don't, it will be as much or greater.
