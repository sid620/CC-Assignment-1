     1	So this guy asked me how to get digitized Macintosh™ sounds into a modem, so he
     2	can play them over the phone line during a conversation. Lions roaring when he
     3	calls customer service, that sort of thing...
     4	
     5	The simple answer is, it can’t be done. Most modems don’t have the necessary
     6	digital-analog-converter (DAC) circuit. Voicemail units, like the DoveFax+™, are
     7	another story.
     8	
     9	But every Mac has a DAC built-in! It’s what beeps, boings, and insults you with
    10	Talking Moose™. You just need to connect it to your phone.
    11	
    12	A few months ago, I posted a circuit that would let you connect any Mac™ to
    13	almost any phone circuit. Since then, I’ve been e-mailed countless letters of
    14	thanks (well, more than two). But some folks asked for more:
    15	
    16	“Why can’t it be louder?” “Will it work with stereo sounds in my newer Mac?” “How
    17	can I use it with my home stereo or Walkman™?” “What is the meaning of life, the
    18	universe, and everything?”
    19	
    20	For the answer to most of these questions, read on...
    21	
    22	---------------------------------------------------------------- STEREO? LOUDER?
    23	
    24	Original Macs (most compact models, from the 128 up through the SE™ series) had a
    25	low-current audio output jack: it worked well with an amplifier, but didn’t have
    26	enough oomph [technical term] to drive headphones. So the first circuit I devised
    27	just matched that output to the phone system. It wasn’t particularly loud, but it
    28	worked with any Mac.
    29	
    30	Newer Macs have a more powerful output jack. So I modified the circuit to use
    31	that power to boost the voltage going to the phone. At the same time, I doubled
    32	it so you could use it to pick up both sides of stereo sounds (they’ll be mono on
    33	the other end of the phone line, of course), or to connect your phone to a stereo
    34	amp or tape player.
    35	
    36	Which circuit fits your Mac? You can tell by plugging a pair of headphones into
    37	the back. If they play in stereo with full volume, use Circuit II. If they sound
    38	kind of wimpy, use Circuit I... and don’t leave the phones plugged in.
    39	
    40	---------------------------------------------------------------- CIRCUIT I
    41	
    42	Read this even if you’re building the other version. Some of the descriptions
    43	apply to both.
    44	
    45	You’ll want a circuit like this:
    46	
    47	
    48	 
    49	
    50	
    51	
    52	
    53	
    54	
    55	
    56	
    57	
    58	I’ve included Radio Shack® stock numbers, but you should be able to find
    59	equivalent items at any electronic store or hacker’s closet.
    60	
    61	
    62	PLUG - 1/8" mini plug to fit your Mac. Compact Macs and older Mac II models with
    63	mono output can use a 2-conductor plug, #274-286.
    64	
    65	SWITCH - Any single-pole, double-throw switch. #275-635 is a good possibility, or
    66	you can use knife switches, three-way wall switches, or block switches from the
    67	model train you abandoned when you bought a computer.
    68	
    69	TRANSFORMER - This is the key to the whole thing. It keeps the Mac and The Phone
    70	Company™ from interfering with each other. If you don’t use one, you’ll probably
    71	disable your phone service.
    72	
    73	Any low-power 1:1 audio transformer should work. You can rip one out of that
    74	300-baud modem you’ve been meaning to toss, or get a #273-1374 for under four
    75	bucks.
    76	
    77	(If you get the Radio Shack transformer, cut the Scotch™ tape wrapped around it
    78	to free up the four wires. The wire colors should match the diagram.)
    79	
    80	CAPACITOR - This isn’t necessary for transmitting sound, but it lets you hang up
    81	your phone. Otherwise, the phone system will think the transformer is an active
    82	telephone.
    83	
    84	Get a film or ceramic capacitor rated at least .1 µF at 75 volts. Slightly higher
    85	ratings aren’t a problem. #272-1053 (.1 µF / 200 volts) is a good choice.
    86	Electrolytic capacitors won’t work.
    87	
    88	SPEAKER (optional) - Using the sound output of your Mac disables its internal
    89	speaker. Pull the plug out to turn the speaker back on. Or wire in a substitute,
    90	#40-246 (or any other small low-power speaker, like the one from that 300-baud
    91	modem). It won’t be as loud as the internal speaker, which could be a good thing.
    92	
    93	You’ll also need some hookup wire, to extend the components and reach your
    94	telephone. Use bell wire, #278-1509, or anything else in your basement or on
    95	Radio Shack’s shelf.
    96	
    97	---------------------------------------------------------------- CIRCUIT II
    98	
    99	Build one of these:
   100	
   101	 
   102	
   103	
   104	
   105	
   106	
   107	
   108	
   109	
   110	
   111	
   112	The parts are the same, except the transformers are audio-output stepdown ones,
   113	used backwards. Radio Shack #273-1380 does the job nicely. (You’ll need two of
   114	them, but they’re cheap.)
   115	
   116	The plug should be a stereo “ring-tip-sleeve” one: #274-284 matches newer Macs
   117	and most Walkpersons; use #274-139 for most home stereo amps. Or rip the cord off
   118	a pair of non-functioning headphones.
   119	
   120	I left the switch and speaker off the drawing of this circuit, but you can add
   121	them if you want. You can also leave out one transformer, if you’re dealing with
   122	a mono circuit (but _don’t_ tie the tip and the ring of the plug together; that
   123	can harm your Mac).
   124	
   125	The transformer color codes might change, so follow these simple rules:
   126	
   127	1.     Note how one side of the transformer has two wires, and the other has
   128	three. The two-wire side connects to the Mac. The three-wire side faces the
   129	phone. The middle wire on the three-wire side doesn’t connect to anything.
   130	
   131	2.     Note how white is wired to white, and green is wired to green. Even if you
   132	use transformers with different colors, the two sides of the stereo circuit must
   133	match. Otherwise, stereo sounds will be mangled and mono ones will disappear
   134	entirely.
   135	
   136	---------------------------------------------------------------- CONSTRUCTION
   137	
   138	Both the Mac’s audio output and the standard phone system are low-voltage.
   139	Special wiring techniques aren’t needed.
   140	
   141	Solder or twist the wires together neatly, and insulate the connections with
   142	electrical tape (or even duct tape, Scotch Tape™, or Band-Aids™).
   143	
   144	It doesn’t matter which wires go where on the speaker or capacitor. If you’re
   145	using a stereo plug (circuit II), notice how the middle wire goes to the tip of
   146	the plug, the top wire goes to the ring partway up the plug, and the bottom wire
   147	goes to the plug’s sleeve.
   148	
   149	Follow the color codes, and — if you’re using a switch — make sure the wire from
   150	the Mac goes to the switch’s center connector.
   151	
   152	Put the whole mess in a box to make it look pretty. I used part of an old
   153	intercom: the speaker and switch were already built in.
   154	
   155	---------------------------------------------------------------- CONNECTION
   156	
   157	The Mac end is easy. Plug it into the jack that has a speaker icon, like this
   158	one:  
   159	
   160	
   161	You have a few choices when it comes to the Telephone end.
   162	
   163	
   164	1.	DIRECTLY TO THE PHONE JACK	Open up the jack on your wall (it’s low
   165	voltage). You’ll see at least one red and one green wire, connected to screw
   166	terminals. Connect a wire from the transformer to either of these screws, and
   167	from the capacitor to the other screw.
   168	
   169	2.	DIRECTLY INTO THE PHONE		If you’ve got a standard, non-electronic,
   170	non-memory phone, open it up and trace the wires coming in from the back. They’ll
   171	connect to two screw terminals marked L1 and L2. Connect the two wires from your
   172	circuit to these screws. It doesn’t matter which goes where.
   173	
   174	3.	JUST PLUG IT IN				Get a phone cable like #279-391, with a
   175	standard modular plug on one end and four short wires coming out the other.
   176	Connect the transformer and capacitor to the red and green wires. Then plug the
   177	modular end into any standard phone jack or modular Y-connector.
   178	
   179	4.	FOR MULTI-LINE PHONES 		If your office phones have thick cables and
   180	1A2 multiline connectors (they look like SCSI plugs), get a #43-270 adapter. Then
   181	use method #3, above.
   182	
   183	
   184	Digital phones — found in some office buildings — require a special jack. Look on
   185	the bottom of your office phone. If there’s a “Ringer Equivalent Number” or “REN”
   186	stamped on it, it’s NOT digital and you can use these methods. (Touch-Tone™
   187	phones aren’t necessarily digital.)
   188	
   189	Office telecom managers can help you get the right jack, if they can keep from
   190	laughing uncontrollably when you describe what you want to do.
   191	
   192	--------------------------------------------------------------- OPERATION
   193	
   194	Make a phone call. Play a sound on the Mac.
   195	
   196	If you don’t hear the sound on your telephone handset, flip the switch.
   197	
   198	Set the volume with the Sound Control Panel.

   204	The circuit should work and be safe. I tested both versions (and have built many
   205	for friends) and never had any problems. However, strange things can happen to
   206	Macs, lightning can strike phone lines, and klutzes can burn themselves with
   207	soldering irons. So I don’t guarantee anything.
