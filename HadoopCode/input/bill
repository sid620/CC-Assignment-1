     9	15 years is a surprising amount of time in some ways.
    10	Obviously the PC industry goes back further, but the IBM PC
    11	changed it a lot. It changed the way people thought about
    12	computers.
    13	
    14	BILL GATES :
    15	
    16	It absolutely did. For the IBM PC, the key market was a
    17	hobbyist market. We'd gotten floppy disks, so we'd start to get into
    18	some more serious applications. But, both the power of the machine,
    19	because it was the first 16-bit machine, and the endorsement by IBM of
    20	using a personal computer, and then the critical mass of software and
    21	distribution and peripherals that came along with that, makes it the
    22	biggest milestone in the history of personal computing. It was a sea change.
    23	Of course, one of the big developments around it was that before the IBM-PC
    24	came along, machines were essentially incompatible with each other. In those
    25	first few years, [we saw] the whole notion of how compatible was compatible,
    26	there were many different levels there. And a lot of hardware manufacturers
    27	still felt they had more freedom to deviate a little bit and do things that
    28	couldn't be virtualized by a common software interface.
    29	So, in those first two years a lot of key things were established: the idea
    30	of compatibility; MS-DOS as the primary system as opposed to CP/M-86 or UCSD
    31	P-System which were the prime competitors; and the whole thing about a broad
    32	software industry and using indirect distribution channels. Anyway, it was a
    33	monumental change.
    34	
    35	PC MAGAZINE:
    36	
    37	Let's go back -- go back to that first 1982 PC Magazine
    38	interview. You know, "The Man Behind the Machine." Microsoft was involved
    39	with IBM to what at the time was an unprecedented degree. You had written
    40	software for lots of other machines at that point, not operating systems but
    41	BASICs and things like that. How different was it?
    42	
    43	BILL GATES :
    44	
    45	Well, for IBM it was extremely different because this was a
    46	project where they let a supplier -- a partner, whatever you call us --
    47	shape the definition of the machine and provide fundamental elements of
    48	the machine. When they first came to us, their concept was to do an 8-bit
    49	computer. And the project was more notable because they were going to do
    50	it so quickly and use an outside company. It wouldn't be a high-volume
    51	product. Their charge was to do a home and a very low-end business machine.
    52	They had the Data Master, which was 8085-based at the time, that they felt
    53	was covering part of the business market. Then they had the 5100, the
    54	machine that had both an APL and a BASIC interpreter, which was covering
    55	another part of the business market. So it was sort of a home-down business
    56	machine. And it was a very small team in Boca that wanted to prove that IBM
    57	could do a product, any kind of product, in about an 18-month cycle. And
    58	that was the most novel—that was going to be the novel thing was: could
    59	you work with outsiders, which in this case was mostly ourselves but also
    60	Intel, and do it quickly?
    61	And the key engineer on the project, Lou Eggebrecht, was fast-moving. Once
    62	we convinced IBM to go 16-bit (and we looked at 68000 which unfortunately
    63	wasn't debugged at the time so decided to go 8086), he cranked out that
    64	motherboard in about 40 days. It's one of the most phenomenal projects
    65	because there were very small resources involved and we had to ROM the
    66	BASIC which meant that it was essentially cast in concrete, so you couldn't
    67	make much in the way of mistakes. We actually did this clever thing where for
    68	disk versions of the system, we put enough hooks in the ROM that you could
    69	place reasonably modular parts of the ROM.
    70	So it was very lucky when it turned out about a year after the machine
    71	shipped, there was a floating point bug and the New York Times ran it, we
    72	could just issue a disk that patched out that part of the floating point
    73	package because virtually all the machines that had been shipped were
    74	disk-based,. What I had done was made the dispatch table hookable. It was
    75	a very tricky project because the machine had to boot running only BASIC,
    76	or if it detected a disk, it had to boot with the operating system. And
    77	if only the BASIC came in, the we had to do file management against the
    78	audiocassette. And they insisted that it run in a 48k configuration which
    79	was pretty tricky; we were hoping they'd insist on 64k. Now, it turned
    80	out most people bought 128k versions of the machine.
    81	
    82	PC MAGAZINE:
    83	
    84	Didn't the original machine come out with 16k?
    85	
    86	BILL GATES :
    87	
    88	The cheapest machine you could buy -- yeah you're right,
    89	you're right: if you were cassette only, it was 16. And then if you
    90	got the disk you could be 48. And, it was actually fairly complicated
    91	because the ROM is up in very high memory, that is, it's at a different
    92	segment address. The whole idea of where we use long addresses, where we
    93	use short addresses. The 8086 architecture -- now that we have flat
    94	memory model, people forget that a segmented memory model is a fairly
    95	complex thing to work with. It actually got worse before it got better.
    96	We went to the 286 which was very segment-oriented before we finally got
    97	just straight, linear address space in 1986.
    98	
    99	PC MAGAZINE:
   100	
   101	And not in the operating system until after that.
   102	
   103	BILL GATES :
   104	
   105	That's right.
   106	
   107	PC MAGAZINE:
   108	
   109	That's significant.
   110	
   111	BILL GATES :
   112	
   113	Well, people had written applications to use real addresses --
   114	DOS applications depended on the fact that there was not a level of
   115	indirection: that is that you simply shifted the segment value and added
   116	it in. So we had to keep running Real Mode Applications—I mean today you
   117	can buy an IBM PC and run a Real Mode Application. I mean it'd actually
   118	be interesting to take those applications that shipped with the original
   119	PC and plug them in. I'm pretty sure they'd work. I admit I haven't tried
   120	it. The first applications were an adventure game from us, a typing tutor
   121	from us, and then VisiCalc.
   122	
   123	PC MAGAZINE:
   124	
   125	Yes and Easy Writer.
   126	
   127	BILL GATES :
   128	
   129	Was Easy Writer there at the very beginning? I think it was.
   130	So none of the early applications have successful follow-ons. Now the early
   131	language tools included our BASIC compiler, our FORTRAN, and actually at
   132	those times we offered a PASCAL and a COBOL compiler as well.
   133	
   134	PC MAGAZINE:
   135	
   136	Obviously, back then you were talking about DOS as the standard.
   137	I mean you were telling people to write to MS-DOS, not to go around it to
   138	the hardware and all that. Of course, the programs that became most
   139	successful in those days of the applications, did go around it. IBM
   140	became hardware-dependent, which of course was then copied a lot. Was
   141	that a surprise to you?
   142	
   143	BILL GATES :
   144	
   145	No, not at all. I mean, remember we were the big promoters of
   146	the bit-map graphics. We were really against this there were two video
   147	cards. There was CGA, which we pushed for, unfortunately only got 640 by 200
   148	graphics into it and the palate was limited. It was just at the last minute
   149	they gave us a tiny bit of a palate where color 0 could be mapped to 16,
   150	and colors 1, 2 and 3 had a flip where they could be one set or another.
   151	Anyway, the character cells on the CGA were 8 by 8 so they didn't look
   152	as good as the Character Mode Only card. Because that was actually,
   153	although it didn't have bit-map graphics, what IBM calls All Points
   154	Address (APA) graphics. So it was actually 640 by 350 so the character
   155	cells were much larger and looked a lot better. It was the Display
   156	Writer character cell size. So IBM thought a lot of people would buy
   157	that character mode card, which meant you couldn't do graphs and things.
   158	But the only way to do graphics was to [write code directly to the hardware.
   159	So all our applications that did graphics did that as well. It was only
   160	later that we decided we could provide some high-level services and get
   161	enough efficiency that graphics applications would go through the
   162	operating system.
   163	The definition of what it means to be a graphics application changed.
   164	In the early days it meant you had a mode where a chart would come up.
   165	Like when you ran Lotus 1-2-3, most of the time you were in character
   166	mode, where the scrolling was very fast. Now at days we have processors
   167	that are fast enough to scroll the bit map display and you don't even
   168	think about it. Back then, just scrolling the display in graphics mode,
   169	was noticeably, significantly, painfully slower than scrolling the
   170	display in character mode because you have eight times as many bits
   171	to push around and these processors were quite slow processors.
