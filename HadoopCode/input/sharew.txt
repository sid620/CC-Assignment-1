     3	Sample "boiler-plate" Shareware description and license agreement
     4	for shareware programs.  Replace all occurrences of *PROGRAM*
     5	with your program name.  Replace all occurrences of *COMPANY*
     6	with your name or company name.  Last but not least replace all
     7	occurrences of *$FEE* with your shareware price.

    10	DEFINITION OF SHAREWARE
    11	
    12	Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software
    13	before buying it. If you try a Shareware program and continue
    14	using it, you are expected to register. Individual programs
    15	differ on details -- some request registration while others
    16	require it, some specify a maximum trial period. With
    17	registration, you get anything from the simple right to continue
    18	using the software to an updated program with printed manual.
    19	
    20	Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software,
    21	and the copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific
    22	exceptions as stated below. Shareware authors are accomplished
    23	programmers, just like commercial authors, and the programs are
    24	of comparable quality. (In both cases, there are good programs
    25	and bad ones!) The main difference is in the method of
    26	distribution. The author specifically grants the right to copy
    27	and distribute the software, either to all and sundry or to a
    28	specific group. For example, some authors require written
    29	permission before a commercial disk vendor may copy their
    30	Shareware.
    31	
    32	Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software. You
    33	should find software that suits your needs and pocketbook,
    34	whether it's commercial or Shareware. The Shareware system makes
    35	fitting your needs easier, because you can try before you buy.
    36	And because the overhead is low, prices are low also. Shareware
    37	has the ultimate money-back guarantee -- if you don't use the
    38	product, you don't pay for it.

    40	DISCLAIMER - AGREEMENT
    41	
    42	Users of *PROGRAM* must accept this disclaimer of warranty:
    43	"*PROGRAM is supplied as is.  The author disclaims all
    44	warranties, expressed or implied, including, without limitation,
    45	the warranties of merchantability and of fitness for any purpose.
    46	The author assumes no liability for damages, direct or conse-
    47	quential, which may result from the use of *PROGRAM*."
    48	
    49	*PROGRAM* is a "shareware program" and is provided at no charge
    50	to the user for evaluation.  Feel free to share it with your
    51	friends, but please do not give it away altered or as part of
    52	another system.  The essence of "user-supported" software is to
    53	provide personal computer users with quality software without
    54	high prices, and yet to provide incentive for programmers to
    55	
    56	
    57	continue to develop new products.  If you find this program
    58	useful and find that you are using *PROGRAM* and continue to use
    59	*PROGRAM* after a reasonable trial period, you must make a reg-
    60	istration payment of *$FEE* to *COMPANY*.  The *$FEE*
    61	registration fee will license one copy for use on any one
    62	computer at any one time.  You must treat this software just like
    63	a book.  An example is that this software may be used by any
    64	number of people and may be freely moved from one computer
    65	location to another, so long as there is no possibility of it
    66	being used at one location while it's being used at another.
    67	Just as a book cannot be read by two different persons at the
    68	same time.
    69	
    70	Commercial users of *PROGRAM* must register and pay for their
    71	copies of *PROGRAM* within 30 days of first use or their license
    72	is withdrawn.  Site-License arrangements may be made by con-
    73	tacting *COMPANY*.
    74	
    75	Anyone distributing *PROGRAM* for any kind of remuneration must
    76	first contact *COMPANY* at the address below for authorization.
    77	This authorization will be automatically granted to distributors
    78	recognized by the (ASP) as adhering to its guidelines for
    79	shareware distributors, and such distributors may begin offering
    80	*PROGRAM* immediately (However *COMPANY* must still be advised so
    81	that the distributor can be kept up-to-date with the latest
    82	version of *PROGRAM*.).
    83	
    84	You are encouraged to pass a copy of *PROGRAM* along to your
    85	friends for evaluation.  Please encourage them to register their
    86	copy if they find that they can use it.  All registered users
    87	will receive a copy of the latest version of the *PROGRAM*
    88	system.
