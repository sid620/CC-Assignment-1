    22			   Inside Virtual Reality
    23	     (The Myth of Transparency and the Myth of Reflection)
    24	
    25	
    26	      A couple of weeks ago I spent two minutes inside a virtual
    27	 reality.  I put my hand into the dataglove, the heavy, hardwired
    28	 goggles were lowered over my head--and suddenly I was through the
    29	 screen and into a computer-generated environment.  A checkerboard
    30	 plain surrounded by a green field stretched to a blue horizon.  When I
    31	 turned my head, I could see the rest of my computer-animated world:
    32	 red pyramids and yellow columns, a floating grey box, a toy car and
    33	 airplane, a balloon overhead.  Responding to the movements of my hand
    34	 inside the dataglove, my virtual hand, yellow, disembodied, floated in
    35	 front of me.  Pointing with my index finger made me to fly to an
    36	 object.  I could grab the car or the plane and move it to a new
    37	 position.  Or look up at the balloon overhead, point to it, and fly
    38	 upt, the checkerboard plain receding below me.  I flew through the
    39	 balloon into an unseen cityscape.   Out of the balloon, arcing over
    40	 the more familiar plain and back down to the solid surface of my
    41	 virtual world.
    42	
    43	      I took this trip at a press conference before a lecture and
    44	 demonstration advertised as "FROM PSYCHEDELICS TO CYBERSPACE."  The
    45	 show, April 30 at NYU's Loeb Student Center, featured Sixties LSD guru
    46	 Dr. Timothy Leary, author and conspiracy-theorist Robert Anton Wilson,
    47	 and the first public demonstration of Virtual Reality (VR) technology
    48	 on the East Coast.  I had been fascinated with the concept for months,
    49	 and when I heard this road-show was coming with the real equipment, I
    50	 made sure I got to try it.
    51	
    52	      Virtual Reality (sometimes called artificial reality or
    53	 Cyberspace) is hardware and software that puts you inside a
    54	 computer-generated graphic world.  The goggles (or "eyephones")
    55	 position two TV monitors before your eyes, aligned to create a 3-D
    56	 stereoscopic image.  When you turn your head to "look around," your
    57	 head movements are tracked electronically and the computer alters the
    58	 image before your eyes accordingly.  The illusion--the experience--is
    59	 of a complete, 360-degree environment you can look around at and move
    60	 through.
    61	
    62	      After two minutes of tooling around in VR I was pretty spaced
    63	 out.  (That is the correct term.)  But I felt proud and ripe for the
    64	 future when Eric Gullichsen, President of the SENSE8 Corporation of
    65	 Sausalito, CA, whose equipment this was, told me I was a good pilot.
    66	 Gullichsen is a demure and clear-speaking 30- something young man with
    67	 a scraggly beard and a very long blonde ponytail.
    68	
    69	      Recent VR systems required half-million-dollar computers to drive
    70	 their software; Eric's "Desktop Virtual Reality" prototype is run by a
    71	 Sun Sparkstation, a $12,000 dollar computer now selling as fast as the
    72	 top-end Macintosh, and which Eric predicts will be down to $5000 by
    73	 the end of the year.  [5/13: A woman at SENSE8 says Sun announced last
    74	 week it was dropping the price of the Sparkstation by $5-6000.]  The
    75	 dataglove he uses gives an even better idea of how fast this stuff is
    76	 moving out of the lab and into our lives.  A year ago, Eric's demos
    77	 used a prototype that cost $8000.  Now he works with a
    78	 "Powerglove"--made by Mattel for Nintendo.  It sells for $79.
    79	
    80	      Even with a lot of power behind it, SENSE8's VR is about as slow
    81	 and low-resolution as it can be to work at all.  But you still get a
    82	 sense of the possibilities.  It's not so much that the experience
    83	 doesn't live up to the hype:  more that the experience is hard to
    84	 connect with the amount and variety of hype.
    85	
    86	      Doing It was brief, unique, somewhat ineffable.  The hope,
    87	 hysteria and hypotheses that have arisen out of the concept of VR is
    88	 what the rest of the event at NYU was all about: several hours of
    89	 dreams and visions, tech-talk and peptalk on what this stuff is for
    90	 and what it will do.  My two-minutes' experience aside, you can't help
    91	 but feel Something's Up, just from the assortment of strange
    92	 characters and corporations clammoring to jump, or at least keep an
    93	 eye, on the VR bandwagon.
    94	
    95	      Representing psychedelics at the "From Psychedelics to
    96	 Cyberspace" show was Dr. Timothy Leary, the former Harvard Prof.  and
    97	 Acid-activist, now willing to commit his career-long utopian dreams to
    98	 this straight, labcoat technology.  (The work of nerds!) Age 70, he
    99	 comes bounding on stage, energetic and radiant, in brand-new white
   100	 Adidas and a sharp suit sporting a "Just Say Know" button (for sale,
   101	 $2).  His ramblings have slowed, but you still have to pay attention
   102	 to follow the playful and curious threads of his thinking.  Among many
   103	 other things, he's here to contend that 90-percent of the engineers
   104	 and programmers creating the current personal-computer revolution are,
   105	 like Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs (the founders of Apple Computers),
   106	 veterans of psychedelics.  That Silicon Valley is a stone's throw from
   107	 Berkeley and the Haight, he says, is no coincidence.
   108	
   109	      Technology (of all things) is allowing Leary to speak in a new
   110	 and more accessible way about the benefits of altered consciousness.
   111	 He thinks the experience of these computer- generated realities breaks
   112	 down the "straight" idea of a Real World or an Absolute Reality as
   113	 much as the LSD experience did--but without the stigma of "Drugs,"
   114	 which has always prevented Leary's theories from being taken
   115	 seriously.  Instead of sounding like a chemical prophet, he's talking
   116	 about technology and innovation and competition, almost like some Lee
   117	 Iacocca-type on TV, "Working to make America great again."
   118	
   119	      During the show, Leary was the first to demonstrate the goggles
   120	 and glove.  He was strapped in by Gullichsen, then took off, twisting
   121	 his wired head around, giggling, and squirming in his chair as he
   122	 glanced, pointed and flew through his imaginary world.  "Whoa-ho,"
   123	 came his self-mocking laugh, "I've been here before!"
   124	
   125	      "PSYCHEDELICS TO CYBERSPACE" pulls virtual reality into the realm
   126	 of drugs, and also into the world of Science Fiction:  "Cyberspace" is
   127	 sci-fi writer William Gibson's word for his conception of VR.  Gibson
   128	 posits the ultimate interface--what he calls being "jacked in": a
   129	 direct link from machine wires to human nerves and brain.  In the
   130	 world revealed in his 1984 novel Neuromancer, Gibson's characters can
   131	 jack into cyberspace--a computer-generated visually abstracted matrix
   132	 of information--or into the live or recorded senses (the "sensorium")
   133	 of another person.
   134	
   135	      Gibson's vision, and his role in the development of the concept
   136	 and consequences of VR, is taken very seriously; his name comes up in
   137	 every VR speech, and the scientists talk like he's one of the boys.
   138	 Gibson's idea of a direct interface is beginning to happen (in work
   139	 with damaged hearing, experimenters are connecting microphones
   140	 directly to auditory nerves); current VR technology is not direct, but
   141	 tries to make the human-computer interface transparent (that is,
   142	 perceived as direct).  The effect is to put "you" (some part of you,
   143	 some ratio of your senses) into an artificial world that you can
   144	 actually move through and operate within.
   145	
   146	      "Artificial Reality"--the first term used to describe computer
   147	 and video environments--was coined by author-inventor-engineer Myron
   148	 Krueger in the early Seventies, and is the title of his seminal book
   149	 on the subject.   Written in 1972 but not published until a decade
   150	 later, Krueger's Artificial Reality presented all the major concepts
   151	 guiding today's VR investigations, including the idea of a dataglove.
   152	
   153	      Krueger, hailed by all present as the "Father of Artificial
   154	 Reality," was the first speaker.  "I feel a little like Rip Van
   155	 Winkle," he said, "except that it's the rest of the world that's been
   156	 asleep for 20 years."  A good-looking, square-jawed, clear- eyed
   157	 American, he could be your milkman or your mayor, or your math
   158	 teacher.  He has the down-to-earth practicality of someone who, in his
   159	 words, "knits computers," but he too talks about science fiction's
   160	 role in real-world breakthroughs:  "I don't read as much now, but when
   161	 I was younger I read everything.  I used to believe it when someone in
   162	 this field said they hadn't read science fiction; I used to believe
   163	 it, but I don't anymore.  I don't think it's possible."
   164	
   165	      Conspicuously absent was the best known and most publicized of
   166	 the VR pioneers:  Jaron Lanier, a 29-year old white rasta and high-
   167	 school drop-out distinguished by his long dreadlocks and his NASA
   168	 contracts.  He makes the most mystical claims for VR, which might not
   169	 be taken seriously were he not ahead of everyone in VR software and
   170	 hardware and working for the government.  Jaron (everyone here invokes
   171	 the demi-diety on a first-name basis) sees VR having therapeutic,
   172	 ritual uses--in the way of psychotropic drugs in shamantic tribes.  A
   173	 recent Wall Street Journal article on Lanier offered these brave but
   174	 tentative subheads: "COMPUTER SIMULATIONS MAY ONE DAY PROVIDE SURREAL
   175	 EXPERIENCES," and, "A KIND OF ELECTRONIC LSD?".
   176	
   177	      You get a sense that Leary and Wilson are hitching their old
   178	 messages to The Next Big Thing.  But, in fact, the connections they're
   179	 making hold remarkably well.  One message is that VR does what
   180	 psychedelic drugs do.  Another message is political:  how electric
   181	 communication will break down the fascist control of centrist
   182	 governments.  "It was electrons," Leary says, "that brought down the
   183	 Berlin Wall".
   184	
   185	      Politics, drugs, science fiction, philosophy, and mysticism are
   186	 just a few of the fields and factions inspiring and being inspired by
   187	 the cutting-edge technology and scientist-inventors of Virtual
   188	 Reality.  The range of these factions parallels the range of
   189	 implications of the concept:  When consciousness is extended by
   190	 electronics, science and philosophy are in the same room, and there
   191	 are ramifications everywhere in between.
   192	
   193	      Leary, Wilson and Gullichsen each referred to VR as part of an
   194	 electronics revolution that will change television from a passive to
   195	 an active medium--the Viewer will no longer be in the thrall of the
   196	 broadcast monopolies, whose centralized control stems from the current
   197	 state of TV technology (i.e., TV is cheap to receive, but only a
   198	 government or big corporation can afford to produce and broadcast).
   199	 That's changing, with cheap VCRs and portable cameras; with cable, and
   200	 especially fiber-optic cable, which will increase television's
   201	 interfaces with computers.  All of these new forms (including, soon,
   202	 VR) give the individual more control and choice as to how to use the
   203	 medium.  Strictly speaking, "Television" as a medium is visual
   204	 electronic information; your Mac is as much a TV as your Sony.
   205	 Television will no longer be just a receiver for a centralized
   206	 broadcast medium, but one component of an interactive, computer-based
   207	 communications network.
   208	
   209	      "VR is a network like the telephone, where there is no central
   210	 point of origin of information," Jaron stated in a recent interview in
   211	 the Whole Earth Review.  "Its purpose will be general communication
   212	 between people, not so much getting sorts of work done."  He's already
   213	 created a "Reality Built for Two" (RB2), a virtual space in which two
   214	 people interact.
   215	
   216	      Virtual reality is like the telephone medium, which opens a new
   217	 realm for human interaction but doesn't affect the content, i.e., what
   218	 you talk about.  The technology of VR per se has nothing to do with
   219	 what you create or do within it.  But whenever I explain the concept
   220	 of VR to people, they have strong reactions to it.  Fear is common, a
   221	 kind of Brave New World/1984 paranoia.  A professor I described this
   222	 stuff to waxed rhapsodic about how it signals the end of the
   223	 mind-brain duality, creating a sort of spiritual or mystical
   224	 materialism.  (John Barlow has published an article on VR called Being
   225	 in Nothingness.)  Leary and Wilson look into VR and see a
   226	 technological utopia.  Others dream of its pornographic
   227	 possibilities--virtual sex-partners.  A visionary- rebel like Lanier
   228	 is drawn to mystical ends; as the Wall Street Journal observed, "[His]
   229	 obsession with Artificial Reality seems to reflect his dissatisfaction
   230	 with conventional reality."
   231	
   232	      These are all understandable human reactions.  Every new medium
   233	 works like a mirror, reflecting back some part of ourselves.  (The
   234	 telephone, in this sense, "reflects" our speech and hearing.) VR is a
   235	 mirror that reflects our entire consciousness--which might explain
   236	 some of the extreme reactions it's eliciting.  These reactions reveal
   237	 something of the general resonance of the new medium, but more than
   238	 anything specific about what VR does, these reactions reveal us.
   239	
   240	      Marshall McLuhan addressed this phenomenon in Understanding Media
   241	 (1964), labelling it "Narcissus as Narcosis."  In the myth, Narcissus
   242	 falls in love with his own image, unaware that it is his reflection.
   243	 He is numb or blind to an extension of himself, and remains unaware of
   244	 the medium operating on him, in this case, a reflecting pool.  With
   245	 any new medium, we are entranced by its content--which is an extension
   246	 or reflection of some part of ourselves--but remain numb or blind to
   247	 the operation of the medium itself.  We are able to look through or
   248	 conceive into a mirror because it extends our sense of sight--but it
   249	 is impossible for us to focus on or perceive the surface of a mirror
   250	 (the place where its technology is operating) as a two-dimensional
   251	 plain.
   252	
   253	      The thinking of McLuhan (who was dubbed "the Media Guru" around
   254	 the same time in the Sixties when Leary was being accorded guru-status
   255	 for his work with psychedelics) lurks at the edges of a lot of the
   256	 ideas VR is inspiring.  Like Gibson's, his name came up several times;
   257	 Gullichsen quoted McLuhan--"In the future we will wear our nervous
   258	 systems outside our bodies"--as a preface to demonstrating his
   259	 data-goggles and glove.  And Leary later mentioned and gave a good
   260	 illustration of McLuhan's best-known maxim, The Medium Is the
   261	 Message:  "When Moses came down from the mountain with the Word of God
   262	 carved into those marble tablets, let me tell you, boys and girls,
   263	 those were not suggestions...."
   264	
   265	      McLuhan prefigured the electronic extension of consciousness more
   266	 than 25 years ago:  "Having extended or translated our central nervous
   267	 system into the electromagnetic technology, it is but a further stage
   268	 to transfer our consciousness to the computer world as well.  Then, at
   269	 least,  we shall be able to program consciousness in such wise that it
   270	 cannot be numbed nor distracted by the Narcissus illusions of the
   271	 entertainment world that beset mankind when he encounters himself
   272	 extended in his own gimmickry."
   273	
   274	      All the reactions to VR (the "Narcissus illusions") say nothing
   275	 about how this particular mirror works or why our brains are able to
   276	 conceive into and make from this mass of electronic information a
   277	 space that is perceived as real.
   278	
   279	      VR technology does not create "reality" in any sophisicated way;
   280	 in fact, it works in the most unsophisticated way, revealing to us our
   281	 simplest perceptual illusions.  The "space" one enters during the VR
   282	 experience is not visually sophisticated; rather it takes advantage of
   283	 our inclination to conceive three-dimensional space out of two
   284	 dimensions.  In the West, we have been trained to see depth in the
   285	 simplest two-dimensional drawings if the lines of perspective are
   286	 right.  We perceive depth in a line-drawing of a cube (the classic
   287	 "optical illusion"), but this is a relatively recent technical
   288	 development (perspective drawing is a Renaissance invention).  The
   289	 effect will not work in a tribal society whose visual perceptions have
   290	 not been trained in this way.
   291	
   292	      Myron Krueger:  "What VR does is highlight the status of
   293	 artificial experience which we already have lots of."  Jaron Lanier:
   294	 "The reason the whole thing works is that your brain spends a great
   295	 deal of its efforts on making you believe that you're in a consistent
   296	 reality in the first place.  What you are able to perceive of the
   297	 physical world is actually very fragmentary.  A lot of what your
   298	 nervous system accomplishes is covering up gaps in your perception.
   299	 In VR this natural tendency of the brain works in our favor.  All
   300	 variety of perceptual illusions come into play to cover up the flaws
   301	 in the technology."
   302	
   303	      Entering SENSE8's "flawed" virtual reality on April 30, 1990, was
   304	 the culmination of an exactly nine-month gestation period whose
   305	 conception was my first encounter with the idea of electronically
   306	 extended consciousness in the real world.  From then on it was as
   307	 though I was being bombarded by the concept, and from so many diverse
   308	 angles that it was impossible to ignore.  It started on August 1,
   309	 1989, when I read an article in the "Science" TIMES about a device
   310	 called a teleoperated robot.  The operator of the robot moves two
   311	 mechanical arms that move, remotely, a robot's arms.  A helmet covers
   312	 the operator's head, with speakers by his ears and two small video
   313	 monitors before his eyes--with which he "sees" and "hears" via the
   314	 video-camera eyes and microphone ears on the robot's head.  The
   315	 technology allows delicate and dangerous work (like disarming a bomb)
   316	 to be done from a safe distance.  The term "telepresense" has been
   317	 coined for the perceptual illusion:  "The closer you come to
   318	 duplicating the human experience, the more easily your mind transposes
   319	 into the zone as though you were there," operators say.  "You forget
   320	 where you are."
   321	
   322	      "Telepresence" got me, and the idea that "your mind transposes
   323	 into the zone as though you were there."  This was the first real
   324	 example I'd come upon of what McLuhan had predicted more than 25 years
   325	 ago, the electronic extension of consciousness or electronic direct
   326	 experience.  (Like VR, telerobotics puts your consciousness
   327	 elsewhere.)
   328	
   329	      Shortly after, a Seattle computer-jock friend of mine asked if
   330	 I'd heard about Virtual Environments, and it was from him that I first
   331	 learned of the goggles and glove and suit you could wear to see in and
   332	 move around a computer-generated space.
   333	
   334	      The next time I encountered the idea was in the unexpected
   335	 context of an interview with Jerry Garcia in ROLLING STONE (Nov.  30,
   336	 1989).  "Have you heard about this stuff called virtual reality?" the
   337	 lead-guitarist for the Grateful Dead asked his interviewer.  He went
   338	 on to describe the idea quite cogently, and also to connect it with
   339	 psychedelics:  "You can see where this is heading:  You're going to be
   340	 able to put on this thing and be in a completely interactive
   341	 environment...And it's going to take you places as convincingly as any
   342	 other sensory input.  These are the remnants of the Sixties.  Nobody
   343	 stopped thinking about those psychedelic experiences.  Once you've
   344	 been to some of those places, you think, 'How can I get myself back
   345	 there again but make it a little easier on myself?'"
   346	
   347	      Then I was given Neuromancer--Gibson's sci-fi novel (and I've
   348	 never liked sci-fi) that introduces and explores "Cyberspace"--and a
   349	 copy of the interview with VR-pioneer Jaron Lanier.  Reading Gibson
   350	 and Lanier at once, I was startled by how close sci-fi and fact had
   351	 become.
   352	
   353	      Appropriately, it was via ECHO, a new computer bulletin-board,
   354	 that I found out about "From Psychedelics to Cyberspace."  I'd joined
   355	 ECHO a couple of weeks before; getting a modem and entering the world
   356	 of telecommunication transformed my computer from a typewriter to a
   357	 tool for putting ideas online in real-time, a new medium for
   358	 conversing with a group of unseen others, like me, typing down the
   359	 telephone lines.
   360	
   361	      VR is the beginning of another new medium for human
   362	 communication--huge amounts of processed digital information used to
   363	 create the bare-bones of what our brains perceive as "reality." What's
   364	 new is that this realm of information is encountered as experience.
   365	 The content of the telephone medium is speech; the content of the
   366	 television medium is movies and drama and talking- heads: with the
   367	 telephone or TV, you are aware of the inside and the outside--of the
   368	 medium and its limits, and of the real world that surrounds it.  The
   369	 TV or telephone experience does not exist separate from its entrancing
   370	 content (which is itself a different medium, what McLuhan calls "the
   371	 juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar to distract the watchdog of
   372	 the mind").  In VR, there is no such duality.  You know it's not
   373	 "real," and when the perceptual illusion works, you are just Being
   374	 There.  The content of virtual reality is not speech or action or any
   375	 other visual or auditory medium.  The content of VR is consciousness.
   376	
   377	      This sets up a basic question about the difference between
   378	 information and experience.  Information--the kind that comes from
   379	 other people or books or movies or TV--is mediated experience.  It is
   380	 not like the Real World--the real, direct experience of things that
   381	 surround us.  VR is also information, but it is perceived as
   382	 immediate; that is, it is not mediated or digested or translated-- it
   383	 is just "lived."  If "experience is the only teacher," it was the
   384	 experience of psychedelics that taught many people, in a profound and
   385	 direct way, the limits of "reality."  The experience of VR can teach
   386	 that too, and many other things.
   387	
   388	      Playing a video-game or reading a book or watching TV or a movie,
   389	 there are times when you are unconscious of the medium, when you are
   390	 immersed in its content (when "the watchdog of the mind" is chewing
   391	 that meat).  At other times you are aware of the television or the
   392	 book's boundaries.  Within a virtual reality, there is no such losing
   393	 and regaining awareness of your state.  You are aware of its unreality
   394	 and perceive its reality at the same time and all the time.  In fact,
   395	 in VR you have a heightened awareness of perceiving reality in an
   396	 unreal system.  Your consciousness it at once the perceiver of VR, and
   397	 its content.
   398	
   399	      All of which is thrilling to ponder.  But if this stuff is going
   400	 to develop on a mass scale, it has to get there via some marketable,
   401	 real-world applications.  Many people think VR will be carried through
   402	 this intermediate phase by applications in pornography, as was the
   403	 case with the VCR less than ten years ago.  (Add some sort of
   404	 force-feedback or tactile response system, and every sort of inter-,
   405	 trans- and multi-sexual interaction could be programmable: safe sex,
   406	 indeed.)
   407	
   408	      Krueger and Gullichsen, guys on the practical, hands-on, I-
   409	 need-funding side, are working to come up with simple, high-concept
   410	 applications that even America's short-sighted venture capitalists can
   411	 understand.  This sets up some strange situations (since they are
   412	 courting business partners but depend on frontmen like Leary to bring
   413	 in the crowds and press), like when these older corporate guys in
   414	 suits arrive en masse to check-out Gullichsen's gear.
   415	
   416	      They look like money; like their good graces could shower SENSE8
   417	 with contracts and options.  They struggle with the eyephones and the
   418	 glove.  They did not grow up with TV--they are not good pilots.  Eric
   419	 is deferential and cogent and clear, trying to dispel with his manner
   420	 any doubts his long blonde ponytail and rough beard might cast.  And
   421	 then the suits have to sit through the lecture, surrounded by
   422	 college-age Trekkies and every stripe of New Age huckster (a man
   423	 selling "psycho-active soda" for three dollars a cup), and listen to
   424	 Leary and Wilson make fun of Bush, Quayle and the drug-addict Drug
   425	 Czar.
   426	
   427	      Gullichsen does his best to talk toward the most mundane
   428	 applications:  Imagine an architect showing a client around a
   429	 "virtual" building (it's been designed but not built).  The client
   430	 wants to see how it looks with bigger windows, so the architect, in
   431	 the virtual world, can reach over and enlarge the windows with his
   432	 hands.  Another area he talks about is education--the Defence
   433	 Department's use of VR in fighter-pilot training is probably the most
   434	 sophisticated form now in practical use.  A related application, the
   435	 first one we're likely to see, is in entertainment, VR video-arcade
   436	 games.
   437	
   438	      Krueger has one device that's so basic and useful, it seems
   439	 inevitable.  Simply put, it allows you to use your unencumbered hands
   440	 to do anything a mouse does--access menus, draw pictures, move text,
   441	 etc.  (Of course, this isn't VR, you don't put goggles on and put your
   442	 head inside.  But it should make Krueger rich while he waits for the
   443	 technology of the goggles, and the 3-D imaging and computers that run
   444	 them, to catch up to his ideas.)
   445	
   446	      Leary, not surprisingly, flies off into the future, imagining VR
   447	 as some kind of holographic telephone. "You'll call up your friend Joe
   448	 in Tokyo and say, Where do you want to meet today? and press some
   449	 buttons and the two of your are strolling in Hawaii, or meeting in a
   450	 cafe in Paris or on top of Everest, or joining Aunt Ethel for tea in
   451	 Idaho."
   452	
   453	      Jaron Lanier seems to have the most developed ideas about how VR
   454	 will function and where it will be relevant.  He talks about
   455	 handicapped people experiencing full-motion interaction with other
   456	 people, and tele-operated mircorobots performing surgery from within
   457	 the human body.  But he also builds on Leary's dreams of the
   458	 therapeutic uses of psychedelics as tools for exploring the
   459	 unconscious mind.
   460	
   461	      "Idealistically, I might hope that VR will provide an experience
   462	 of comfort with multiple realities for a lot of people in western
   463	 civilization, an experience which is otherwise rejected.  Most
   464	 societies on earth have some method by which people experience life
   465	 through radically different realities at different times, through
   466	 ritual, through different things.  Western civilizations have tended
   467	 to reject them, but because VR is a gadget, I do not think that it
   468	 will be rejected.  It's the ultimate gadget.
   469	
   470	      "It will bring back a sense of the shared mystical altered sense
   471	 of reality that is so important in basically every other civilization
   472	 and culture prior to big patriarchal power.  I hope that that might
   473	 lead to some sense of tolerance and understanding." Jaron envisions
   474	 the VR experience, potentially, functioning like an Amazonian
   475	 shamantic drug ritual for the electronically re- tribalized Global
   476	 Village.
   477	
   478	      When considering these predictions and dreams, it's important to
   479	 remember the stage all of this is at.  People at the show were asking
   480	 how VR would help the Homeless and what good it would do for babies
   481	 dying of AIDS in Africa.  This would be like asking Alexander Graham
   482	 Bell in 1870 what the telephone was going to do to stop the
   483	 Franco-Prussian War.
   484	
   485	      VR is now at the Wright Brothers stage, the thing's sputtering
   486	 and popping and just barely getting off the ground--and everyone's
   487	 trying to predict what moon-rockets will be like.  Back then, instead
   488	 of William Gibson, you had Jules Verne's sci-fi model; and in sixty
   489	 years we did walk on the moon.  But who could have imagined any of the
   490	 mundane and earth-changing reality in between-- 747s and People's
   491	 Express and plane-food and in-flight movies and jetlag?  Who, looking
   492	 at television in the 40s, could have predicted Watchman TV or
   493	 palm-size video cameras or the worldwide resonance of seeing Tiananmen
   494	 Square on CNN?  And the speed of the computer revolution is on an
   495	 altogether different scale.
   496	
   497	      If cars had progressed at the same rate, they'd cost $10 and run
   498	 for a lifetime on a tank of gas.  In ten years flat we've gone from
   499	 4000 to 4 million transistors on a thumbnail chip, and the power is
   500	 quadrupling every two years.  At this pace, science fiction like
   501	 Neuromancer becomes a myth of the present.  The technology has
   502	 progressed faster than our ability to even imagine what do to with it;
   503	 it's almost as though it has appeared magically and full-grown in our
   504	 midst.  The VR toys now being demonstrated barely scratch the surface
   505	 of the brain-extending fun and games possible when creative thinking
   506	 gets applied to this new and limitless computer power.  Hold tight:
   507	 the unimaginable future of virtual reality is only a few years away.
