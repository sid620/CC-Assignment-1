    26	Edit a 4dos.ini file if you don't have one.
    27	It should look something like this:
    28	
    29	Alias = 4096
    30	Environment = 1264
    31	History = 4096
    32	
    33	set alias and environment as low as possible, but remember to leave
    34	space for bat files and programs that use the space. A environment
    35	of 100 more that required is good. It is good to set the alias space
    36	as low as possible. Set the history as high as you prefer. I like 4k,
    37	others might like more...
    38	
    39	UMBLoad = Yes
    40	UMBEnvironment = Yes
    41	UMBHistory = Yes
    42	UMBAlias = Yes
    43	
    44	If you have umb's, specify these 4 lines!
    45	
    46	DescriptionMax=200
    47	
    48	ALWAYS insert this line! Now you can describe up to 200 characters, which
    49	is more than enough in most cases. The default of 40(?) is almost never
    50	enough...
    51	
    52	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    53	If you need file-descriptions that is MORE that 200 characters, remove
    54	the attributes on the DESCRIPT.ION file (attrib -h descript.ion)
    55	edit it, and turn the attributes back on (attrib +h descript.ion)
    56	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    57	
    58	>HistWinHeight=32
    59	
    60	If you drive your screen at text resolutions of 50 lines or more, have
    61	the luxury of a bigger history window! (PgUp, PgDn, etc.)
    62	
    63	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
    64	
    65	The prompt leaves you many fancy options other that $p$g.....
    66	Mine, help from 4dos and ansi.sys, shows time, date, free memory
    67	(conv, xms, ems), free hd space (all drives), in full colours...
    68	
    69	You can find it in the extras\prompt.set, which you will have to load
    70	with SET /R [name of file]. Modify it as you like, bacause it is free to
    71	spread!
    72	
    73	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
    74	
    75	With 4dos, you have the luxury of specifying to "md" or "cd" several
    76	directories at once. You can, for instance, md a b c d e f, in which
    77	will make the directories "a" "b", etc....
    78	
    79	You can even create a total tree with the "/s" parameter.
    80	This will allow you to create directories more than one level deep at once.
    81	
    82	fx: md c:\hi\I\am\here!
    83	
    84	will work, even if "c:\hi" does not exist in forehand!
    85	
    86	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
    87	
    88	In 4dos, the command-line separator is "^".
    89	That means that you can write several commands on one line, fx.
    90	
    91	cls^dir /w /s|list /s^pause^cls
    92	
    93	This method can in turn create neat aliases, and if you need examples,
    94	look at MY aliases file! (Included in EXTRAS\aliases.ali        !!!!
    95	
    96	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
    97	
    98	Be sure to remap your most used commands in dos to 1-key punches,
    99	to maximize performance. See my alias-file for guidance.
   100	Ex: "d" is "dir", etc....
