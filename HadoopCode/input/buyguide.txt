     7	Since initial response has been favorable, I'll probably continue to post

    22	PC Gaming Sound Cards - A Buyer's Guide v0.34 (11/4/94)
    23	
    24	This guide is directed at gamers in the market for a new PC soundcard.  Let
    25	me state up front that I am not a soundcard hardware expert, musician, or
    26	soundcard "hobbyist," which may become obvious by whatever gaffs I make.
    27	This means not only one might be advised to take my observations on sound
    28	quality with the requisite NaCl, but also that again one best consider my
    29	observations to be applicable to the parochial interest of gaming.
    30	
    31	I have owned the Soundblaster (SB), SB Pro (SBP), Roland LAPC-1 (LAPC),
    32	Reveal Sound FX 32 (Ensoniq chipset), Logitech Soundman Wave, and Gravis
    33	Ultrasound (GUS).  I've also heard the Turtle Beach Maui, and some Roland
    34	products.  And wasted far too much time reading the net, magazine reviews
    35	and product literature.  My apologies for any offense I may cause, and for
    36	errors and omissions, but I do mean this to be my own subjective review.
    37	As always, I'll gladly entertain any (relatively civil) feedback.
    38	
    39	First, what do game players need/want?
    40	My priorities are, in order:
    41	1) Games compatibility (DAC, FM, hardware mpu401/G-MIDI, all in DOS).
    42	2) Sound quality.
    43	For compatibility, one currently needs an SB compatible DAC, very
    44	preferably SBP, and better yet,  16-bit on top of that.  But the last is of
    45	secondary importance as very few games support 16-bit.  Don't be mislead by
    46	"SB-16" on the game box or configuration menu.  They nearly always use 8-
    47	bit sound.  This may change in the future, so you may weigh the need for 16-
    48	bit more heavily.  Next is SB FM compatibility, which was called the (OPL2)
    49	Adlib standard.  Now that this encompasses the stereo OPL3 based SBP v2, it
    50	may be called the SBP standard.  Most games support SB and SBP FM.
    51	Mediocre as it sounds, I still want it for old games, new games that still
    52	don't support G-MIDI (or GM) music, and for those that do so badly (Fleet
    53	Defender comes to mind, not giving engine sounds).  Next, there is the
    54	emergent G-MIDI standard for music, mostly used with "wavetable" (a
    55	misnomer I won't get into) synth cards.  I demand hardware mpu-401 based
    56	support as the majority of games look for this.  You may be able to get
    57	software based drivers to work in most games.  In my experience, not in
    58	all, or near all.  Remember my bias: DOS (not OS/2, not even Windows)
    59	compatibility first.  Last, from my experience with the GUS, I've grown to
    60	appreciate RAM capability.  While not as yet a gaming advantage, it is fun!
    61	According to Rich Heimlich, who tests soundcards for a living, gaming and
    62	soundcard companies are looking at standardizing RAM support.  With this in
    63	mind, here we go...
    64	
    65	The Basics:
    66	Creative Labs Sound Blaster (v 2.0)
    67	For about $40, you enter the glorious world of non-PC speaker sound.  8-bit
    68	mono digital playback, 22kHz sampling (=11kHz audible), FM mono synth.
    69	Plus it has a joystick game port.  No input for CD audio.  Works with
    70	everything.  Digitized sounds and music can be quite lifelike, if a little
    71	noisy.  But upon first hearing the FM, I likened it to a glorified kazoo.
    72	
    73	Sound Blaster Pro (v 2)
    74	For about $60 (OEM) to $80, get the above plus stereo digital and FM
    75	sounds, a CD-rom interface for Creative (Panasonic) drives, an internal
    76	connector for Red Book (audio) CD's, a line-in, and more IRQ and DMA
    77	choices for fewer conflicts.  Well worth the extra $$.  If you buy used,
    78	make sure it is SBP2, not SBP1.  The initial ones had two OPL2 chips
    79	instead of the more capable stereo OPL3 synth.  Aside from stereo, don't
    80	expect it to sound different from an SB in games.
    81	
    82	Sound Blaster SB-16 (many versions)
    83	The following are available: SB-16 Value Edition ($95), SB-16 Basic ($95),
    84	and versions with either SCSI-2 or multi-CD interface (the previous two
    85	have the Creative/Panasonic, the MCD adds Mitsumi and Sony), and
    86	with/without the Advanced Signal Processor (ASP) chip.  Prices range from
    87	about $130 to $200.  The choice depends on your CD needs.  Many report that
    88	these cards are fairly noisy.  As to the ASP, it is used for Q-sound
    89	(surround), real-time digital sound compression, and text-to-voice.  I'd
    90	call the ASP of little utility for gamers right now.  All have the OPL3,
    91	same as the SBP.  All claim to be SBP compatible, but net consensus is that
    92	it often is NOT (at least for DAC).  So often you may have to use it as an
    93	SB, not SBP.  All EXCEPT the Value Edition have the ASP socket and
    94	"Waveblaster" (WB) connector.  The WB connector has become the standard for
    95	G-MIDI daughter boards.  This is one of its most important gaming features.
    96	If it wasn't for that, I'd just say get the SBPro for better gaming
    97	compatibility.  Through the connector, it gives access to some fine, and
    98	inexpensive G-MIDI cards.  Plus 16-bit may see future support.  So it's a
    99	tough call between it and the SBP.  Just don't get the Value Edition!
   100	
   101	Mediavision (MV) 3D Premium
   102	About $145, but occasionally sighted at lower.  Comes with either the multi-
   103	CD or SCSI-2 interfaces.  A bit cheaper, and more feature laden than the
   104	equivalent SB-16's.  Has 16-bit record/playback,  OPL3 FM, "SBP
   105	compatibility," SRS surround sound, WB connector, and VESA compatible.  To
   106	date, the VESA spec hasn't caught on, so it may, or may not be an
   107	advantage.  This card is generally getting higher marks for quietness
   108	compared to the SB-16's.  While the card is relatively new, reports have
   109	been generally positive, most claiming near complete SBP compatibility.
   110	One negative it shares with the SB-16's is the lack of a non-amplified line-
   111	out.  Also some have reported two joystick problems: no port disable (some
   112	say it auto-disables if another joystick port is detected), and conflicts
   113	with joystick2 and the midi output (has been noted that other cards can
   114	have this problem and the workaround is an easy rewiring of the joystick-
   115	port connection).  Note: this card is NOT PAS-16 compatible, so even MV is
   116	abandoning their old line.  MV is also in financial straits.  I don't see
   117	this as a major issue if the SBP and G-MIDI (through the WB connector)
   118	compatibility is there.  It may impact future driver support.  So questions
   119	exist, but this board may be a player.
   120	
   121	MV Premium Deluxe
   122	Brand new.  At $99, essentially the above card without the SRS, some of the
   123	software, and a few other nonessentials.  You can always get the SRS later
   124	with the Nureality Vivid 3D box ($59).  It adds a joystick disable jumper.
   125	Perhaps only a multi-CD version?  A cheaper alternative to the SB16 MCD,
   126	and other MV/SB WB-compatible cards.
   127	
   128	MV Pro Audio Spectrum 16 (PAS-16)
   129	While cheap, and having a cleaner 16-bit digital stage than SB's, I can't
   130	recommend it as: (1) it only has SB compatibility, and (2) MV doesn't even
   131	support it in the new cards.  Expect game support to wane.  But if you were
   132	going to stop at the absolute minimum, an SB, consider a $50 PAS-16 Basic
   133	(no CD interface) instead.
   134	
   135	There are plenty of SB/SBP/16-bit compatible clones out there like the
   136	Aztech line.  Aztech has some with WB connectors too.  There was one older
   137	Aztech (Sound Galaxy NX Pro 16) that had the WB connector, but it wasn't
   138	functional in DOS.  Avoid that one. I know even less about these others, so
   139	I won't comment any more on them.  The Turtle Beach Tahiti, while by all
   140	reports a fine digitizing card plus WB connector, is not SB compatible.  It
   141	is a Windows product and has no use in almost any game.  I mention it for
   142	completeness.
   143	
   144	Wavetable Sound
   145	Most new games support G-MIDI for potentially far superior music.  It is
   146	usually used in tandem with digitized effects.  G-MIDI sound is best when
   147	played through a wavetable (WT) synth.  These games virtually all list
   148	support for one of: "waveblaster" (WB), "sound canvas" (SC), "GS" (same as
   149	SC),  General Midi (GM, G-MIDI), and sometimes more than one of these.
   150	This is a point of some confusion, as they often mean the same thing.  The
   151	WB is a GM card.  The Roland SC has the GS set which is a superset of GM,
   152	GS having many more instruments and drum kits.  Some now say that games
   153	that say SC or GS actually use more than the GM set, and only the Roland SC
   154	products take advantage.  This may very well be true and a reason to opt
   155	for those Rolands.  I don't know one way or the other.  In practice, I
   156	think you will be more than happy with the GM compatible cards.  There are
   157	other cards whose games compatibility is derived through drivers, most
   158	notably the SB AWE32 and the GUS.  For a gamer, I'd strongly recommend
   159	sticking with the better support of hardware GM cards.  Note that some
   160	games attempt to use the GM synth for some effects.  This may result in
   161	widely varying, and sometimes poor, results.
   162	
   163	I'll separate the products into those that require a slot (thus stand alone
   164	or with any other card), and those that require a WB connector host card
   165	(daughter boards).
   166	
   167	Slot Cards
   168	
   169	Gravis Ultrasound and Ultrasound Max
   170	Taking on this board invariably invites the wrath of its faithful.  So I'll
   171	explain.  $100 and $180 respectively.  The first features 16-bit playback,
   172	only 8-bit record (not a gaming issue), a 256K (1MB maximum) RAM sample
   173	based wavetable synth, and speed compensating game port.  You'll want to
   174	upgrade to the full 1MB (add $20).  Has 32-voice polyphony, but only at
   175	19KHz sampling.  Full 44KHz is limited to 14 voices (best is a compromise
   176	between).  The Max is the above plus 16-bit record, a multi-CD interface,
   177	and 512K RAM (but costs as much to fill to 1MB).  The SB DAC support is
   178	usually good through a software driver.  The FM emulation by the synth is
   179	poor, especially in effects.  So, at best, I'd say use it in tandem with an
   180	SB compatible card.  And its GM support is through software.  Some will say
   181	no problem.  My experience is otherwise, and not through lack of trying.  I
   182	found it worked acceptably in about 2/3 of my GM compatible games.  And in
   183	those, sometimes not as well as I would hope (partly due to the 1MB limit).
   184	It won't work in protected mode games that don't use standard drivers or
   185	have direct GUS support (ex: most Origin games).  Positives for the card
   186	include the price, fine included software, incredible user free/shareware
   187	and support, hardware mixing capabilities that make it *the* Mod soundcard,
   188	good digitized sound, good midi sound due to its 5+MB of samples hard disk
   189	loaded into the RAM, and RAM sampling allowing user-created sounds.  But if
   190	you value compatibility, look elsewhere.
   191	
   192	Turtle Beach Maui
   193	It's only a GM synth, so you'll need the SB/SBP for digitized sound and FM.
   194	Has 2MB of ROM samples (compressed from Rio's 4MB set),  256K of RAM
   195	standard (8MB max).  At $128, it is an affordable entry into WT sound.  I'd
   196	rate the midi quality on par with the GUS.  For me, easily good enough for
   197	games.  And like that card, you can upload, and have access, to new sounds
   198	into RAM if you so choose.  Like the GUS, access to the RAM is quick, about
   199	a MB in a few seconds.  Connect to an SBP via either card's out/in.  For
   200	SBP owners, it's the easiest, cheapest entry into WT GM gaming.  One
   201	negative is the rather long driver loading of about 25 seconds every cold
   202	boot.
   203	
   204	Ensoniq Soundscape, Reveal Soundwave 32 FX
   205	Available from Ensoniq and various OEMs.  About $180 (I saw the Reveal for
   206	$155 at Computer City).  Like the GUS, attempts to be an all-in-one, and
   207	fails.  Has 16-bit record/playback,  a 2MB ROM based synth,  multi-CD
   208	connector, SB (not Pro) "compatible."  The FM emulation through the synth
   209	is awful, and SB DAC compatibility is not perfect.  So I also would insist
   210	on having an SBP/16 in tandem.  I had no problem getting it to work in all
   211	my games this way with my SBPro.  I found it to be a quiet card, with good
   212	record/playback.  I rate the GM synth as somewhat better than those of the
   213	GUS and Maui, with "crisper" sounds.  Most professional reviews have been
   214	favorable too.  Tradeoff vs Maui (remember, I think the Ensoniq needs a
   215	defacto SBP): better sound, 16-bit for Windows and maybe future games,  but
   216	no RAM.
   217	
   218	Logitech Soundman Wave
   219	About $180.  Also an "all-in-one".  16-bit record/playback, a 2MB ROM based
   220	OPL4 synth, which includes WT and an OPL3, SB compatible, mostly SBP
   221	compatible, and SCSI interface.  An effects DB is planned.  I found that it
   222	worked perfectly for SB DAC and FM, but not for SBP stereo DAC games.  The
   223	latter gave sound out of the left channel only.  The card was very noisy
   224	having a high pitch squeal in 44kHz and stereo modes, and background noise.
   225	Many reviews have noted this, others have noted very good S/N!  Perhaps now
   226	fixed, or computer dependent?  The WT sound isn't as good as the other
   227	cards mentioned above, with strings and winds especially weak.  While some
   228	magazines have panned it, others inexplicably praised the sound.  It is
   229	still far superior to FM, and I'd call it good enough for all but the more
   230	discriminating gamers.  But with the emerging crop of cards, I consign it
   231	to also-ran status.
   232	
   233	Mediatrix Audiotrix Pro
   234	An OPL4 card like the Logitech.  I recall it uses the same sample set
   235	(though one respondee claims otherwise), it so should have the same
   236	middling midi quality.  If it doesn't have the noise problems, it may be
   237	worth considering.  It offers both effects and RAM daughter boards.  Was
   238	introductory priced at $200.  Hopefully its price is continuing downward as
   239	competition has strengthened.  As they may perhaps be only available
   240	direct, I include their phone number: (800)-820-8749.
   241	
   242	Turtle Beach Monte Carlo
   243	Only $99, but there's a reason.  The card has 16-bit record/playback and an
   244	OPL3. Claims "101%" games compatibility, but the only user report I've seen
   245	mentioned problems with the SBPro sound.  As important, the WT is software
   246	based and, according to the box, only works in Windows.  It also requires a
   247	fast processor.  So not a gaming wavetable solution.
   248	
   249	Turtle Beach Tropez
   250	As of this update, the Tropez still has just been released, and reports are
   251	barely trickling in.  So still take care with the assumptions.  At $200,
   252	this may be a most viable all-in-one solution.  16-bit record/playback
   253	(based on the Monte Carlo), 2MB ROM based synth, RAM capability (max 12MB),
   254	enhanced IDE interface.  From the specs, I guess TB quality digitized sound
   255	(excellent, but not "Hurricane" based), the same synth as the Maui (again
   256	hardware compatible), and the Maui's fast access to RAM.  Rich Heimlich,
   257	who tested a pre-production model, says the card *is* SBP compatible. IF
   258	all the above holds true, maybe the cheapest, and certainly a good entry
   259	into full games capability.
   260	
   261	SB AWE32
   262	$265.  An SB-16 MCD plus built in 1MB ROM E-Mu based synth, 0.5MB RAM (32MB
   263	expandable!), and chorus/reverb on FM and WT.  The synth is only software
   264	mpu401/GM compatible, like the GUS.  So it won't work in non-standard
   265	driver protected mode games, unless they include native AWE support
   266	(patches are out for many games).  And the drivers take up a lot of
   267	precious low memory (at least 44K).  So consider adding QEMM if you want
   268	this card.  It has the WB connector so you can add a hardware compatible GM
   269	card to circumvent these problems.  Reports on sound quality run the gamut.
   270	I most trust those with a musical bent, including Keyboard Mag, which
   271	haven't been complimentary.  Its chorus, reverb, Q-sound and RAM sample
   272	upload capability make it versatile and better sounding.  Further, the RAM
   273	and E-MU's "Sound Font" technology have potential gaming advantages, if
   274	they are ever supported (see opening notes).  This seems nothing less than
   275	an attempt by CL to set and control another standard.  Judging by the early
   276	strong support (Doom, Tie Fighter, many new titles), they may very well
   277	succeed.  But because of the lack of the current standard support, I'd
   278	recommend either getting one of the other hardware compatible GM synths,
   279	spending a small fortune on the AWE32 plus a daughter board, or waiting it
   280	out.
   281	
   282	SB AWE32 Value Edition
   283	This is a bare bones version aimed at the gamer.  It is the same as above
   284	but deletes the ASP, WB connector, and SIMM slots for optional RAM (still
   285	has the default 512K).  Without the ASP, you lose Q-sound on WAV and FM.
   286	If the AWE32 takes over as the standard, it offers a marginally ($40??)
   287	cheaper way to get most of the gaming functionality.  But for now, it
   288	offers less as it doesn't have the option of adding a hardware compatible
   289	GM synth.
   290	
   291	MediaVision 3D Pro.
   292	$260, with some Computer City's (800-843-2489) offering it for as low as
   293	$200 (probably gone before you read this).  Not a single card, but a
   294	combination of the MV 3D Premium and the Korg DB, at a potentially great
   295	price.  See those two for features, questions, and caveats.  If it meets
   296	its claims, a top choice.   Compared to the Tropez, it adds reverb/chorus,
   297	SRS, a bigger, and probably better ROM synth set, SCSI-2 (vs enhanced IDE),
   298	but no RAM capability.  For gaming, I'd call that a win for the MV, though
   299	I like RAM.  At the normal price, perhaps a slight nod over the SB-16+DB
   300	combos.
   301	
   302	Roland SCC-1
   303	$275.  The original GM/GS card, it has the same instrument set as the SC-55
   304	module.  4MB ROM sample set, reverb/chorus.  Like the Maui, it requires a
   305	tandem SB type card for gaming support.  With this one, you get exactly
   306	what the game music designers intended as this is the card they virtually
   307	all use.  Roland sound quality carries a big reputation too.  Reverb/chorus
   308	reportedly makes the already top notch sample set even better.  I found
   309	their effects to be subtle, though most GM aficionados insist on them.
   310	Quite possible I used a simpler rendering than these cards provide.  SBPro
   311	+ this gives perfect games compatibility, only lacking 16-bit.  Look for
   312	the SCC-1B , which includes more bundled software, and adds the extra
   313	sounds of the SC-55mkII.
   314	
   315	Roland RAP-10
   316	$250.  This is a combination of the SC-7 module (GM not GS, 4MB ROM,
   317	reverb/chorus) and a 16-bit digitized stage on a card.  The DAC is not SB-
   318	compatible, so again, an SB type card is needed.  The midi gets the usual
   319	glowing Roland reviews, the ADC/DAC is reviewed less favorably.  Part of
   320	this is explained by its passing through the effects engine of the card.
   321	The advantage over an SCC-1 is having the 16-bit support in Windows.  The
   322	disadvantage is not having the full GS set.
   323	
   324	Aria & Analog Devices DSP
   325	There are many wavetable cards based on the Analog Devices DSP (ex: Orchid
   326	Soundwave/Gamewave), and Sierra Aria (Prometheus Aria 16se).  Their
   327	wavetable sound have been universally panned,  with some Orchid reviewers
   328	claiming they thought they were listening to FM.  Some of these cards offer
   329	16-bit record/playback and other features for around $100.  Maybe not a bad
   330	deal if you want something with SB compatibility, 16-bit, and somewhat
   331	better than FM sound (when supported).  The SB FM sound is usually
   332	considered to be good.  While the Aria's are not hardware GM compatible, I
   333	understand a TSR is available to make any Aria soundcard GM compatible in
   334	many games.  But don't expect sound comparable to any of the other WT cards
   335	in this guide.  I never considered them serious wavetable contenders and
   336	thus never learned much about them.
   337	
   338	Daughter boards
   339	All these require a WB compatible connector.  They are all hardware mpu401
   340	compatible GM synths.  So they should work fine in games.  They generally
   341	offer a cheaper upgrade route.  Most have reverb and chorus effects which
   342	give more full and natural sounds.  The only one with RAM is the Rio (but
   343	see caveat).  With some, you are getting chipsets and many of the samples
   344	found in the companies' multi-K$ synths.
   345	
   346	Turtle Beach Rio
   347	$130.  4MB ROM set.  Expect it to sound somewhat better than the Maui's as
   348	it isn't compressed.  Has reverb presets, but no chorus.  A negative is
   349	that the additional 4MB RAM capability is crippled by slow access times
   350	through the WB connector (10+ minutes per MB).  Again, the latter isn't a
   351	real gaming issue.  So a good, cheap, gaming choice.
   352	
   353	MediaVision Korg
   354	$145.  4MB ROM set, reverb/chorus.  Most reports, including from
   355	professionals, say excellent, one mentioned plusses and minuses compared to
   356	the GUS, and one said crappy.  I'd expect it to be a fine performer based
   357	on Korg's reputation and sample size.
   358	
   359	CL Waveblaster
   360	$170.  4MB ROM set, older E-Mu synth (no reverb/chorus).  Again opinions
   361	vary, generally reviewed below most other daughterboards, but probably fine
   362	for games.  The first WB daughterboard, it surprisingly hasn't dropped in
   363	price.  It gets little attention from CL, and may be discontinued.  I'd opt
   364	for one of the other newer cards.
   365	
   366	Roland SCD-10
   367	$160.  Roland SC-7 on a daughterboard.  Similar to a RAP-10 without the
   368	digital channels.  GM set (4MB?), reverb/chorus, not the full GS set.  A
   369	fine choice.  See comments on the RAP-10.
   370	
   371	Roland SCD-15
   372	$210.  Roland SC-55mkII (Sound Canvas) on a daughterboard.  Similar to the
   373	SCC-1B (perhaps more voices), except not requiring a slot.  Similar to the
   374	SCD-10, plus the full GS (354 instruments, 9 drum sets).  Now you know you
   375	are getting exactly what it was meant to sound like.  So for the best, this
   376	is it.  Again, the only downside (and presently not a gaming issue) is the
   377	lack of RAM.
   378	
   379	Wearnes/AVM Summit (Kurzweil-based)
   380	Wearnes makes a daughterboard, AVM Summit is an external box.  Kurzweil is
   381	another big name in synths and this one comes loaded with 6MB of samples.
   382	Reviewers have been impressed with the sound.  One owner said some of the
   383	samples are Kurzweil's best, but some GM samples are "faked."  The price of
   384	around $350 is higher than any of the above.
   385	
   386	Aztech Wavepower
   387	Uses the Ensoniq synth and 2MB samples, but reportedly only 8-bit.  I
   388	believe it sells for around $120.  Reviews have been negative, so I
   389	recommend looking at other cards.
   390	
   391	Ensoniq may have other versions available as daughterboards.  If they use
   392	the full 16-bit samples, they should sound like the Reveal card I tried.
   393	This  may make it a contender against the cheaper cards.  Also, they plan
   394	to release a RAM capable card in '95.
   395	
   396	Some comments about a dying standard: Roland MT-32/LAPC-1.  I still have an
   397	LAPC-1.  Using an older synth technology, it doesn't sound nearly as
   398	realistic as the good WT cards.  But it is far better than FM.  This line
   399	is discontinued, so game support is slowly waning.  Yet I still find the
   400	occasional new title that supports it, and not GM.  Where it shines is in
   401	non-digitized effects that are far superior to FM or GM.  So even in some
   402	GM games, I'd opt to use it.  Many GM cards claim MT-32 compatibility.  But
   403	in practice, this is for the music, not the effects.  The latter are
   404	handled by "system exclusive" (sysex) messages these other cards (including
   405	Roland's own SC series) can't process.  End result, poor or no effects, and
   406	possible hangs.  Bottom line is, if you want true MT-32 compatibility, you
   407	need an MT-32, CM-32L, CM-64 (all external modules needing an mpu-401
   408	interface card) or an LAPC-1.
   409	
   410	I hope I've touched on the main players and gaming issues.  Other things
   411	you may want to consider are included OS drivers, optional IRQ's and
   412	addresses, jumperless installation, included software, support, and more.
   413	
   414	In summary, we finally may have acceptable all-in-one WT gaming cards
   415	appearing, though combos still give the best functionality and sound  And
   416	the prices have been dropping.  For those starting out, or willing to sell
   417	their current hardware, I suggest paying attention to reports on the new
   418	Tropez and MV 3D Pro.  Or consider the MV 3D Premium (or deluxe)+ other
   419	daughterboard.  If you already have an SBPro, I recommend the Maui for
   420	economy, the SCC-1 for the best.  Or split the difference with the Ensoniq,
   421	which sounds better than the first, has 16-bit, but no RAM.  If you have an
   422	SB-16, save money with one of the daughter boards.  The prices of the Rio,
   423	Korg, and SCD-10 are close enough such that you should pick the one which
   424	sounds best to you, with perhaps the nod to the Roland for games fidelity.
   425	You might want to spend the extra $50 and get the full GS compatible SCD-15
   426	to know you have everything the game designers intended.
   427	
   428	The prices listed here are mail order estimates as of mid October '94.
   429	Many are from Computability (800-554-9978).  Also check out CDW, which
   430	allows returns (800-537-6752).  Two game-oriented mail order companies that
   431	carry soundcards are Chips&Bits (800-699-GAME) and Computer Express (800-
   432	228-7449).
