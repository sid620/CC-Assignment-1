     4	This version *supersedes* previous "editions"; they may safely be deleted
     5	without loss of important information.
     6	As always, this is coming out in a rush, so there are probably lots of holes,
     7	etc. Also, this is a rather long document, and unless you have some sort of
     8	keyword search you may have trouble finding what you're after. I am hoping to
     9	get a hypertext version of this woven into the WorldWideWeb some day [telnet
    10	info.cern.ch and look around] but dont hold your breath. In the mean time
    11	just delete what you dont want. IF YOU ARE GOING TO ARCHIVE THIS OR REPRODUCE
    12	IT, FEEL FREE TO EDIT IT FOR COMPREHENSIBILITY, RELEVANCE, ETC.
    13	
    14	At the last minute, trying to put something together for release, I have
    15	simply joined together some "unprocessed" files - they describe:
    16	i] some things from the slopoke ftp site
    17	ii] contents of the red.css political archive [ftp]
    18	iii] scott yanoff's internet resource list
    19	iv] an IRC FAQ
    20	v] some stuff 'left over' from the future-culture FAQ
    21	vi] cult of the dead cow newfiles
    22	vii] ftp.rahul.net archive contents
    23	viii] email addresses for sf fan groups
    24	In the interests of getting info out, etc, this hodgepodge is going out in a
    25	separate file - if anyone wants to archive it as well, & you're on a dos
    26	system, I suggest weird2-1.doc and weird2-1.sup as file names.
    27	
    28	if you see something in the unseen category & want to write a review, send it
    29	to me, say whether you want your name used, etc.
    30	
    31	A  general note: the "best" general net guides are in my opinion
    32	the FutureCulture FAQ (see cyberpunk section) & the Scott Yanoff guide
    33	(appended to this document).
    34	For hardcopy, try the books by Krol and LaQuey, and watch out for Howard
    35	Rheingold's new book on the Internet...

   228		    *complete* texts of the Book of Lies, Book of the Law, Book 4,
   229		    Magick in Theory and Practice, Magick Without Tears, and some
   230		    (or all) copies of the Equinox. (Crowley's magickal journal/
   231		    zine/publication type thing) All this stuff is in directory

   235	Also worth perusing are wilson.on.cis, an online conference with RAWilson as
   236	guest participant, and cybercraft, which contains an exposition of Leary's
   237	8-circuit model. ALSO, copies of the Equinox are retailing where I live
   238	for about $700 (for 10 vols.) at present. You could probably make yourself
   239	same money, and do yourself a favor, and violate some sort of copyright law
   240	by printing copies of the Equinox based on the slopoke material.
   241	  In fact the whole slopoke site is just one of the best. They have an old
   242	alt.slack archive (old*slack!), extensive Notes on Kabbala that you won't

   381	I'd strongly suggest just getting the CD-ROMs instead of attempting
   382	to transfer scores of gigabytes of pix and other material.
   383	To access the online catalog of NASA material, CD-ROMS, et cetera:
   384		telnet nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov
   385		login as "NODIS"
   386		no password

   388	Anonymous ftp sites (five):
   389	nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov [128.183.10.4]
   390		This is a VAX/VMS box, so you must ftp-login as "anonymous".  To get
   391		a dir listing into a file on your system:
   392		ftp> dir [...] file_on_your_system
   393	vab02.larc.nasa.gov
   394	     lots of stuff, including Aliens of all colors, and UFO pix (though this
   395		seems to mirror a lot of what's at phoenix.oulu.fi and has some
   396		additional material).
   397	ames.arc.nasa.gov
   398		online copies of what appears to be all NASA's CD-ROMs, and lots of
   399		GIFs, *.img and *.jpg from most (all?) space missions since Apollo.
   400	iris1.ucis.dal.ca

   423	a process used by Discordians, Erisians and Anarchists against
   424	governments, corporations and in general, The Establishment.
   425	This process involves sending many letters from different
   426	parts of the country/world and is called Operation Mindfuck.
   427	With the advent of e-mail, Operation Mindfucks are much more
   428	easily coordinated.  One such network can be joined by e-mailing
   429	corleyj@gas.uug.arizona.edu.  Networks are set up around
   430	communal responsibility.  Everyone agrees to participate in
   431	everyone else's Mindfuck.  If A helps B Fuck the IRS, then when

   926	           suggesting that AI as goal-directed behavior is non-reversible

  1066	- after the last Hwbemail was posted to Usenet the full Amixinfo blurb was
  1067	posted, here are some excerpts:
  1068	AMIX, the American Information Exchange, is something completely new --
  1069	an online Information Marketplace (R).  On AMIX, anyone can both buy and
  1070	_sell_ documents, software, or anything that can be stored digitally.
  1071	Those who buy or sell customized information can carry out consulting
  1072	contracts, even very small ones, easily and profitably.  AMIX handles all
  1073	the funds transfer automatically.
  1074	This Information Marketplace has been open for business continuously since
  1075	January 1, 1992.  Consulting contracts are being made and fulfilled; 
  1076	document sales are occurring on a daily basis in key markets; and information
  1077	providers continue to "stock the shelves" with new goods in all markets.  
  1078	The AMIX software allows customers to explore the system online with guest 
  1079	access, and to register their own account online to receive full access.
  1080	Customers who open their accounts now will have their monthly fees waived
  1081	for the month in which they sign up and for the following month.
  1082	To receive the AMIX software disk, enabling guest exploration of the system
  1083	and self-registration, contact AMIX by email at amixinfo@markets.amix.com
  1084	or by phone (415) 903-1015.
  1085	What follows is an overview of AMIX: its concepts, structure, and function; 
  1086	the market-building phase; and advantages of early entry into the market.
  1087	[but i wont include this..]
  1088	AMIX, AMIX Service, Information Marketplace, and Information Markets are 
  1089	trademarks of the American Information Exchange Corporation. All other 
  1090	product, brand, or company names are trademarks of their respective holders.

  1213	A lot of people have talked about email hacks here, and some have mentioned
  1214	not being terribly familiar yet with Internet.  Here's a couple good
  1215	pointers:
  1216	 
  1217	starters:
  1218	_The Internet Companion_ by Tracy LaQuey, with Jeanne Ryer, forward by Al
  1219	Gore.
  1220	"A Beginner's Guide To Global Networking".  Hey, it's only eleven bucks,
  1221	it's extremely readable, and even the direst Net guru can learn a few tricks
  1222	here.  Tracy knows the Net, in vivid detail, and explains its workings at
  1223	the level of somebody who knows enough to power up their Mac or PC.  ISBN
  1224	0-201-62224-6, Addison-Wesley, 1993.  I'll post a better review to the Net
  1225	later..  Send email to: "internet-companion@utexas.edu" for info, ordering,
  1226	etc.
  1227	
  1228	not-so-novice:
  1229	There's an email list called Cypherpunks outta Berkeley.  If U know what
  1230	you're doing here, you might wanna get on it..  Lots of encryption
  1231	discussion, but also the place where these anonymous remailers have been
  1232	breeding.  Guaranteed that you'll learn more than you ever thought possible
  1233	about email hacks, if you can grok that list's discussions.  Send email to:

  1453	Watch out for Interzine!! The irregularly produced zine devoted to "interviews
  1454	in cyberspace". The first and so far only issue is a chat with Jagwire X,
  1455	founder of the AUtopia list on the idea of an ocean-going New Edge colony
  1456	[autopia-request@wixer.cactus.org - or maybe bigtex.cactus.org now], and it's
  1457	archived somewhere at red.css.itd.umich.edu. Watch out for Rez in Issue #2!

  1463	Some last-minute additions: pdm@ucrmath.ucr.edu maintains an
  1464	"Electronic/Industrial/Etc zines list" (note, those are snail-mail zies)
  1465	which has just been posted to alt.zines, alt.industrial and
  1466	rec.music.industrial; and spingo@panix.com wants you to send him your

  1475	arts..." who have put out over 40 collections of such - now taproot is
  1476	experimentally going online with a collection of zine reviews. i have seen
  1477	issue #0, part 1, which contains those reviews; i am not a zine person
  1478	myself (i have my hands full with what i'm getting over the net!!) but
  1479	some of the stuff reviewed looked really interesting. there's also reviews
  1480	of poetry chapbooks (?) (unseen) and future issues will include mailart
  1481	sections. [speaking of which, is there such a thing as internet mailart
  1482	yet?] send a request and luigi-bob will mail you with whatever he has.
  1483	worth getting. and say you liked it if you did (same applies to all these
  1484	people); feedback is essential at this stage of development.

  1641	   methods of altering consciousness. A strong emphasis is placed

  1682	Announcement: New Electronic Magazine 'Psyche'.
  1683	[first issue out march '93?] 
  1684	Examples of some of the general areas that Psyche will cover
  1685	are: the mind-body problem; altered-states-of-consciousness;
  1686	psychoactive drugs; shamanism; dream states; hypnosis;
  1687	artificial intelligence; meditative states; ecstatic
  1688	religious states; blindsight; language and mind.
  1689	In an attempt to offer a grounding in some of the central
  1690	themes of Psyche, major review articles of influential
  1691	ideas/books/movements will also be solicited. Examples of
  1692	what these might be are: John Searle's Chinese Room Problem;
  1693	Daniel Dennett's book 'Consciousness Explained'; Gordon
  1694	Wasson's theories regarding Soma; Roger Penrose's book 'The
  1695	Emperor's New Mind'.
  1696	While Psyche will not be peer-reviewed this does not mean
  1697	that it will become a haven for New Age/Lunatic Fringe ideas.
  1698	I have just completed a BSc Honours majoring in psychology,
  1699	and I am currently studying the way the brain codes the
  1700	position of objects. I would like to balance by skills with
  1701	others and so am particularly interested in getting in
  1702	contact with people with backgrounds in either computer
  1703	science, philosophy or anthropology to act as sub/co-editors.
