     1	                                INTRODUCTION
     2	
     3	Hello, folks!
     4	
     5	This text file is an attempt to answer the commonly asked questions I
     6	constantly see on IBMHW. The questions are very simple, but the task
     7	of responding to them is difficult, takes quite a while to compose and
     8	can really only touch the highlights of SCSI. I felt that a file
     9	posted in the library would serve to give people a start to understand
    10	SCSI and some of the important parts that relate to day-to-day
    11	installations and usage.
    12	
    13	This is not a detailed explanation, as the SCSI specifications
    14	contain the details and are very extensive, besides an average user
    15	need not understand the technical aspects of SCSI to be able to
    16	install and use SCSI devices. I recommend that you scan this text and
    17	then home in on the part that you have a particular interest in for
    18	some details. Don't be daunted by all the information here, you don't
    19	have to understand it all to use SCSI. Most installations of SCSI
    20	devices are virtually plug and play with the newer host adapters and
    21	software packages. SCSI has indeed come a long way since the beginning
    22	and is rapidly becoming the technology of choice for
    23	performance-oriented systems and software.
    24	
    25	If you're a novice to SCSI or PCs, give chapter 4 "SCSI and the real
    26	life" a try - hopefully it has your answers to install a host adapter.
    27	
    28	There will be a companion file to this one which will give you the
    29	easy way to install SCSI devices. While it will revolve mostly around
    30	Adaptec products, it is in no way an attempt to sell Adaptec products
    31	and no Adaptec employee had any involvement in it's creation. (It's
    32	just that Skip - who wrote this introduction - and i have experience
    33	mostly with Adaptec's host adapters -Gerhard) Adaptec is the world's
    34	leader in SCSI hardware and SCSI software, and their products are more
    35	widely used and better known than other brands. There are also quite a
    36	few CIS members who are Adaptec gurus, due to experience with
    37	Adaptec's products on various forums, so you usually can get
    38	assistance wherever you are.
    39	
    40	But do remember that, for the most part, SCSI is SCSI and what applies
    41	to one supplier usually applies to them all.
    42	
    43	This text is based on my own knowledge of SCSI. and I'm not in any way
    44	omniscient, infallible or whatever <g>, I would like to get all sorts
    45	of comments about what may be wrong, what's missing and so on...
    46	
    47	Please take the SCSI-3 parts not too serious at the moment - I think I
    48	didn't make real errors, but - unlike SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 - the SCSI-3
    49	spec consists of various parts that are interlocked to each other and
    50	are still "subject to change". I'll keep an eye on it and update this
    51	over time. The SCSI-3 details will follow later, as I'll need some
    52	time to read through these docs and - especially - understand them.
    53	
    54	If you are interested in the official SCSI documents, NCR's SCSI BBS
    55	on ++1 - 719-574-0424 has them all. However, they are big and - in
    56	their naming scheme - somewhat hard to find.

    67	History:
    68	Rel. 0.8        Initial release on CIS.
    69	Rel. 0.9        Entered drivers for DOS and OS/2.
    70	                Moved the connectors to App. A.
    71	Rel. 0.91       68pin and 110pin connectors/ Disconnect / SCSI-ATAPI /
    72	                Dal Allen's article / added SDMS description / BBS #
    73	Rel. 0.92       Bertil Hagnell requested some information about SCSI
    74	                utilities, so i added some as chapter 5. Definitely not
    75	                complete, but where should i end this ?
    76	Rel. 0.93       finally dug out my old LADDR docs and added a slightly
    77	                more thorough definition.. Added Appendix D with some
    78	                QIC tape definitions. It's not directly relevant to
    79	                SCSI, but i got a few questions for the QIC/SCSI
    80	                relationship lately, so why not...
    81	        At this point, Skip Lutz rewrote parts of the text for a more
    82	        readable english and some news.
    83	Rel. 0.94       Minor changes contributed by Skip Lutz.
    84	                No content changes
    85	                Rewrote introduction
    86	Rel. 0.95       Couldn't stop working <g> Todd Plummer made me think
    87	                about RAID, so i included a simplified definition with
    88	                some generic SCSI device parts (chapter 6)... Also,
    89	                Mike B. pointed me towards a _big_ fault in the serial
    90	                SCSI-3 part...MBytes/sec instead of MBits/sec <sigh>

    94	-       PnP, SCAM and some ongoing protocols
    95	-       whatever you may find missing ...

   207	
   208	1.      What is SCSI ?
   209	
   210	        SCSI ( Small Computer System Interface ) is a general-purpose
   211	        parallel bus system. It originated from Shugart's 1979' SASI
   212	        (Shugart Associates System Interface) and Shugart and NCR
   213	        presented it to the ANSI in 1981.It beacme official in 1986,
   214	        when the ANSI-committee X3T9.2 defined the SCSI-1 spec as
   215	        document X3.131-1986.
   216	
   217	        Of course, "general-purpose parallel bus system" means all and
   218	        nothing. What helped SCSI to spread was its very high speed
   219	        (for this time) and - driver problems aside - its flexibility.
   220	        However, it was - and is - the disk and tape interface of choice
   221	        for Unix systems and that's where I first had contact with SCSI
   222	        - I changed from an MFM system with 2 * 80 MB disks and a QIC-02
   223	        tape controller (8 bit) to a SCSI system with a 380 MB disk and
   224	        a SCSI tape, both attached to one 16 Bit SCSI adapter - freed a
   225	        slot, one interrupt and was a _lot_ faster.
   226	
   227	        SCSI in all it's flavours is now an acknowledged and very well
   228	        standardized multipurpose interface. SCSI supports a wide
   229	        variety of devices which include hard disks, removeable disks,
   230	        magneto-optical devices, tape drives, printers, processors,
   231	        WORMs, CD-ROMs, scanners, medium-changers (jukeboxes), and
   232	        communication devices.
   233	
   234	        With PCs, the most common devices are hard disks, removeable
   235	        devices like MO, WORM, Syquest and Bernoulli disks, CDROMs,
   236	        tape drives and image scanners.
   237	
   238	        In the Macintosh world, where SCSI was included in all models
   239	        since the Mac Plus and expansion slots were not available on
   240	        some, there are even some SCSI-based video and network
   241	        adapters.
   242	
   243	
   244	1.1.    SCSI-1
   245	
   246	        SCSI-1 defined a universal 8 bit I/O-Bus that allows connection
   247	        of up to 8 devices including the so-called "host adapter". Every
   248	        device must have a unique ID in the range of 0 to 7. SCSI-1
   249	        was a high-speed bus system, compared to this time's
   250	        peripheral devices.
   251	
   252	
   253	1.2.    SCSI-2
   254	
   255	        SCSI-1 was the first approved standard and lacked some points
   256	        and some definitions. So SCSI-2 development and approval started
   257	        while SCSI-1 still wasn't officially approved. In 1986, when
   258	        SCSI-1 was officially approved, SCSI-2 already was in the works
   259	        until now, when on January 31, 1994, the draft in revision 10L
   260	        was approved by the ANSI Board of Standards Review.
   261	        The official SCSI-2 designation (doc. nr.) will be X3.131-1994.
   262	        As you might remember, most manufacturers used the term "SCSI-2"
   263	        from about 1988 in marketing. This isn't real approved SCSI-2,
   264	        of course, but mostly you can trust this, as the changes were
   265	        not big for "standard" devices. SCSI-2 merely entered a better
   266	        formal definition, removed some oddities and obsolete things,
   267	        added some extensions, and most importantly, added the ability
   268	        to double and even quadruple data transfer speed on the SCSI bus
   269	        with it's "Fast" SCSI and "Wide" SCSI options. Note the key word
   270	        - OPTIONS.
   271	
   272	        - The Type-1 connector (DB-50) was removed, high density SCSI-2
   273	          connector alternatives were added to the official options
   274	        - Synchronous Transfers became a standard feature, with optional
   275	        - Fast Synchronous Transfer Mode (Fast SCSI-2)
   276	        - Sync. Negotiation can be invoked by Initiator _and_ Target.
   277	        - 16Bit- and 32Bit-Wide SCSI became a defined option.
   278	        - SCSI bus parity changed from "optional" to "mandatory"
   279	        - Initiators now must provide terminator power
   280	        - Message support became mandatory
   281	        - Command Queueing became a defined option. For a device with
   282	          command queueing needs memory to reorder the commands,
   283	          this - with a little step further - introduced device caches,
   284	          that can be manipulated through the Mode Sense Pages.
   285	        - the Common Command Sets (CCS) for several device classes
   286	          became formally defined.
   287	
   288	        The only real possible problem I found with SCSI-2 compatibility
   289	        is, a lot of older host adapters - typically the SCSI initiator
   290	        - can't handle the SCSI-2 Sync. Negotiation when it's started by
   291	        the target. Both the host adapter and device can be easily
   292	        changed to prevent any problem here, and it's rare to begin
   293	        with.
   294	
   295	
   296	1.2.1.  Fast SCSI
   297	
   298	        With SCSI-2, Fast SCSI was defined as an option. Despite the
   299	        tendency of the market to define Fast-SCSI as "different, but
   300	        faster SCSI", Fast SCSI is only an additional synchronous data
   301	        transfer mode with tighter timing to achieve the 10MB/sec max.
   302	        data rate. As with any other synchronous transfer mode, only
   303	        data transfers are synchronous, the commands are transferred
   304	        asynchronous. Fast SCSI is _very_ picky with the SCSI cabling,
   305	        especially with round external cabling. Most external cables
   306	        doesn't support reliable Fast SCSI, the few that do are _very_
   307	        expensive. Fast SCSI is "not recommended" with passive
   308	        terminators. However, if you keep an eye on cable quality, I
   309	        found it working reliable on my system and most others I know.
   310	
   311	
   312	1.2.2.  Wide SCSI
   313	
   314	        Another SCSI-2 option is Wide SCSI. Two flavors are defined, 16
   315	        Bit and 32 Bit. Wide SCSI can be combined with Fast SCSI and so
   316	        can give up to 40 MB/sec data rate.
   317	        Every 8 bits have their own parity bit and also with every 8 bits
   318	        you have the possibility to address another 8 devices. For every
   319	        data bit line selects a device, with 16 Bit Wide SCSI, you can
   320	        address 16 devices, 32 Bit Wide SCSI has 32 possible ID's.
   321	        The X3T9.2 committee defined a 68-pin SCSI cable for 16Bit and
   322	        a combination of a standard 8Bit 'A' and a 68 pin 'B' cable for
   323	        16 Bit and 32 Bit Wide SCSI. However, there is a 110 pin
   324	        'L'-cable at least in discussion that will support 8, 16 and
   325	        32 Bit connections and should be standardized with SCSI-3.
   326	
   327	
   328	1.3.    SCSI-3
   329	
   330	        SCSI-3 is somewhat a revolution in the SCSI world - it defines
   331	        high speed _serial_ interfaces. At the moment, there seem to be
   332	        three of these serial interfaces in the works: Fiber Channel,
   333	        Fiber Channel Low cost and P1394.
   334	        On the software side, there seem to be only some small additions
   335	        for the command sets - a new command set for graphical devices,
   336	        a slight extension to the cache option and so on ... But still,
   337	        this may change ...
   338	
   339	        Many device suppliers are currently advertising their products
   340	        as SCSI-3 and this appears to be an attempt to make the consumer
   341	        think he is getting something "better" than SCSI-1 or -2.
   342	        All SCSI devices that support the Common Command Set can be run
   343	        with SCSI-1, -2, -3, and probably SCSI-4 some day. If you see
   344	        this being advertised, ask the suppier exactly how the device
   345	        is different with SCSI-3 implemented and/or supported. You'll
   346	        hear lots of Weasel Words, but no facts. The device just has
   347	        CCS support. Nothing to get excited about, and surely nothing
   348	        to pay extra for!
   349	
   350	        The Fiber channel and FC/LC should provide up to 100 MBits/sec
   351	        data throughput, where P1394, also called "FireWire", is defined
   352	        to give up to 200 MBits/sec. P1394 seems to have one advantage
   353	        over Fiber Channel - it's an "isochronous" transport layer, that
   354	        means, it delivers - and should guarantee - a continuous data
   355	        stream. This seems to be what the multimedia people pray for
   356	        - no missing parts in images and sounds.
   357	
   358	        There is also a new connector scheme called Single Connector
   359	        Attachment (SCA). SCA uses an 80-pin connector to provide all
   360	        neccessary signals for 8- and 16-bit SCSI devices, including
   361	        power connections, LED-control and so on. It's major advantage
   362	        is the possibility to use SCSI devices as a single plug-in
   363	        module without the need for an additional connector between
   364	        the bus and the device, as it's with today's cheap HD "drawers".
   365	        Although SCA devices should be on the market, I didn't see an
   366	        SCA device 'til now, so I think they'll take some time to show
   367	        up in PCs.
   368	
   369	        Also new in this game are SCAM, a SCSI auto-configuration
   370	        protocol, and Plug-and-Play-SCSI, the SCSI part of Plug-and-Play.
   371	        I'll dig inside this and then will add some chapters about...
   372	
   373	2.      Inside the Basics
   374	
   375	2.1.    ID's and LUNs
   376	
   377	        Every SCSI device need to have a unique ID on the bus. For this
   378	        reason, most devices have three ID jumpers to set the SCSI ID
   379	        from 0 to 7. In most cases, ID 7 is reserved for the host adapter.
   380	        ID 0 is for a boot device and is usually a hard drive. ID 1 is
   381	        normally used for a second hard drive, but this is not a require-
   382	        ment. Some host adapter BIOS' or software drivers will notify you
   383	        that the device for ID 0 is not a hard drive if another type of
   384	        device is using this ID. This is not an error, so don't be too
   385	        concerned with the message. ID 2 and up are normally used for
   386	        other devices with ID 2 being popular with CD ROM's. With the
   387	        exceptions of ID 0 and 7, there is no particular ID that *has*
   388	        to be assigned to any device type. Use what you want, the host
   389	        adapter will sort them out with ease.
   390	
   391	        Additionally, every ID can have up to seven sub-units identified
   392	        by a LUN (Logical Unit Number). Thus, you can address multiple
   393	        devices through one ID, like dual drives (Bernoulli did this on
   394	        their external Dual Bernoulli Boxes).
   395	        LUNs are mostly used in bridge controllers, that use the LUN-
   396	        subaddressing scheme to emulate a big disk drive with multiple
   397	        smaller disks. Up to eight disks could be combined to a big
   398	        disk drive, where the single drives are addressed by LUNs. A
   399	        special case of these bridge controllers are RAID controllers.
   400	
   401	        By using LUNs, theoretically you could attach 49 devices to one
   402	        bus cable (7 IDs * 7 LUNs, without ID 7 for the host adapter),
   403	        if you use all LUNs for specific devices. But LUNs are only very
   404	        seldom used in PC applications.
   405	
   406	
   407	2.2.    Termination
   408	
   409	        The SCSI bus needs to be "terminated". This means, both ends of
   410	        the bus must have a circuit of some sort to eliminate signal
   411	        reflections that would occur from the physical ends of the bus.
   412	        There are various circuit schemes of termination, the two most
   413	        popular are drawn below.
   414	        The termination circuit needs some power, and, to deliver this,
   415	        there is a line called TERMPWR or Termination Power on the bus.
   416	        Mostly, the TP source is the host adapter, for this reason you
   417	        can see fuses on most host adapters, mostly about 1.5 Amp types.
   418	
   419	        A more thorough diagram of the various termination
   420	        configurations is in App. C.
   421	
   422	
   423	2.2.1.  "Classic" Passive Termination
   424	
   425	        The "old" passive termination ("Alternative 1" in the SCSI-2
   426	        spec) came with SCSI-1 and simply was made of a 220 Ohms pull-up
   427	        and a 330 Ohms pull-down resistor per signal in a circuit like
   428	        this:

   443	
   444	        This termination scheme works good, but it draws a lot of power
   445	        from the TP provider.
   446	
   447	
   448	
   449	2.2.2.  Active Termination
   450	
   451	        Active termination ("Alternative 2" in the SCSI-2 spec) consists
   452	        of a 110 Ohms resistor per signal pulled up to a 2.85 volts power
   453	        supply. Most SCSI-2 and all Fast SCSI-2 devices support this
   454	        termination type.

   475	2.2.3.  Forced Perfect Termination (FPT)
   476	
   477	        There is another Termination scheme out there, called FPT.
   478	        According to what I  understand, it uses diode clamps to
   479	        two regulated voltages to eliminate under- and overshoot.
   480	        Clamp values should be at about 3.0 and 0.5 volts.
   481	        The clamping to two regulated voltages in the signal range
   482	        instead of clamping to TP and ground gives the diodes an
   483	        earlier switching point and thus enhances signal quality, as
   484	        the over- and undershoot elimination process begins earlier
   485	        in the signal.
   486	        From its concept, FPT should be even better than "normal"
   487	        active termination.
   488	        I have no real FPT circuit, as I have never seen a FPT terminator,
   489	        but the rough schematic below should be basically right.

   512	2.3.    SCSI Connectors
   513	
   514	        There are many different connectors for SCSI. Some of them were
   515	        defined with SCSI-1 and now obsolete, like the DB-50 connector.
   516	        The most common ones today are the 50-pin Centronics-type SCSI-1
   517	        connector, the 50-pin High Density SCSI-2 connector and the DB-25
   518	        connector Apple introduced on their Macintosh computers.
   519	        Most new host adapters and external devices use the SCSI-2 HD
   520	        connector and in this case you normally can trust that it's a
   521	        "real" SCSI-2 device.
   522	        The pinouts of the common connectors are shown in Appendix A.
   523	
   524	
   525	2.4.    Cables, Cable Lengths, Repeaters
   526	
   527	        Cable lenghts were defined up to 6 meters maximum in SCSI-1 for
   528	        a single-ended SCSI bus and up to 5 MHz data rate. So, the
   529	        variants
   530	
   531	        - "standard" asynchronous transfer (mostly up to 3.3 MBytes/sec)
   532	              -and-
   533	        - "standard" synchronous transfer (5 MBytes/sec)
   534	
   535	        can have up to these 6 meters _total_ cable length for the bus.
   536	        Keep this in mind, if you use long cables, and don't forget the
   537	        cable lengths for the internal device cables.
   538	        With Fast SCSI-2 the highest possible data rate doubled to 10MHz
   539	        in synchronous mode and - you might guess it - the cable length
   540	        was halved. So, if you use Fast SCSI-2 devices, your _maximal_
   541	        SCSI bus length is 3 meters.
   542	        SCSI-2 allows up to 10 cm cable "stub" length from the device
   543	        to the main bus cable. Sometimes this length is exceeded,
   544	        causing higher capacitive loading. Sometimes this even works,
   545	        for the maximal allowed stub length for any device-to-device
   546	        connection is 20 cm, but don't _expect_ that to work reliably
   547	        over 10 cm, especially with 10 MHz Fast SCSI-2 signalling.
   548	
   549	        A differential SCSI bus can use the full cable length up to 25
   550	        meters (approx. 82 feet) and keep the max. data rate of 10 MHz.
   551	        This is especially important with external devices, as most
   552	        external single-ended cables can't cope with 10 MHz.
   553	
   554	        All cables should have matching impedances - not easy (means
   555	        impossible) with flat and round cables on the same bus.
   556	
   557	        There are a lot of rules and rules-of-thumb for SCSI cables
   558	        that make a good external SCSI cable an _expensive_ cable.
   559	        The SCSI documents have lots of technical details about cabling.
   560	        For example, a three-layer wire-pair placement scheme with
   561	        defined impedance rules is recommended for external cables that
   562	        makes the cable not so easy (means expensive) to produce.
   563	        Therefore, there are a lot of external cables with too low
   564	        impedance in the 50 to 70 Ohms range instead of the recommended
   565	        90 to 110 Ohms.
   566	
   567	        In a few years of practice with SCSI, I saw a lot of errors and
   568	        faulty behaviour suddenly go away with a change to high-quality
   569	        cables.
   570	        Without trying to advertise - Amphenol seems to be one source of
   571	        high-end SCSI cables - at least Adaptec recommended them until
   572	        they started selling (very good !) cables themselves.
   573	
   574	        There are some "repeater" devices for SCSI that seem to work.
   575	        Basically, these are fast(!) bidirectional signal amplifiers
   576	        including termination for each side. Personally, i don't know
   577	        one, but iX, a german Unix magazine, mentioned a device called
   578	        "ACI-1074A" from a company called "Applied Concepts" - whoever
   579	        is this...
   580	
   581	
   582	2.5.    Signal levels
   583	
   584	        Single-Ended SCSI signal levels vary from 0V to +5.25V. All
   585	        signals are active low. True is a voltage level between 0 and
   586	        +0.8 V and false is a voltage between +2 and +5.25 V.
   587	        Differential SCSI signals conforms to the EIA RS-485 interface.
   588	
   589	
   590	2.6.    Single-Ended and Differential SCSI
   591	
   592	        There are two different electrical SCSI interfaces, Single-Ended
   593	        and Differential SCSI.
   594	        Single-Ended, "Standard" SCSI has (sic!) single ended TTL trans-
   595	        ceivers that allow up to 5 MHz data transfer rates with up to
   596	        6 meters cable length or up to 10 MHz data transfer (Fast SCSI)
   597	        with up to 3 meters cable length.
   598	        Differential SCSI has RS-485-style transceivers that allow up to
   599	        10 MHz data transfer rate, but with cable lengths up to 25 meters
   600	        and with much better S/N conditions.
   601	        Important is, Single-Ended and Differential devices are _not_
   602	        electrically compatible with each other. If you try to mix them,
   603	        you'll likely end up in destroying the Single-Ended devices on
   604	        the bus and - less probably - even the differential device(s).
   605

   607	2.7.    Synchronous and Asynchronous Transfers
   608	
   609	        SCSI can use two handshaking modes, Asynchronous and Synchronous.
   610	        The main difference is, Asynchronous is basically a "classic"
   611	        REQ/ACK handshaking system for each data packet, where with
   612	        Synchronous, multiple REQ's can be issued before receiving ACK's,
   613	        thus giving a big performance plus.
   614	
   615	
   616	2.8.    SCSI Disconnect / Reconnect
   617	
   618	        Typically, not all SCSI commands can be processed immediately.
   619	        For example, rewinding a tape or scanning a page with an image
   620	        scanner can take a long time, as can seeking to a sector on a
   621	        CD-ROM or hard disk.
   622	        Such operations can tie up the CPU unnecessarily while waiting
   623	        for the device to complete the task. For these cases, SCSI has
   624	        a defined way for a device to disconnect from the SCSI bus, thus
   625	        freeing the SCSI bus for other SCSI transactions or at least
   626	        freeing the CPU from being tied to the SCSI bus waiting for the
   627	        operation to complete.
   628	
   629	        When the disconnected device completes this operation, it can
   630	        reconnect to the bus, causing a hardware interrupt.
   631	        When this interrupt occurs, bus control is returned back to that
   632	        SCSI operation, which then completes.
   633	
   634	        This SCSI "disconnect/reconnect" mechanism provides overlapped
   635	        I/O functionality, thus allowing multiple outstanding SCSI
   636	        requests with different devices to be processed at the same
   637	        time. Especially with devices with higher typical command times,
   638	        this is a very valuable SCSI feature.
   639	
   640	
   641	2.9.    SCSI or IDE/ATAPI ?
   642	
   643	        Much is talked about SCSI speed higher or lower than ESDI or
   644	        ATAPI. This discussion generally only covers disk drives, without
   645	        comparing the system in terms of performance or flexibility.
   646	
   647	        At work, over years I've tested a lot of disk drives with ATAPI
   648	        and SCSI versions against each other, and generally, you won't
   649	        find much difference in speed between the various interfaces,
   650	        as they all are fast enough to handle disk drives. Also, I've
   651	        seen a lot of comparisons where the contenders were choosen
   652	        accordingly to the opinion they should prove.
   653	        Personally, I find it of more interest that SCSI, as a universal
   654	        8-bit interface, without problems reaches the speed of a 16-bit
   655	        disk interface like ATAPI.
   656	        For both interfaces deliver similar speed, I believe the "SCSI
   657	        is faster/better" - "NO! ATAPI is faster/better" debate
   658	        completely misses the point.
   659	        If just a disk interface is needed for a desktop PC, IDE/ATAPI
   660	        is significantly cheaper, mainly for it's mass production and
   661	        the cheaper adapters.
   662	        If it comes to multiple devices as CDROM, tapes or scanners,
   663	        this changes. SCSI is _very_ flexible here, and today, drivers
   664	        are not the problem they were in the past. Also, the ongoing
   665	        SCSI integration in motherboards will drop SCSI cost.
   666	        So, the battle is still open <g>. Skip Lutz says the battle is
   667	        long over and the SCSI Warriors are running around stabbing the
   668	        wounded, so you decide which way it went. <VBG>
   669	
   670	
   671	2.10.   Speed considerations
   672	
   673	        A small maximal speed table for the SCSI transfer modes could
   674	        read like this:
   675	
   676	        Transfer type           Bits    Speed/Data rate
   677	
   678	        Asynchronous             8       3.3 MBytes/sec
   679	        Synchronous              8       5.0 MBytes/sec
   680	        Fast Synchronous         8      10.0 MBytes/sec
   681	        Wide Synchronous        16      10.0 MBytes/sec
   682	        Fast Wide Synchronous   16      20.0 MBytes/sec
   683	        Wide Synchronous        32      20.0 MBytes/sec
   684	        Fast Wide Synchronous   32      40.0 MBytes/sec
   685	
   686	        When reading things like "data rate buffer-to-bus 10 MB/sec"
   687	        with SCSI devices, keep in mind that this doesn't mean the real
   688	        sustained data rate your hard disk or CDROM can deliver - it's
   689	        just the speed the device can post its cache contents to the
   690	        SCSI bus. With hard disks, you will mostly find statements like
   691	        "internal data rate 30-47 MBit/s", what would mean in this
   692	        example, the disk drive could transfer 5,875 MBytes/sec raw data
   693	        internal. But this value cannot be reached - you'll loose some
   694	        speed due to the disk architecture: If you have a disk drive with
   695	        60 sectors per track and 5400 rpm, the value could be not better
   696	        than:  ( sectors * bytes/sector * rpm ) / seconds per minute,
   697	                  (60    *   512        * 5400) / 60   = 2,765 MBytes/sec
   698	        Add to this some command overhead, head movement times and so on,
   699	        then you get an impression, how realistic these values are ...
   700	        Another good example are CDROM drives - my Toshiba 3401 has
   701	        330 kB/sec sustained data rate, but its burst data rate can go
   702	        up to 4.2 MB/sec in synchronous mode.
   703	
   704	
   705	3.      SCSI and PC's
   706	
   707	        PC-specific SCSI standards include mostly software depending on
   708	        the operating system. However, if you choose SCSI for your PC,
   709	        think about your needs before buying a SCSI host adapter.
   710	
   711	3.1.    Software Interfaces
   712	
   713	        Besides various vendor-specific implementations like, for
   714	        example, Bernoullis OAD (Open Architecture Drivers) there are
   715	        a few vendor-independent standards:
   716	
   717	        - ASPI for DOS, OS/2 and Netware
   718	        - CAM/SCAM for DOS (and OS/2 ?)
   719	        - LADDR for OS/2 1.x
   720	
   721	3.1.1.  ASPI
   722	
   723	        ASPI stands for Advanced SCSI Programming Interface. Mainly, it
   724	        originated at Adaptec and was soon adopted by major companies.
   725	        ASPI provides a communication layer to the SCSI adapter and the
   726	        devices without the need to know about the host adapter - all
   727	        communication is made to the ASPI interface. So, basically the
   728	        host adapter manufacturer writes an ASPI driver for his host
   729	        adapter and he's in business without the need of writing a new
   730	        CDROM driver, a disk driver and so on.
   731	        Most actual tape backup software needs ASPI as a communication
   732	        layer or - at least - support it.
   733	        ASPI generally exists for DOS, OS/2 and NetWare. Also, Adaptec
   734	        supplies ASPI for Windows with their host adapters, and ASPI for
   735	        Win32 should follow soon. I could see ASPI for Windows support
   736	        only with Adaptec controllers, but other manufacturers should
   737	        (hopefully) follow soon. What's missing (imho) is an ASPI layer
   738	        for Unix... But this seems not so easy with Unix's kernel/driver
   739	        concept.
   740	
   741	3.1.2.  CAM
   742	
   743	        CAM is the "official" ANSI software interface for SCSI devices.
   744	        I'm not absolutely sure if it's a draft or a standard yet.
   745	        However, it seems to be used only by NCR and Future Domain with
   746	        their SCSI host adapters, and at least FD supplies an additional
   747	        ASPI-over-CAM driver with their boards.
   748	
   749	3.1.3.  SDMS
   750	
   751	        NCR now calls its CAM drivers NCR SCSI Device Management System
   752	        (SDMS). SDMS is based on a standard SCSI BIOS, that can be ROM-
   753	        (bootable) or RAM-based (non-bootable) to address the host
   754	        adapter hardware. The SCSI drivers link to this BIOS. Generally,
   755	        a SDMS driver is completely hardware-independant. One special
   756	        case with SDMS is that NCR also offers so-called "concatenated"
   757	        SCSI device drivers, where a SCSI-chip specific SCSI BIOS is
   758	        appended to the driver code.
   759	        See also - CAM drivers for DOS
   760	
   761	
   762	3.1.4.  LADDR
   763	
   764	        LADDR was Microsoft and IBM's (and others like Adaptec and
   765	        Compaq...) approach to embed a disk driver and SCSI interface
   766	        into OS/2 1.2 and 1.3. For OS/2 1.x's small market share and
   767	        LADDR's limitation to a single OS, it didn't get bigger
   768	        acceptance and ha been replaced by direct SCSI support
   769	        beginning with OS/2, version 2.0.
   770	        The concept wasn't bad, however. LADDR (LAyered Device DRiver)
   771	        support was built in OS/2 1.3 (and it was possible to integrate
   772	        it in 1.2).
   773	
   774	        A concept diagram would look like this:
   775

   790	
   791	        Module types were:
   792	
   793	        BID - Bus Interface Driver, the host adapter specific driver
   794	
   795	        VSD - Vendor Specific Driver, drivers to modify or enhance the
   796	              operation of specific peripherals. VSD's were used to add
   797	              features or correct incompatibilities with devices.
   798	
   799	        TSD - Type Specific Driver, the driver for a specific type of
   800	              peripheral, for example CDROM drives
   801	
   802	        The drivers were:
   803	
   804	        - BASEDD01.SYS, IOS12.sys, IOCONFIG.SYS, all from Microsoft, for
   805	          implementing LADDR.
   806	
   807	        - a host adapter .BID file, for example WD7000AX.BID. Some of
   808	          these came with OS/2, otherwise were available from the host
   809	          adapter vendors.
   810	
   811	        - STDDISK.VSD and DISK.TSD, both from Microsoft, for disk
   812	          integration.
   813	
   814	        - CDROM.VSD, CDROM.TSD and CDROM.FSD, all from Microsoft, for
   815	          CDROM operation.
   816	
   817	        - correct .VSD and .TSD modules for addressing tape devices or
   818	          other SCSI devices.
   819	
   820	        If you look at the actual driver concept in OS/2 2.x, you will
   821	        see that isn't much difference - mostly just the names changed.
   822	
   823	3.2.    Host Adapters - Variants and Terminology
   824	
   825	        There are some flavors of SCSI host adapters; with and without
   826	        BIOS, with or without cache, ISA 8 Bit or 16 Bit, EISA, VL and
   827	        PCI bus interfaces, SCSI-IDE combo adapters, standalone or
   828	        integrated with sound cards, disk-only adapters, and, and ....
   829	        Let's try to bring some light in here ...
   830	
   831	3.2.1.  BIOS: If you want to boot from a SCSI device, you need a SCSI
   832	        BIOS, that handles the boot process, for a standard PC BIOS
   833	        doesn't know anything about SCSI. This BIOS handles the interface
   834	        between SCSI's Logical Block addressing scheme and the PC's
   835	        Cylinder/Head/Sector scheme.
   836	
   837	3.2.2.  Bus mastering: Some PC host adapters use "DMA Bus mastering" to
   838	        achieve higher data rates from the SCSI host adapter's buffer to
   839	        system memory. Bus mastering is a method to move data over the
   840	        system bus by bypassing the CPU and giving control over the bus
   841	        to the peripheral controller, so that the bus can be used up to
   842	        its maximal data rate without the CPU overhead of a 'normal' I/O
   843	        transfer. On ISA PCs, don't forget that ISA doesn't have logic
   844	        to prevent concurrent bus master accesses, so having - for
   845	        example - an Adaptec 1542 and a busmastering network adapter
   846	        like the NE2100 will give you sudden lockups and other trouble.
   847	        Also, remember that an ISA card can "see" only 16MB RAM on the
   848	        bus, so, with a busmastering ISA adapter and more than 16MB
   849	        RAM, you also may have trouble. All this are additional points
   850	        for EISA, VL and PCI bus systems.
   851	
   852	3.2.3.  Cache host adapters: a hardware cache is a good method to speed
   853	        up the disk interface. However, you should define if your
   854	        environment can benefit from a hardware cache _before_ buying it.
   855	        The pro-cache and the anti-cache societies fight "holy" wars
   856	        about cacheing, so please allow me to clarify that the following
   857	        is my _personal_ opinion on this theme:
   858	
   859	        A cache controller is a good investment for multitasking environ-
   860	        ments like Unix and especially Network servers. With DOS, it's
   861	        generally better to spend the money for main RAM than for cache
   862	        RAM and use a software cache.
   863	        My personal experiences are: DPT 2012 and AMI EISA SCSI adapters
   864	        in Novell and NFS Servers brought _big_ performance gains,
   865	        especially with heavy-loaded servers.
   866	        In DOS systems, a performance gain was visible, but it didn't
   867	        equalize the price tag, especially with the expensive EISA cache
   868	        controllers. However, this may differ with different cache
   869	        controllers, as the possible performance gain is strongly
   870	        dependent on the cache algorithm.
   871	
   872	3.2.4.  Sound cards with SCSI: There are basically two types of them:
   873	        one has a full-fledged SCSI adapter integrated on the PCB,
   874	        without any difference to a standard SCSI host adapter without
   875	        BIOS. One example for this type is the SoundBlaster 16/SCSI,
   876	        with an Adaptec SCSI chip on the board. The other variant I know
   877	        about is the ProAudio Spectrum with a SCSI interface, that's
   878	        "embedded" into the sound card ports.
   879	        The PAS type is limited in speed, but not in SCSI functionality.
   880	        If you get standard drivers for them, they all give you full
   881	        SCSI capabilities, but you can't boot from them. If you want to
   882	        boot from a SCSI disk, you need a full-fledged SCSI adapter with
   883	        BIOS. New in the market is Adaptec's SCSI Audio Machine AMM 1570.
   884	
   885	        It combines a sound card and a full-featured host adapter with
   886	        SCSI BIOS. Its sound part implements General MIDI, but i wasn't
   887	        impressed by its sound quality compared with my PAS and
   888	        especially the TurtleBeach. The SCSI part seems a bit slow
   889	        compared with a standard SCSI adapter and i don't like that it
   890	        has jumpers. To me, it seems a bit too expensive with a list
   891	        price of about $500 here in Germany.
   892	        However, it's a full-featured and bootable SCSI host adapter
   893	        and sound board in one package. For the idea seems good, it
   894	        should get competitors soon.
   895	
   896	3.2.5.  Disk-only SCSI host adapters: Mostly the Seagate ST-01 and ST-02.
   897	        These adapters had their time when SCSI was a new disk interface.
   898	        As they could be used only for disks and didn't have standard
   899	        drivers for ASPI or CAM, they soon became obsolete.
   900	
   901	3.2.6.  ISA, EISA, VL and PCI: clearly the PC bus affect system
   902	        performance. As for example the Adaptec 1542 supports DMA bus
   903	        mastering speeds up to 10 MByte/sec, it would be fast enough
   904	        for Fast SCSI-2. However, most ISA designs support only 5MB/sec
   905	        DMA speed, so the ISA bus is a bottleneck with fast SCSI devices.
   906	        EISA busmasters can transfer up to 33MBytes/sec over the bus, so
   907	        in this case you really can benefit from faster devices, as the
   908	        bottleneck is the device or the SCSI bus here.
   909	        The same is true for VL and PCI SCSI host adapters. Also, if
   910	        you want to have more than 16MB of RAM, you bypass some
   911	        potential problems with the more advanced bus systems. (see
   912	        also 3.2.2. - Bus mastering)
   913	        PCI boards have a speciality: Normally the SCSI BIOS is part of
   914	        the SCSI adapter, but there are PCI boards with SDMS (NCR SCSI
   915	        Device Management System) support in the BIOS, but without SCSI
   916	        chip. So, for these boards, you can get cheap PCI SCSI adapters
   917	        without BIOS, only with the NCR 53C810 chip on it, but never-
   918	        theless bootable from a SCSI disk. So, with a PCI board, the
   919	        best choice is one with the SCSI chip on it.
   920	
   921	3.2.7.  PCMCIA and Parallel-to-SCSI adapters: I have very limited
   922	        experience with both of these; Personally I use a Trantor
   923	        T348, at the office there are some different parallel-to-SCSI
   924	        devices. All of them work and all share the same experiences.
   925	        My Trantor T348 seems to be a stable and - if the parallel
   926	        port allows it - fast SCSI interface. A friend of mine uses
   927	        this T348 for backing up his notebook to a DAT tape and this
   928	        works without flaws.
   929	        However, the T348 and its pre- and successors T338 and T358
   930	        (an EPP variant of the T348) need a SCSI device that provides
   931	        termination power, as they draw their operating current from
   932	        the SCSI bus. This may give you problems, as normally I disable
   933	        termination power on my external devices, for only one device
   934	        on the bus (normally the host adapter) should provide TP.
   935	        Keeping this in mind and acting accordingly, Parallel-to-SCSI
   936	        adapters seem to be a possible solution for attaching SCSI
   937	        devices to a system without a SCSI adapter, but they are limited
   938	        in speed, especially with parallel ports that work only uni-
   939	        directional.
   940	        PCMCIA - I never used a PCMCIA SCSI adapter, so I can't comment
   941	        on them. However, with the full PCMCIA driver set on my Toshiba
   942	        needing about 130 kB of memory, plus the SCSI drivers, I can't
   943	        take PCMCIA too serious with DOS, especially when working with
   944	        SCSI or network drivers. OS/2 should solve this problem, though,
   945	        as memory isn't a primary concern there.
   946	
   947	4.      SCSI and the real Life ...
   948	
   949	        In real life, theory is just a list of things that shouldn't
   950	        happen <g>.
   951	        So, let's collect some experiences and comment about them ...
   952	
   953	4.1.    Installing a SCSI host adapter
   954	
   955	        Basically, a SCSI host adapter is a standard PC board, regardless
   956	        of the bus system used. As an example, let's follow my standard
   957	        installation of an Adaptec 1542CF:
   958	
   959	        First, look at the default values of the board and verify that
   960	        it doesn't collide with other devices in your PC.
   961	        Of course, you may have some other device in your PC that will
   962	        bring you problems later, but first we just want to see if there
   963	        is some obvious reason why it wouldn't work. So, control the
   964	        I/O-address range, the IRQ(s), DMA channel, and the BIOS address
   965	        for conflicts. Also, if you use a memory manager, exclude the
   966	        chosen BIOS address space from its memory pool.
   967	        If you have chosen all resources, enter them in your list of
   968	        ressources. If you don't have one for your PC, it's a good idea
   969	        to start one now.
   970	        If all is ok, install the host adapter in the PC and turn it on
   971	        again. If you didn't deinstall the BIOS, you will see a BIOS boot
   972	        message like:
   973	
   974	             Adaptec AHA-1540CF/1542CF BIOS 2.01s

   979	             Target #0 -   DEC       DSP3085S-B SD16    - Drive C: (80h)
   980	             Target #1 -   QUANTUM   LP425S   606_      - Drive D: (81h)
   981	
   982	        The boot-up message will list all devices that are on the SCSI
   983	        bus and turned on. Also, it will show you if any of them are
   984	        disks that are supported by the BIOS.
   985	
   986	        Now, it's the best time to start any test programs that are in
   987	        the BIOS. With the 1542CF, there is a DMA transfer test program
   988	        you can use to test the maximal DMA speed your motherboard can
   989	        safely use.
   990	        So, press <Ctrl><A> if the BIOS tells you to do so, select the
   991	        host adapter's base address (normally it will be preset) and
   992	        press the <Enter> key.
   993	        Select "Host Adapter Diagnostics" and press Enter. If the test
   994	        runs for some time without problems (i normally use 3 passes),
   995	        you see that the DMA speed is on the safe side.
   996	        Now, turn off the PC and install the SCSI device(s). If you have
   997	        more than one internal device,
   998	        - set up a unique SCSI ID ( _not_ 7 ) on each of the devices and
   999	        - select one of these devices to be at the end of the cable.
  1000	        Make sure that the choosen device has its termination enabled and
  1001	        disable termination on all other devices. Termination is either
  1002	        enabled through one or more jumpers, or simply by installing or
  1003	        removing some resistor packs on the device's PCB. Now, attach the
  1004	        SCSI cable to the host adapter and to the last device. Don't
  1005	        forget the device's power connector.
  1006	
  1007	        Turn the PC on and watch if the SCSI device is being recognized
  1008	        by the host adapter. If yes, ok, turn off the PC and install the
  1009	        next device. Watch for the recognition again and install .......
  1010	        If all devices are recognized, install the EZSCSI driver package.
  1011	        From this point on, you should be up and running.
  1012	
  1013	        If you did deinstall the BIOS, or if it's a simple host adapter
  1014	        without BIOS, you will not see any reaction until you install the
  1015	        drivers.
  1016	
  1017	        Of course, in real life, you will install all devices at once
  1018	        and in most cases all will work ok. The above is just the correct
  1019	        way I tell the new technicians <g>.
  1020	
  1021	
  1022	4.2.    Installing SCSI devices.
  1023	
  1024	4.2.1.  Setting proper termination
  1025	
  1026	        Remember - the basic rule is: Termination on both ends of the
  1027	        SCSI chain. So, if you want to install the new device as the
  1028	        last device on one of the sides of the _complete_ cable, you
  1029	        need to enable termination on it. If it replaces another device
  1030	        that was at the end of the cable before and now is installed on
  1031	        another connector on the bus, you also have to disable the
  1032	        termination on this device.
  1033	        If you install an external SCSI device, but you had only
  1034	        internal devices so far, you also have to disable your host
  1035	        adapter's termination. This might be done by software, as with
  1036	        the newer Adaptecs, or by removing the (mostly three) terminator
  1037	        packs near the host adapter's SCSI connector, or by setting a
  1038	        jumper on the host adapter. Clearly, the same occurs, if you get
  1039	        your first internal device and had external devices before.
  1040	
  1041	4.2.2.  Finding out and setting the SCSI ID of the new device
  1042	
  1043	        First you have to find out a free SCSI ID. The best method for
  1044	        this is simple - look at your host adapters bootup message and
  1045	        look for free IDs.
  1046

  1052	             Target #0 -   DEC       DSP3085S-B SD16    - Drive C: (80h)
  1053	             Target #1 -   QUANTUM   LP425S   606_      - Drive D: (81h)
  1054	             Target #3 -   TOSHIBA   CD-ROM XM-3301T
  1055	             Target #4 -   SDI       LASERSTOR  E5
  1056	
  1057	        In this example, IDs 2, 5 and 6 are free for new devices. You
  1058	        can't use ID 7, as this is the host adapter.
  1059	
  1060	        On internal devices, the ID is normally set by three jumpers in
  1061	        a 4-2-1 configuration. The sum of the jumper values counts for
  1062	        the ID. So, if you want a hard disk at ID 0, remove all three
  1063	        ID jumpers, if they are set. For ID 1, jou must set the jumper
  1064	        with value 1, mostly called ID0, where the "2" jumper is called
  1065	        ID1 and the "4" jumper is called ID2.
  1066	        If you play with Wide SCSI, you will have 4 (8-4-2-1) or even
  1067	        5 (16-8-4-2-1) jumpers for ID selection.
  1068	
  1069	4.3.    What can be wrong?
  1070	
  1071	        Basically - all <g>. However, if I should make a list about
  1072	        problems I found or had at various offices and systems, there
  1073	        are some all-time highs and standard cases:
  1074	
  1075	          - unstable termination, passive termination with Fast-SCSI,
  1076	            very rare: active termination with old SCSI devices.
  1077	          - wrong termination (too much devices terminated or SCSI bus
  1078	            ends not terminated correctly)
  1079	          - self-made short flat ribbon cables with bad contacts
  1080	          - using Fast-SCSI with cheap external round cables
  1081	          - too long cables, especially with adding Fast SCSI
  1082	            devices to an existing, stable SCSI system
  1083	          - setting the new device to a used ID
  1084	          - using a SCSI adapter that doesn't provide term. power
  1085	            (or disabled) and having no device set to provide it.
  1086	
  1087	4.3.1.  Cabling with "Standard" SCSI
  1088	
  1089	        SCSI-1 and "Standard" SCSI-2 normally isn't very picky with
  1090	        its cabling. However, there are a few traps you could stumble
  1091	        in...
  1092	        The mixing of flat and round cables gives impedance changes
  1093	        that could lead into problems. Normally, you will use flat
  1094	        cable or twisted pair flat cable inside and round cables for
  1095	        external cabling. This normally works. Some times, when we
  1096	        tested different configurations, adding another "quick and
  1097	        dirty" flat cable to the external chain, it didn't work ...
  1098	        changing the flat cable to be the first cable after the
  1099	        controller sometimes did the trick.
  1100	        However, SCSI cabling is a sensitive thing, so, if I encounter
  1101	        strange problems, I look for correct termination first and for
  1102	        the cables directly after this.
  1103	        I've got some configurations outside that worked only after we
  1104	        changed the _complete_ cabling to flat cable.
  1105	
  1106	        If you buy external cables, you will see that 30 cm is the
  1107	        _minimal_ length you can buy - if you can find these cables.
  1108	
  1109	4.3.2.  Cabling with Fast SCSI
  1110	
  1111	        Other that SCSI-1, Fast SCSI is _very_ picky with its cables.
  1112	        If you buy a system from a "better" vendor, you will often see
  1113	        twisted-pair signal cables also for the internal cabling. This
  1114	        makes much sense, as the signal/noise ratio is better with this.
  1115	        With Fast SCSI, the allowed SCSI bus length drops to 3 meters
  1116	        including the internal cables. Keep this in mind if you install
  1117	        Fast-SCSI devices, or, if you have the choice, select a Twin-
  1118	        channel SCSI host adapter like, for example, Adaptec's 2742T
  1119	        instead of the standard 2742.
  1120	
  1121	
  1122	4.3.3.  Termination and Termination Power
  1123	
  1124	        The termination basic rule is simple - both ends of the SCSI
  1125	        chain. However, i had some cases whereIi got a system up and
  1126	        running only if I apply Termination on both ends _and_ on the
  1127	        host adapter.
  1128	        I have such a setup in my home system - HD, tape and CDROM
  1129	        internal, the internal end terminated with an active terminator,
  1130	        the 1542CF terminated (active), MO and scanner external and
  1131	        terminated with an active terminator, high-end cables, 2 meters
  1132	        all in all, only the 1542CF supplies termination power - all
  1133	        perfect. But when I turn off the host adapter's termination,
  1134	        _nothing_ works!
  1135	        So, don't be scared if a setup works that shouldn't - I verify
  1136	        it again and if it works, try to live with it.
  1137	
  1138	        PS: last week (september '94) this suddenly changed - no device
  1139	        or cable was changed, but the system suddenly refused to boot
  1140	        and i had to disable the adapter's termination - now the
  1141	        termination scheme is correct, but i don't know why it didn't
  1142	        work before ..... -Gerhard

  1144	
  1145	4.4.    SCSI drivers on PCs
  1146	
  1147	        If you attach only hard disks to a SCSI adapter, you mostly
  1148	        won't need to install drivers, as hard disks are managed by
  1149	        the BIOS, except in some special cases.
  1150	        However, to access SCSI devices other than hard disks, you
  1151	        need some drivers. What drivers you need, depends on your host
  1152	        adapter, your operating system, your driver package and your
  1153	        devices. However, with any software interface there are some
  1154	        generic rules:
  1155	
  1156	        - You need a hardware-specific part, that talks to your host
  1157	          adapter's SCSI chip.
  1158	        - Based on this hardware-specific part, there are some device-
  1159	          specific parts, that sit on the hardware-driver to talk to
  1160	          their supported devices.
  1161	        - On this device-dependant drivers, there _could_ be some
  1162	          application-specific parts.
  1163	
  1164	4.4.1.  ASPI drivers for DOS
  1165	
  1166	        With ASPI, in first place you need an ASPI manager for your
  1167	        host adapter. This driver is the hardware dependant part of
  1168	        your driver package. For example, with an Adaptec 154x adapter
  1169	        in your PC, you will need to install ASPI4DOS.SYS. With a DPT
  1170	        SCSI host adapter, it would be DPTDDL.SYS, with a QLOGIC host
  1171	        adapter it would be QLASPI.SYS and so on ...
  1172	        After this driver is installed, the ASPI interface can be used
  1173	        by all sort of device drivers. For example, to address a CDROM
  1174	        drive, you could use Adaptec's ASPICD.SYS or Trantor's TSLCD.SYS
  1175	        (only the ASPI-based version from SCSIWorks!). You could use
  1176	        ASPIDISK.SYS to address removeable devices (Bernoullis, MO's ...)
  1177	        or hard disks, if your SCSI BIOS doesn't support them or isn't
  1178	        installed. Let's look at my DOS config.sys file to see some of
  1179	        these drivers:
  1180	
  1181	
  1182	        Don't mind the parameters that I don't explain at the moment.
  1183	        They're specific to my setup or hardware. Also, the path
  1184	        C:\DOS\SCSI is the path i installed the drivers on my system.
  1185	        The values in brackets on the right side of the DEVICE=.. lines
  1186	        are the memory consumption of these drivers on my main system.
  1187	
  1188	          DEVICE=C:\DOS\SCSI\ASPI4DOS.SYS /D                     [ 8 kB]
  1189	               This is the ASPI manager for my Adaptec 1542CF. It does
  1190	               basically nothing but providing the ASPI interface. The
  1191	               /D-parameter gives some additional information at startup.
  1192	
  1193	          DEVICE=C:\DOS\SCSI\ASPIDISK.SYS /D /R1                 [ 5 kB]
  1194	               This driver supports removeable-media devices like my
  1195	               Bernoulli 90Pro removeable disk and the Maxoptix Tahiti
  1196	               Magneto-Optical drive.
  1197	
  1198	          DEVICE=C:\DOS\SCSI\aspicd.SYS /D:ASPICD0               [12 kB]
  1199	               ASPICD.SYS is the device driver for a SCSI CDROM drive.
  1200	               The /D:ASPICD0 parameter installs the CDROM driver with
  1201	               the device name "ASPICD0". This _exact_ name is needed
  1202	               later for MSCDEX.EXE in Autoexec.bat.
  1203	               The same parameters could be used with other CDROM
  1204	               drivers, for example Toshiba's MDSCD_AS.SYS or
  1205	               Trantor's TSLCDR.SYS.
  1206	
  1207	          DEVICE=C:\DOS\SCSI\EPSN.SYS 3 /i79 /S6                 [ 3 kB]
  1208	               EPSN.SYS is the driver to address my EPSON scanner.
  1209	               A HP Scanjet II series scanner could be similar
  1210	               supported with a line like DEVICE=C:\DOS\SCSI\SJIIX.SYS.
  1211	
  1212	        The CDROM driver needs an additional part in DOS's Autoexec.bat
  1213	        file, MSCDEX.EXE, to enable access to the CDROM's filesystem
  1214	        to DOS. The corresponding line in Autoexec.bat is:
  1215	
  1216	          C:\DOS\MSCDEX.EXE /D:ASPICD0 /L:T /M:0                 [23 kB]
  1217	
  1218	        This line installs the CDROM Extension and needs _exact_ the
  1219	        same drivername after the /D: parameter that you used with the
  1220	        CDROM driver in Config.sys. /L:T tells MSCDEX to install the
  1221	        CDROM on drive letter T:, /M:0 means no buffers are set up, for
  1222	        i use DOS 6.2's SMARTDRV cache also on my CDROM.
  1223	
  1224	
  1225	4.4.2.  CAM drivers for DOS
  1226	
  1227	        The driver scheme for CAM is very similar to ASPI: a CAM shell
  1228	        driver as first driver, then various possible drivers: a CDROM
  1229	        driver, a driver for removeable disks and hard disks that are
  1230	        not supported by the BIOS and other specific drivers.
  1231	
  1232	        Although standardized, CAM seems to exist in various flavours.
  1233	        With NCR, you normally get a CAM driver, a DISKIDD.SYS driver
  1234	        for removeable media and one generic ore some device-specific
  1235	        CDROM drivers. With a 53C9x chip-based adapter for example, you
  1236	        probably would have CAMC9X.SYS, CDROM.SYS and DISKIDD.SYS.
  1237	        With the 53C7xx and 53C8xx chips, the drivers changed slightly.
  1238	        With them, (at least i think so!) NCR introduced SDMS, their
  1239	        SCSI Device Management System. The SDMS kernel is mostly in the
  1240	        host adapter's or PC's BIOS, the CAM drivers are only needed
  1241	        if you want to use CAM or ASPI for attaching other devices.
  1242	        Now there are DOSCAM.SYS and MINICAM.SYS, ASPICAM.SYS, CDROM.SYS
  1243	        and SCSIDISK.SYS. According to NCR's driver text files, the main
  1244	        difference between DOSCAM.SYS and MINICAM.SYS is that DOSCAM
  1245	        supports synchronous transfers, Tagged command queuing, SCSI
  1246	        Disconnect/Reconnect and multithreading, where MINICAM.SYS
  1247	        doesn't support these "advanced" SCSI functions.
  1248	        A typical set of Config.sys entries for NCR-based host adapters
  1249	        could look like the following:
  1250	
  1251	        DEVICE=C:\DOSCAM.SYS .......
  1252	                the CAM 3.0 base driver
  1253	
  1254	        DEVICE=C:\ASPICAM.SYS
  1255	                NCR's ASPI shell over CAM. After loading this driver,
  1256	                you can use all CAM or ASPI-based applications.
  1257	
  1258	        DEVICE=C:\SCSIDISK.SYS .......
  1259	                NCR's disk driver for removeable drives or drives with
  1260	                sector sizes other than 512 bytes. Also needed if you
  1261	                want to address more than seven SCSI drives with DOS 5+.
  1262	
  1263	        DEVICE=C:\CDROM.SYS .......
  1264	                The generic CDROM driver. Its syntax is exactly as
  1265	                described above with ASPICD.SYS.
  1266	
  1267	4.4.3.  SCSI drivers for OS/2
  1268	
  1269	        With OS/2 2.0, things went easier. The only host adapter
  1270	        specific part is the .ADD driver. SCSI, ASPI and CDROM support
  1271	        are standard with OS/2 2.x.
  1272	
  1273	        The following excerpt is from my OS/2 config.sys:
  1274	
  1275	          BASEDEV=OS2DASD.DMD
  1276	                This is OS/2's hard disk driver
  1277	
  1278	          DEVICE=C:\OS2\OS2CDROM.DMD /Q
  1279	          IFS=C:\OS2\CDFS.IFS /Q
  1280	                These two entries install CDROM support and the CDROM
  1281	                file system.
  1282	
  1283	          BASEDEV=xxxxxx.FLT
  1284	                If neccessary, you can install the appropriate .FLT
  1285	                file here for your CD-ROM drive, i.e. Hitachi.FLT.
  1286	
  1287	          BASEDEV=OS2SCSI.DMD
  1288	                This is the generic SCSI support driver.
  1289	
  1290	          BASEDEV=AHA154X.ADD /v
  1291	                This is the host adapter driver, in this case the
  1292	                .ADD module for my Adaptec 1542CF. The /v parameter
  1293	                gives some informatio about the attached devices at
  1294	                startup.
  1295	
  1296	          BASEDEV=OS2ASPI.DMD /all
  1297	                This is the OS/2 ASPI driver. The parameter /all is
  1298	                specific to Adaptec's VASPI driver set i use and
  1299	                doesn't apply on the standard OS2ASPI.DMD.
  1300	
  1301	          DEVICE=C:\OS2\MDOS\VASPI.SYS
  1302	                This is the virtual ASPI driver for the DOS-VDM's. This
  1303	                is also part of Adaptec's Virtual ASPI implementation.
  1304	
  1305	          DEVICE=C:\OS2\OPTICAL.SYS
  1306	                This is IBM's driver for Magneto-Optical drives.
  1307	                Officially it is designed for 128 MB 3«" drives, but
  1308	                it also works with other MO's like my Maxoptix Tahiti.
  1309	
  1310	        In the meantime there are some Shareware and PD extensions to
  1311	        OS/2 SCSI. One of these is Andreas Kaiser's ASPITAPE/SCSITAPE
  1312	        driver package with GNU TAR. The two entries here support tape
  1313	        backup to SCSI tapes under OS/2.
  1314	
  1315	          set TAPE=+++TAPE$2
  1316	          basedev=scsitape.dmd TAPE$2 2 S1
  1317	
  1318	        If you get a new SCSI .ADD driver, you need to install it in
  1319	        OS/2's CONFIG.SYS file. There are two possible ways to install
  1320	        the driver. Either you install the driver via OS/2's "Selective
  1321	        Install" command - you'll need a matching .DDP file for the
  1322	        driver -, or you include it into Config.sys manually. See your
  1323	        OS/2 documentation or the driver's readme file for better
  1324	        information.
  1325	
  1326	5.      SCSI driver software (and where to find it)
  1327	
  1328	        Some thoughts about SCSI utilities and software here....
  1329	        Most driver packages come with disk formatting utilities and
  1330	        some other stuff. However, there are some other packages and
  1331	        general utilities.
  1332	
  1333	5.1.    Driver packages
  1334	
  1335	        The best known SCSI driver packages (at least for me) are Corel
  1336	        SCSI, Adaptec's EZSCSI, Trantor's SCSIWorks and Future Domain's
  1337	        PowerSCSI!. Of course, there are many others I can't mention -
  1338	        I simply don't know about them.
  1339	
  1340	        Most versions of these packages I've seen all include various
  1341	        ASPI or CAM and ASPI drivers, additional drivers like CDROM
  1342	        and hard disk drivers and some basic utilities like low level
  1343	        formatter and partition manager.
  1344	
  1345	        Lately the vendors tend to add some value to the packages:
  1346	
  1347	        EZSCSI 3.0, for example, bundles the drivers with Windows ASPI
  1348	        driver and DLL, a PhotoCD viewer, various help files and a tape
  1349	        backup program, CD players and a SCSI interrogator. Also, a HP
  1350	        scanner driver for the SJIIx series is included, although this
  1351	        seem to be a bit unstable with the actual ASPI driver versions.
  1352	        So, it seems to be worth a try to use the ASPI driver from
  1353	        EZSCSI 2.03 when using a HP scanner with these adapters.
  1354	
  1355	        Corel SCSI, a more hardware-independent approach, can "sit" on
  1356	        the vendor's ASPI driver (it supplies a lot of these, also for
  1357	        manufacturers that don't have ASPI drivers of their own) to
  1358	        give support for CDROM, scanners, disks, tapes and nearly
  1359	        whatever devices are there...
  1360	        Even CDROM burners and SCSI printers have some support.
  1361	
  1362	        The last version of SCSIWorks! i've seen also has a HP scanner
  1363	        driver and includes TapeMate II, a relative good tape backup
  1364	        program for DOS.
  1365	
  1366	        Future Domain's PowerSCSI! contains CAM drivers for their host
  1367	        adapters, a CDROM driver and CD-Audio tool, a disk formatter and
  1368	        a SCSI device analyzer - nice tool if you have a FD adapter.
  1369	
  1370	        There is also a $40 shareware SCSI driver package called MSDRVR
  1371	        from a japanese company called "Micro Staff" with ASPI-based
  1372	        disk, MO and CDROM drivers on CompuServe. I didn't try it, but
  1373	        it may be worth a look (MSDRVR.ZIP, IBMHW forum).
  1374	
  1375	        If you look specifically for NCR's 53c8xx drivers, the german
  1376	        c't BBS at ++49-511-5352301 is worth a look. c't has a deal with
  1377	        NCR and major motherboard manufacturers like Asus, J-Bond and
  1378	        Gigabyte to have the latest drivers and Flash BIOS versions on
  1379	        their BBS for download. I don't know if it's allowed to upload
  1380	        these drivers to CIS or other BBS, but i didn't find an explicit
  1381	        "NO" in my log files.
  1382	
  1383	
  1384	5.1.1   CDROM drivers and software
  1385	
  1386	        There are different SCSI CDROM drivers. Some of these use a
  1387	        standard interface like ASPI or CAM as a base and some directly
  1388	        address the hardware. When looking for a CDROM driver, keep in
  1389	        mind that it not only must support your drive, but also your
  1390	        host adapter or your SCSI driver interface. So, for example,
  1391	        there are some flavours of Trantor's TSLCDR.SYS. Some of them
  1392	        work over ASPI, but most of these supplied with sound cards are
  1393	        dedicated to the sound board's hardware. The same happens with
  1394	        some other CDROM drivers.
  1395	
  1396	        The drivers I know personally are ASPICD.SYS from Adaptec,
  1397	        Trantor's TSLCDR.SYS (ASPI and hardware-specific types) and
  1398	        Toshiba's MDSCD_AS.SYS. All of these work with my Toshiba 3301
  1399	        and 3401 drives, just that MDSCD_AS.SYS locks up when a multi-
  1400	        session PhotoCD is in the drive on startup.
  1401	
  1402	        There are some packages out there to read digital audio data
  1403	        from the drive. CorelSCSI 2.0 includes two such programs for
  1404	        DOS and Windows. Also, there is Jim McLaughlin's CDDA 1.0 and
  1405	        CTCDREAD from c't, a german magazine. According to CDDA's doc,
  1406	        a few others exist on the internet - however, i know none of
  1407	        them. CDDA 1.0 works with various Apple, Chinon, NEC, Sony and
  1408	        Toshiba drives. Also, it has a MSCDEX-only mode that may work
  1409	        on other, also non-SCSI drives.
  1410	
  1411	5.1.2.  Scanner drivers and software
  1412	
  1413	        A lot of SCSI scanners that come with dedicated SCSI adapters
  1414	        also have "standard" drivers to attach the scanner to another
  1415	        SCSI host adapter and address it over ASPI or CAM interfaces.
  1416	        For the HP Scanjet IIxx series, this driver is called SJIIX.SYS.
  1417	        My own Epson GT-6500 works flawlessly over ASPI with EPSON.SYS.
  1418	        If you don't have a generic SCSI driver for your scanner, ask
  1419	        your dealer about it and/or look in the vendor's forum or the
  1420	        Graphic support (GRAPHSUP) forum on CompuServe. Also, there are
  1421	        some drivers in forum sections of OEMs like Vobis (This german
  1422	        stores have OEM models of some Microtek and Mustek scanners and
  1423	        so keep the drivers in their forum)
  1424	        If you don't find anything, Corel SCSI 2.0 is worth a look.
  1425	        The Corel guys support a lot of different scanners with their
  1426	        generic TWAIN-over-ASPI support.
  1427	
  1428	5.1.3.  Removeable and Magneto-optical devices.
  1429	
  1430	        There seem to be basically three types of removeable disks in
  1431	        the market: magneto-optical drives, Bernoulli and Syquest disks.
  1432	        I don't have access to a Syquest, but I use my Bernoulli and a
  1433	        MO drive with ASPIDISK.SYS under DOS. With OS/2, there is a
  1434	        driver for Magnetoopticals (OPTICAL.SYS), and the Bernoulli
  1435	        is supported as a very big floppy disk with the standard drivers.
  1436	        IOMega's OS/2 drivers work by bypassing OS/2's driver concept
  1437	        with IOMega's own (slow) SCSI adapters, so I never tested them.
  1438	        Generally, if possible, I try to use standard drivers, not the
  1439	        vendor-specific ones, for I get better compatibility with the
  1440	        "standard" ones.
  1441	
  1442	5.2.    some small SCSI tools
  1443	
  1444	        Over times, I collected various SCSI tools that came with host
  1445	        adapters or as a support aid from vendors. There are some useful
  1446	        utilities that might save you time. So, here a list of some of
  1447	        these niceties:
  1448	
  1449	        NCR's GANGCOPY.EXE copies complete SCSI disks that are attached
  1450	        to a NCR CAM-compliant host adapter. It can be very useful for
  1451	        dealers or support staff with big standard configurations - copy
  1452	        the master and then mount the copy into the new PC.
  1453	
  1454	        HP's SCSI driver pack for the Scanjet II scanners has a tool
  1455	        called FindSCSI.EXE. It scans for ASPI and CAM drivers, then
  1456	        displays the attached devices like this:
  1457	
  1458	           ADAPTEC AHA-1x4x is ASPI Host adapter 0.
  1459	                 QUANTUM PD425S       at Address 0, Stat 0.
  1460	                 DEC     DSP3085S-B   at Address 1, Stat 0.
  1461	                 TANDBERG TDC 3600    at Address 2, Stat 0.
  1462	                 TOSHIBA CD-ROM XM-33 at Address 3, Stat 0.
  1463	                 SDI     LaserStor    at Address 4, Stat 0.
  1464	           CAM manager is NOT present
  1465	
  1466	        Also, Conner supplies ASPIINFO.EXE with their SCSI backup
  1467	        software. It uses only ASPI, but displays more information.
  1468	        I think that I saw ASPIINFO originally on CIS, so it may be
  1469	        freely available.
  1470	
  1471	        Also, there is a tool called SHOWSCSI that started as a demo
  1472	        program for the c't ASPI library. It is basically a small clone
  1473	        of Adaptec's Windows-based SHOWSCSI program. Output is like:

  1499	
  1500	        Seagate has a tool called ASPIID, that shows lots of more-or-less
  1501	        useful information about SCSI disks. Also seen on CompuServe...
  1502	
  1503	5.3.    Tape software (only Shareware)
  1504	
  1505	        There are a few Shareware or Freeware TAR implementations out.
  1506	        The first I ever saw was Greg Shenaut's ASPITAPE.SYS and PCTAR
  1507	        combination. If I remember right, ASPITAPE.SYS is $20-Shareware
  1508	        and PCTAR is freeware. According to my test-experience, it works
  1509	        flawless, but the TAR is somewhat limited in its possibilities.
  1510	
  1511	        At the moment, I use GNU Tar for DOS and OS/2. I found GNU Tar
  1512	        for DOS on CompuServe in the IBMHW forum, GNU Tar for OS/2 in
  1513	        the OS2USER forum. Both work OK with my systems and any other i
  1514	        tested, and GNU Tar is IMHO the best TAR in the world.
  1515	        ASPITAPE/PCTAR should be in IBMHW also or in the UNIXFORUM.
  1516	
  1517	
  1518	5.4.    Programming info for SCSI
  1519	
  1520	        At the moment, I don't know how to obtain CAM programming info.
  1521	        However, NCR's SCSI BBS surely should be a good point to start
  1522	        searching.
  1523	
  1524	        ASPI information can be obtained from Adaptec BBS. There is a
  1525	        very good ASPI programming lib for ASM, C and Turbo Pascal from
  1526	        c't, a german magazine. I'll upload what I have to the German
  1527	        computer forum GERNET in the next days (section "c't"). I'm not
  1528	        sure if i'm allowed to upload it to IBMHW, so that must wait
  1529	        'til i'm sure.

  1531	6.      Some thoughts about SCSI devices (and other interfaces)
  1532	
  1533	
  1534	6.1.    Hard disk drives
  1535	
  1536	        SCSI was always a high-end interface for hard disks. For it was
  1537	        expensive, it naturally showed up only in high-end disks. At the
  1538	        moment, you'll see that all "state of the art" hard disks use
  1539	        SCSI and the generation before (in capacity/technology terms)
  1540	        gets equipped with IDE/ATAPI interfaces for the mass market.
  1541	        The point where this technology transfer comes in changes
  1542	        slightly - now there are 1GB+ ATAPI and EIDE hard disks, but the
  1543	        2GB+ range is still - i think - a SCSI domain.
  1544	
  1545	
  1546	6.1.1.  RAID drive arrays
  1547	
  1548	        RAID is a technology that's nearly "married" with SCSI. RAID
  1549	        is a method to combine two or more disk drives to a bigger
  1550	        logical drive with or without redundancy/fault tolerance.
  1551	        The acronym RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) tells
  1552	        the main reason why it came up - either combining cheap disks
  1553	        to sell a disk system for much more money than the disk drives'
  1554	        cost <g>, or combining drives to get a bigger drive that was
  1555	        possible with a single drive.
  1556	        Now, RAID is primarily a security option, for it's actual used
  1557	        types add redundancy to the disk system to be able to swap a
  1558	        defective disk without using data.
  1559	
  1560	        RAID exists in several levels ordered by numbers;
  1561	
  1562	        RAID 0, called "striping", combines two or more disks to a big
  1563	        logical disk drive. The data is distributed between the disks
  1564	        by a "striping factor", that means, data are separated by blocks
  1565	        of, let's say 32 kByte, between the disks. This could, not
  1566	        neccessarily must, give also better performance with big files,
  1567	        for data come from parallel drives.
  1568	        Raid 0 gives no security plus.
  1569	
  1570	        Sometimes you'll see "disk spanning" advertised as a RAID 0
  1571	        feature. Spanning isn't RAID, though, as it is just combining
  1572	        two or more disks to a bigger logical one by adding up the
  1573	        sector numbers without striping. Spanning was mostly used in the
  1574	        past, when single disks didn't get over 1GB.
  1575	        Spanning was easy implementable in driver software. SpeedStor's
  1576	        abilities, for example, also include disk spanning.
  1577	
  1578	        RAID 1, also called "disk mirroring", adds no capacity, but
  1579	        enhances security by reading/writing the same data from/to two
  1580	        disks. With an intelligent two-channel controller, this can
  1581	        sometimes lead to a small performance plus on read operations,
  1582	        for - if all disks can read and write simultaneously - the first
  1583	        disk completing the read process sets the "time mark". Write
  1584	        operations normally become slower, as the write must be done on
  1585	        all drives before it's completed.
  1586	        In real world, it's normally a speed brake, at least its software
  1587	        variants.
  1588	
  1589	        RAID 2 uses a dedicated drive for error-correcting information.
  1590	        The high redundancy of RAID 1 (2 GB disks for 1 GB data) was
  1591	        reduced by using Hamming-codes for the correction data to about
  1592	        40%. RAID 2 needs ECC error correction built-in in all disks.
  1593	        In the RAID 2 model, striping is implemented at bit-level, that
  1594	        means, bit 0 goes to disk 0, bit 1 to disk 1 and so on...
  1595	        However, i never saw or got info about a RAID 2 system, for they
  1596	        would be very expensive to implement.
  1597	
  1598	        RAID 3 and 4 consists of at least 2 data drives and a dedicated
  1599	        ECC data drive. Data is striped between the disks, typically in
  1600	        byte-packets and XOR combined for the ECC drive. Typically, the
  1601	        performance is good with large file reads, worse with small file
  1602	        accesses or many writes on a network server.
  1603	        RAID 4 used very high striping factors, thus giving better
  1604	        performance than level 3, but still somewhat slow, for the ECC
  1605	        drive still has to be used on _every_ disk write access.
  1606	
  1607	        RAID 5 distributes the ECC data between all drives, so the
  1608	        bottleneck of level 3 and 4, the dedicated ECC drive, vanishes.
  1609	        So, disk accesses can overlap, thus giving better performance.
  1610	
  1611	        RAID level 7 i saw only once in a high-end workstation cluster.
  1612	        Level 7 systems normally have a big (200-500 MB) cache and lots
  1613	        of disk channels or even workstations. ECC data are calculated
  1614	        and maintained in the cache; mainly for this reason, performance
  1615	        is very good and can be scaled up by adding cache RAM and/or
  1616	        disk channels.
  1617	
  1618	
  1619	6.2.    Removeable disk and Magneto-Optical drives
  1620	
  1621	        All removeable devices i used myself started as and still are
  1622	        SCSI devices. The only other devices i know are Syquest's Puma
  1623	        ATAPI drive and an older Sony MO with an ESDI interface and a
  1624	        special interface card.
  1625	
  1626	
  1627	6.3.    CDROM drives
  1628	
  1629	        SCSI CDROMs mostly share the CDROM Common Command Set. This
  1630	        means, all these CDROM drives work with a standard driver, at
  1631	        least in their data mode. However, the audio commands are not
  1632	        standardized, so you might encounter driver problems here, when
  1633	        installing a brand-new drive with older drivers. All drivers
  1634	        i know default to data-mode only in this case.
  1635	        Older NEC drives can be a bit difficult here, especially the
  1636	        portable CDR-35 and CDR-36 models. Their SCSI implementation
  1637	        is described best as "bold" - simply "bad" isn't enough here.
  1638	        I got my old CDR-35 working _only_ with a Trantor MiniSCSI
  1639	        parallel adapter and only, if it was the _only_ device on the
  1640	        bus, but not with various Adaptecs and also not with the FD
  1641	        adapters i could test with.
  1642	        The CDR-73/74/83/84 drives mostly work, if "SCSI parity" and
  1643	        "Synchronous Negotiation" are disabled for these IDs or the
  1644	        whole bus.
  1645	
  1646	
  1647	6.4.    Jukeboxes and other media changer devices
  1648	
  1649	        Jukeboxes for all types of media (CDROMs, WORMs, MOs, DAT
  1650	        cartridges) are generally available as SCSI devices only, as
  1651	        SCSI is the only standardized interface that supports them
  1652	        in PC architectures. Either each medium gets a dedicated ID
  1653	        that can be addressed by the PC or the different media are
  1654	        combined to a single structure.
  1655	        Of course, the various Mainframe interfaces are also supported
  1656	        by devices like WORM changers - these devices originally came
  1657	        from this "Jurassic park" world into the lower-end system worlds
  1658	        like workstations and PCs.
  1659	
  1660	
  1661	6.5.    Tape drives
  1662	
  1663	        Professional tape drives started with the QIC-36 and QIC-02
  1664	        interfaces, then fast tended towards SCSI. For the lower-end
  1665	        market, the QIC consortium defined QIC-107 and -117, the
  1666	        floppy-disk based interfaces for the QIC-40 and QIC-80 mini-
  1667	        cartridge tape drives. QIC-117 strongly depends on the PC's
  1668	        floppy disk controller's timing and signaling and therefore
  1669	        isn't very portable to other architectures.
  1670	        High-end tapes like QIC with 500MB+, 4mm and 8mm DAT, DLT and
  1671	        so on generally aren't available other than SCSI and maybe a
  1672	        few specific interfaces from the mini and mainframe world.
  1673	
  1674	
  1675	6.6.    Scanners
  1676	
  1677	        Scanners exist with a lot of interfaces. In the past, serial,
  1678	        parallel and IEC interfaces were common besides SCSI. The higher
  1679	        resolution and color depth fast decided this interface struggle
  1680	        towards SCSI. Generally, professional scanners use SCSI now, but
  1681	        keep this history in mind when looking at some older, but maybe
  1682	        very good scanner. The SCSI models mostly work with standard
  1683	        host adapters, if you find a driver for them. Canon, for
  1684	        example, switched to ASPI support only a few months ago.
  1685	
  1686	        SCSI scanners are often somewhat "incorrect" in identifying
  1687	        themselves to the system. My EPSON GT-6500 for example, tells
  1688	        me "EPSON SC" as vendor info, and "ANNER GT-6500" as model,
  1689	        besides the SCSI-0 id it gives to the host adapter. 
  1690	        This comes, for most Scanner manufacturers have their own
  1691	        pre-SCSI-II command set that they rely on. There was never a
  1692	        standardizing neccessity as with hard disks, where devices not
  1693	        compatible with the SCSI CCS would have been impossible to sell.
  1694	        So, SCSI is still sort of a mess with most scanner vendors.
  1695	
  1696	Appendix A.     SCSI Connectors
  1697	
  1698	
  1699	A.1.    25 pin DB-25 SCSI connector
  1700	
  1701	        The DB-25 connector is the one looking like a PC's printer port.
  1702	        I think Apple introduced this DB-25 connector for SCSI, but I'm
  1703	        not sure about it. The Macintosh Plus didn't supply Termination
  1704	        power, so pin 25 isn't connected with this model.
  1705	        Future Domain had a different DB-25 connector on their first
  1706	        adapters and adopted the Apple pinout scheme on their TMCxxxM
  1707	        SCSI host adapters later. Also, the M-models have a label
  1708	        "Apple pinout" somewhere on the slot plate.
  1709	        The adapters in question are the TMC-820, -830, -840, -845,
  1710	        -850, -860, -870, -875, -885 and MCS-350. If you need a cable
  1711	        for one of these, contact Future Domain for the cable with part
  1712	        number HCA-108.
  1713	        Extreme care should be taken if you get a Future Domain Cable
  1714	        or an adapter where you're not _absolutely_ sure if it's an old
  1715	        FD or an Apple-style device. Wrong connections will blow your TP
  1716	        fuse on the host adapter and - probably - destroy the host
  1717	        adapter or other devices on the SCSI bus !
  1718	
  1719	        The pin counting is like:     1  2  3  4 ... 13
  1720	                                       14 15 16 ... 25

  1826	        There is a DB-50 connector (three-row) variant in SCSI-1 that
  1827	        Sun Microsystems used for older peripherals, but it's normally
  1828	        not used any more. However, if you need the layout, holler, and
  1829	        I'll search for it.

  2025	Appendix B.     Some places to get information about SCSI
  2026	                Support BBS numbers
  2027	
  2028	        There are some documents over and about SCSI. Of course, the
  2029	        first source of information are the spec documents. However,
  2030	        they are hard to read and hard to understand if it's your first
  2031	        jump into SCSI.
  2032	        There is a very good article about "What's new in SCSI-2" in
  2033	        the January 1991 issue of "Computer Technology Review". It is
  2034	        written by Dal Allan from ENDL, one of the real "SCSI gurus".
  2035	        Also, there are some books about SCSI (i have none of these,
  2036	        so I can't comment on them).
  2037	
  2038	        Also, there are some places where SCSI information is present
  2039	        in electronic form.
  2040	
  2041	        In first place, the NCR SCSI BBS, where the official documents
  2042	        are available.
  2043	        The NCR SCSI BBS        : 001-719-574-0424
  2044	
  2045	        NCR also has a support BBS for their systems, where drivers are
  2046	        available for download:
  2047	        The NCR Drivers BBS     : 001-803-843-1811
  2048	
  2049	        Also, there are some SCSI vendors that offer BBS support.
  2050	        They may or may not have some SCSI-related information.
  2051	        For example, the Adaptec BBS has all the ASPI documents.
  2052	        Some of these BBSs I list here. The BBSs with a * are
  2053	        BBSs I called recently, so I assume the phone number is ok.

  2077	Appendix C.     Termination Diagrams
  2078	
  2079	
  2080	        Here are some termination diagrams about various configurations
  2081	        and their neccessary termination.
  2082	
  2083	        Your host adapter may have a software-possibility to enable or
  2084	        disable termination. In this case, of course, you don't need to
  2085	        remove the resistor packs to disable termination.
  2086	        Also, with external device termination, you could also terminate
  2087	        the last external device internal, but that would limit your
  2088	        flexibility with them, so i suggest having all external devices
  2089	        not terminated and attaching an external active terminator to the
  2090	        last device's second connector.
  2091

  2138	Appendix D.     SCSI and QIC - any relations ?
  2139	
  2140	
  2141	        Principally, the terms SCSI and QIC have (nearly) nothing to
  2142	        do with each other. However, there are some contact points.
  2143	        QIC stands for "Quarter Inch Committee" and originally meant a
  2144	        non-profit organization that was formed from tape drive and
  2145	        tape cartridge vendors to get exchange standards for tapes.
  2146	
  2147	        The QIC committee and its members since then develop, approve
  2148	        and promote the various QIC standards. The numbers are somewhat
  2149	        chaotic - they somewhat seem to come out "by the numbers".
  2150	        QIC defines tape drive interfaces like SCSI, Floppy-controller
  2151	        interfaces, QIC-02/36 and tape formats like QIC-40, 80, 150 ...
  2152	        Let's try some cleaning up...
  2153	
  2154	        Tape drive interface standards:
  2155	
  2156	        QIC-02        : a somewhat "intelligent" hardware interface,
  2157	        QIC-36        : basic hardware interface, simpler than QIC-02
  2158	        QIC-104/11    : mainly describes SCSI-1 as tape interface
  2159	        QIC-107       : Commands and timing for QIC-80 drives
  2160	        QIC-117       : the "floppy tape" interface for QIC-80 streamers
  2161	        QIC-121       : like QIC 104, but based on SCSI-2
  2162	
  2163	        A lot of the older QIC-02 interfaces are basically QIC-36 drives
  2164	        with an additional QIC-02 bridge controller. Some of these bridge
  2165	        controllers can be replaced with SCSI bridge controllers like the
  2166	        Emulex MT-02 or Adaptec ACB-3530.
  2167	
  2168	        QIC tape formats:
  2169	
  2170	        QIC-ID       Tape        Storage     Tracks      Length
  2171	                                 (MB)                    (FT.)
  2172	          11         300XLP        45          4           450
  2173	          24         DC600A        60          9           600
  2174	          40         DC2000        40         20           205
  2175	                     DC2060        60         20           307.5
  2176	          80         DC2080        80         32           205
  2177	                     DC2120       120         32           307.5
  2178	         120         DC600A       125         15           600
  2179	         150         DC6150       150         18           600
  2180	                     DC6250       250         18          1020
  2181	         525         DC6320       320         24           600
  2182	                     DC6525       525         24          1000
  2183	        1000    Magnus 9100      1000         32            ?
  2184	        1350           9135      1350         36            ?
  2185	
  2186	        Most formats offer eXtended Length (XL) tapes that give higher
  2187	        capacity, for example the 250MB DC6250 tapes for QIC-150 drives.
  2188	        Also, there is a nuisance in the industry to call the QIC-80
  2189	        tapes with XL tapes (120MB) "250 MB" tapes. This works only
  2190	        with the compression built into the backup _software_.
  2191	        Keep this in mind if you compare tape drives with different
  2192	        technologies. The only company I know that uses a similar
  2193	        approach is Colorado with their PowerTape drives. They can
  2194	        compared by basically halving their capacity and look for the
  2195	        nearest capacity standard.
  2196	
  2197	        QIC has become a company (Quarter Inch Compatibility, Inc), that
  2198	        still defines and certifies tape standards. Now, the members are
  2199	        3M, Sony, Gigatek, HP, Conner, Colorado Memory Systems, IOMega,
  2200	        Wangtek and Tandberg.
  2201	        However, since they are a company, the "introduction rate" of
  2202	        new, mostly mini-cartridge-based tape formats and standards
  2203	        was inflationary. Lots of new formats came up, some of these new
  2204	        tape drives can even read QIC-80 tapes, but most are not upward
  2205	        compatible. Of course, these standards are incompatible with each
  2206	        other, so that you can be sure that half of these standards will
  2207	        become obsolete in their first years - seems that the lession is
  2208	        "If it's business - forget the standards".
  2209	        But we'll see - it's our responsibility to buy what we feel
  2210	        should survive, not the other systems.
  2211	
  2212	        Some of the new Mini-standards are:
  2213	
  2214	        name/format   cartridge     capacity   can read
  2215	                      type
