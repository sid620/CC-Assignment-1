     4	Is the cosmos younger than the stars it contains? Was Einstein's
     5	biggest blunder not a mistake? Here's why cosmology is in chaos

     7	Time Magazine  (Mar 6)
     8	
     9	 Tod Lauer is starting to feel more than a little fed up with his
    10	fellow astronomers. Not long ago, Lauer and his close friend and
    11	collaborator Marc Postman, of the Space Telescope Science Institute,
    12	in Baltimore, Maryland, announced the results of a telescopic study
    13	they had been working on for more than a year. The young scientists
    14	reached the astonishing conclusion that rather than expanding outward
    15	in a stately fashion like the rest of the universe, a collection of
    16	many thousands of galaxies, including our own and spanning a billion
    17	light-years or so, may be speeding en masse toward a point somewhere
    18	in the direction of the constellation Virgo.
    19	
    20	Yet rather than try to assimilate this new finding, most of their
    21	colleagues are proclaiming that it must be a mistake. No one can
    22	explain what Lauer and Postman might have done wrong, despite
    23	strenuous efforts to do so. The analysis is incorrect, they say,
    24	simply because it doesn't fit in with any existing theory of how the
    25	cosmos works. ''Listen,'' fumes Lauer, who is stationed at the
    26	National Optical Astronomy Observatories in Tucson, Arizona, ''we knew
    27	this was a shocking result. That's why we spent over a year trying to
    28	debunk it ourselves before we went public. If anyone can present a
    29	good argument why it's wrong, we'll listen.''
    30	
    31	Allan Sandage is angry at his astronomical brethren too, but his beef
    32	is just the opposite of Lauer's. The Carnegie Observatories astronomer
    33	has spent much of his nearly 40-year career trying to measure the age
    34	of the universe; it's a task he inherited from his mentor Edwin
    35	Hubble, the legendary scientist who discovered that the universe is
    36	expanding and that galaxies exist beyond the Milky Way. For decades,
    37	Sandage's results have suggested that the cosmos is 15 billion to 20
    38	billion years old or thereabouts. That fits beautifully with
    39	cosmological theories -- but almost nobody believes him anymore.
    40	Instead they're listening to a young whippersnapper named Wendy
    41	Freedman, who happens to work just down the hall from Sandage at the
    42	Carnegie's center in Pasadena, California. Freedman and a group of
    43	colleagues have lately used the Hubble Space Telescope to peg the age
    44	at somewhere between 8 billion and 12 billion years -- which would
    45	make the cosmos 2 billion years younger than some of the stars it
    46	contains. ''Our opponents,'' says Sandage bitterly, ''are so
    47	wonderfully kind. They say we don't have anything to stand on.''
    48	
    49	Tension between theory and observation is part of the normal course of
    50	science. It keeps both sides honest, and, at those rare times in
    51	history when the two lock horns irreconcilably, it can lead to nothing
    52	less than a full-fledged scientific revolution. Without such clashes,
    53	in fact, we'd still believe that the sun orbits Earth and that disease
    54	is caused by evil spirits.
    55	
    56	
    57	But what's happening these days in cosmology -- the study of the
    58	universe -- verges on the bizarre. Astronomers have come up with one
    59	theory-busting discovery after another, hinting that a scientific
    60	revolution may be close at hand. At stake are answers to some of the
    61	most fundamental questions facing humanity: What is the origin of the
    62	universe? What is it made of? And what is its ultimate destiny?
    63	
    64	Nobody can say what the turmoil means -- whether the intellectual
    65	edifice of modern cosmology is tottering on the edge of collapse or
    66	merely feeling growing pains as it works out a few kinks. ''If you ask
    67	me,'' says astrophysicist Michael Turner of the Fermi National
    68	Accelerator Laboratory, near Chicago, ''either we're close to a
    69	breakthrough, or we're at our wits' end.''
    70	
    71	WEIRD DATA, WEIRD THEORIES: The bewildering discoveries by Lauer,
    72	Postman, Freedman and company are only the latest in a barrage of
    73	bafflements that stargazers have had to absorb lately. Over the past
    74	few years, astronomers have uncovered the existence of the Great Wall,
    75	a huge conglomeration of galaxies stretching across 500 million
    76	light-years of space; the Great Attractor, a mysterious concentration
    77	of mass hauling much of the local universe off in the direction of the
    78	constellations Hydra and Centaurus; Great Voids, where few galaxies
    79	can be found; and galaxies caught in the throes of formation a mere
    80	billion years after the Big Bang, when they should not yet exist. ''If
    81	we really trust the data,'' exclaims Stanford astrophysicist Andrei
    82	Linde, ''then we are in disaster, and we must do something absolutely
    83	crazy.''
    84	
    85	That's a big ''if.'' Observes David Schramm, a theoretical
    86	astrophysicist at the University of Chicago: ''Whenever you're at the
    87	forefront of science, one-third of the observational results always
    88	turn out to be wrong.'' But this hasn't stopped the theorists from
    89	doing crazy things anyway; they've proposed one mind-stretching idea
    90	after another to explain what's going on.
    91	
    92	One of these was inflation theory, which says the universe expanded
    93	like a balloon on amphetamines before the cosmos was one second old.
    94	Then there was cold dark matter, hypothetical subatomic particles that
    95	may account for 99% of the mass of the universe and may relegate
    96	ordinary atoms -- and the stars, planets and people they make up -- to
    97	the status of a cosmic afterthought. Another notion described
    98	distortions in the very fabric of space and time, going by the name
    99	cosmic strings and cosmic textures. And lately theorists have revived
   100	an old idea known as hot dark matter, and an even older one called the
   101	cosmological constant. The latter is a kind of cosmic antigravity that
   102	gives the expanding universe an extra outward push; it was first
   103	conceived by Albert Einstein himself, who then rejected it as ''the
   104	greatest blunder of my life.'' Each of these ideas is still floating
   105	around, championed by its own corps of diehards.
   106	
   107	In fairness, it must be acknowledged that cosmologists have had very
   108	little information to go on, at least until very recently. The distant
   109	galaxies that bear witness to the universe's origin, evolution and
   110	structure are excruciatingly faint, and it takes every bit of skill
   111	observers have to tease out their secrets. It hasn't been until the
   112	past decade, in fact, that astronomers have had powerful telescopes
   113	like the Hubble out in space and the Keck atop Hawaii's Mauna Kea,
   114	ultrafast supercomputers and super-sensitive electronic light
   115	detectors to give them the data they hunger for. In a very real sense,
   116	cosmology has only lately crossed the dividing line from theology into
   117	true science.
   118	
   119	Cosmologists can now say with some confidence that the universe
   120	started out in a very hot and very dense state somewhere between 8
   121	billion and 25 billion years ago, and that it has been expanding
   122	outward ever since -- the Big Bang in a nutshell. They believe
   123	galaxies are strewn around the cosmos not randomly but according to a
   124	pattern that includes some patches with lots of galaxies and others
   125	with very few. They believe the universe is pervaded by mysterious
   126	dark matter, whose gravity has dominated cosmic history from the
   127	start.
   128	
   129	But beyond that, things get murky. The experts don't know for sure how
   130	old or how big the universe is. They don't know what most of it is
   131	made of. They don't know in any detail how it began or how it will
   132	end. And, beyond the local cosmic neighborhood, they don't know much
   133	about what it looks like. Each of these questions is now under study;
   134	each bears directly on the others; and each could yield within the
   135	next few years to the intellectual and instrumental firepower now
   136	being brought to bear on it. Assuming, that is, that the universe
   137	cooperates.
   138	
   139	THE AGE CRISIS: ''You can't be older than your ma,'' quips Christopher
   140	Impey of the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory. Sounds
   141	obvious, maybe, but if Freedman and her colleagues are right about
   142	their space-telescope observations, it would seem that the universe
   143	hasn't caught on to this bit of common sense. The most straightforward
   144	interpretation of their data implies that the cosmos is 12 billion
   145	years old, max. But experts insist that the oldest stars in the Milky
   146	Way have been around for at least 14 billion years. ''They could quite
   147	easily be several billion years older than that,'' says Yale's Pierre
   148	Demarque.
   149	
   150	Demarque and his fellow stellar astronomers make a good case. The life
   151	and death of stars is something the scientists think they understand
   152	pretty well. They know about the nuclear reactions that power
   153	starshine; they know about what chemical elements the stars contain,
   154	and in what proportions; and they have created detailed, accurate
   155	computer simulations of stellar life cycles. When they say 14 billion
   156	years, it probably pays to listen.
   157	
   158	But it also pays to listen to Freedman. She's a highly respected
   159	observational astronomer, and so are the 13 others on her
   160	space-telescope team. Moreover, theirs is only the latest in a series
   161	of measurements that point to a relatively young universe. Just a
   162	month before these results appeared in the journal Nature, two other
   163	sets of astronomers came out with their own young-universe
   164	observations. And while a handful of studies have emerged over the
   165	past few years arguing instead for an older cosmos, many more have
   166	converged on a younger age. The Freedman team's observations are
   167	considered by far the most definitive because they are based on the
   168	Hubble's extraordinarily clear vision. Moreover, the concept that
   169	underlies their calculations is utterly straightforward. Astronomers
   170	have known since Hubble's heyday in the 1920s that you need only two
   171	pieces of information to deduce the age of the universe: how fast the
   172	galaxies are flying apart and how far away they are. The ratio of
   173	these two numbers tells you how fast the cosmos is expanding (a rate
   174	known as the Hubble Constant; it's expressed, for those who insist on
   175	the proper terminology, in units of kilometers per second of
   176	recessional speed per megaparsec of distance). A simple calculation
   177	then tells you how long it's been since the expansion started. ''There
   178	are these two loopholes, though,'' notes University of Oklahoma
   179	astrophysicist David Branch. ''What's the right distance, and what's
   180	the right speed?''
   181	
   182	These loopholes are big enough to drive the Starship Enterprise
   183	through. It's terrifically hard to measure how far away galaxies are.
   184	If they came in a standard brightness, like 100-W light bulbs, the
   185	astronomers could just figure that a dimmer galaxy was more distant
   186	than a bright one. Unfortunately, they don't. Edwin Hubble himself
   187	didn't realize this and triggered an earlier ''age crisis'' in the
   188	1940s when he announced that the universe was 2 billion years old.
   189	Geologists already knew that Earth was older than that.
   190	
   191	Astronomy's most reliable light bulb, or, to use the preferred and
   192	quainter term, standard candle, is a type of star called a Cepheid
   193	variable, whose inherent brightness can be easily calculated. But
   194	Cepheids can't be spotted more than a few galaxies away. And these
   195	nearby galaxies are virtually useless in filling in the other half of
   196	the equation -- the expansion rate. Reason: in a universe that's
   197	expanding overall, neighboring galaxies are flying apart much more
   198	slowly than distantly spaced ones. Nearby galaxies are also subject to
   199	their neighbors' gravity. The Andromeda galaxy, for example, is being
   200	pulled closer to the Milky Way, despite the overall cosmic expansion.
   201	
   202	Since accurate distances can be measured only nearby, while useful
   203	galaxies are found only deep in space, astronomers do the best they
   204	can to bridge the gap. They use the close galaxies to estimate
   205	distances to the faraway ones. But the method is inexact, which is why
   206	they haven't been able to agree on what the age actually is.
   207	
   208	It's also why the Hubble Space Telescope was explicitly designed, at
   209	least in part, to find Cepheid-variable stars at greater distances
   210	than ground-based telescopes could. nasa and its scientific advisers
   211	figured that the deeper they could go into the universe before they
   212	had to switch from more to less accurate ways of gauging distance, the
   213	better. The Hubble's misshapen mirror delayed things for a while, but
   214	shortly after the spectacularly successful repair mission in December
   215	1993, Freedman and her team focused the space telescope on a faraway
   216	galaxy called M100. ''We could see right away that we'd be able to
   217	find Cepheids,'' she recalls.
   218	
   219	The observations were moved to the head of the Hubble schedule, and by
   220	July, Freedman was looking at a pattern on her computer screen that
   221	was as familiar as the face of an old friend. ''Boom!'' she remembers.
   222	''All of a sudden there was this glorious Cepheid light curve, as
   223	beautiful as any that have ever been measured.'' By the end of the
   224	observing run, Freedman and her colleagues found 19 more, enough to
   225	peg M100's distance at some 56 million light-years from Earth.
   226	
   227	That still isn't far enough out to give a direct measure of the Hubble
   228	-- the cosmic rate of expansion. But M100 is part of a huge group of
   229	galaxies known as the Virgo cluster. The M100 calculation gave the
   230	astronomers the distance to Virgo, and they used that number in turn
   231	to estimate the distance to the Coma cluster of galaxies, about five
   232	times as far away. Coma, finally, is far enough out that it's a
   233	reliable indicator of the Hubble Constant. Based on Freedman's
   234	analysis, the Constant comes in at 80, indicating a universe between 8
   235	billion and 12 billion years old.
   236	
   237	While most astronomers take these numbers very seriously -- along with
   238	the cosmic paradox they imply -- Allan Sandage, Freedman's grumpy
   239	colleague down the hall, is having none of it. He doesn't quibble with
   240	her measurement of the distance to M100, but insists that the analysis
   241	breaks down after that. Like most astronomers, Sandage has his
   242	favorite method of gauging the relative distance of galaxies. He finds
   243	a type of supernova -- an exploding star -- and compares supernova
   244	brightnesses from one galaxy to another. He claims, as he has done for
   245	more than 20 years, that the Hubble Constant is lower, which means the
   246	age of the universe goes up considerably. Says Oklahoma's David
   247	Branch, his close collaborator: ''We're very happy to be in this
   248	controversy because we think we're right.''
   249	
   250	But most astronomers don't -- partly because just about everyone else
   251	gets different results, partly because they suspect Sandage is guilty
   252	of a cardinal sin of science: having a preferred answer in mind before
   253	making observations.
   254	
   255	Freedman is the first to admit her team's age figures could be off 20%
   256	in either direction. The reason: no one knows whether M100 lies inside
   257	the Virgo cluster or whether it is more in the foreground or
   258	background. Astronomers have to check out other galaxies in the area
   259	before they are sure that M100 fairly measures the distance of the
   260	cluster as a whole. They're also checking galaxies outside Virgo, and
   261	while Freedman won't say what they have found so far, she told Time
   262	that the results are ''consistent'' with the preliminary figures.
   263	
   264	If she's right and Sandage is wrong, as many cosmic handicappers are
   265	betting, then the age crisis won't go away without some fundamental
   266	change in the way astronomers understand the cosmos. That means at
   267	least some scientists will have to give up their cherished beliefs
   268	about how stars work or how the universe is organized or what it's
   269	made of -- or maybe even all of the above.
   270	
   271	
   272	THE DARK-MATTER PROBLEM: High on the list of concepts that
   273	astronomical theorists would hate to lose is cosmic inflation. It
   274	sounds nutty, but the universe actually makes a lot more sense if you
   275	assume that just after it was born all of space went into overdrive,
   276	exploding outward for the briefest fraction of a second. Inflation
   277	explains, among other things, such mysteries as why the universe looks
   278	pretty much the same in all directions and how a peanut-butter-smooth
   279	distribution of matter in the young cosmos evolved into today's lumpy
   280	distribution, with clusters of galaxies surrounded by empty space.
   281	
   282	Inflation theory doesn't just explain things; it makes predictions.
   283	Chief among them: the blackness of space is only seemingly empty. In
   284	fact, it probably abounds with vast amounts of matter -- matter that
   285	cannot be directly detected because it doesn't shine. If this theory
   286	is correct, then there must be precisely enough of this dark matter so
   287	that gravity will forever slow the expansion of the universe without
   288	ever quite stopping it, balancing space on a gravitational knife edge
   289	between eternal growth and eventual collapse.
   290	
   291	Dark matter is more than merely theoretical. The first hint that the
   292	cosmos contains more than meets the eye came back in the 1930s, when
   293	Caltech astronomer Fritz Zwicky pointed his telescope at the Coma
   294	cluster of galaxies and realized that it shouldn't exist. Individual
   295	galaxies in the cluster were orbiting each other so fast that they
   296	should long since have flown out into deep space -- unless gravity
   297	from some unseen matter was keeping them together. Nobody took Zwicky
   298	too seriously; the idea was crazy, first of all, and besides, the
   299	measurements of orbital speeds were difficult to make and prone to
   300	error. Nor did anybody take Vera Rubin seriously when in 1970 she and
   301	a colleague at the Carnegie Institution of Washington discovered that
   302	some galaxies were rotating too fast on their own axes -- again,
   303	evidence of extra gravity from unseen matter.
   304	
   305	Not until a little more than a decade ago was dark matter finally
   306	accepted as a huge problem rather than a nagging anomaly. Observation
   307	after observation showed that galaxies moved as if they were embedded
   308	in clouds of invisible matter containing 10 times as much mass as was
   309	accounted for by visible gas and stars. Clusters of galaxies behaved
   310	as if there was 30 times as much dark matter as visible matter
   311	exerting its gravitational pull. To satisfy inflation theory, the
   312	ratio would have to be even greater: 100 times as much dark matter as
   313	visible.
   314	
   315	Leaving aside theory, the challenge of identifying and understanding
   316	the stuff that makes up most of the universe has become one of the
   317	most irresistible -- and frustrating -- quests in science. For more
   318	than a decade, the campaign has proceeded on two fronts: attempts to
   319	directly observe the missing matter, and attempts to identify it via
   320	computer simulations. Those who do the latter assume that dark matter
   321	is made of a given particle or substance, then create a computer model
   322	of the cosmos based on that assumption, let it evolve in cyberspace,
   323	and see if the result looks like the real universe.
   324	
   325	An early theory was that the missing matter is composed of commonplace
   326	particles called neutrinos. One problem with this is that dark matter
   327	is massive, and no one knows if neutrinos have mass. Even if they
   328	have, in computer simulations they do a poor job of making a
   329	recognizable universe. Cold dark matter was another possibility
   330	(''cold,'' in physics jargon, means slow-moving; neutrinos, by
   331	contrast, are ''hot''). Also known as wimps, for weakly interacting
   332	massive particles, these are purely hypothetical particles derived
   333	from speculative theories. They perform somewhat better in computer
   334	models, but wimps can't account for such newly discovered features of
   335	the cosmos as Great Walls, Great Voids and Great Attractors.
   336	
   337	Physicists hoping to observe dark matter directly have searched for
   338	objects both large and subatomic. On the theory that the dark stuff is
   339	made of some as yet undiscovered particle, they have built all manner
   340	of sensitive detectors. On the chance that it is composed of very dim
   341	stars or large planet-like objects (known collectively as machos, or
   342	massive compact halo objects), they have studied stars for telltale
   343	flickers that might indicate a macho has passed by.
   344	
   345	Physicists and astronomers have looked for all of the above and more,
   346	but results have been inconclusive. wimp searches are barely getting
   347	under way; macho hunts have turned up disappointingly few flickers at
   348	the outer edges of the Milky Way (but surprisingly many toward the
   349	galaxy's core). The latest teaser came last month when news leaked out
   350	that researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory had seen evidence
   351	for what could be a slightly massive neutrino.
   352	
   353	If it's true, the finding is of literally cosmic significance: there
   354	are so many neutrinos in the universe that they alone could account
   355	for some 20% of the dark matter that inflation theory requires. Just
   356	add in another 80% worth of wimps and you've got it, says Joel Primack
   357	of the University of California, Santa Cruz. With this recipe, Primack
   358	has used supercomputers to produce synthetic universes that look
   359	almost identical to the data gathered by real-life astronomical
   360	observers. But some theorists think Primack is grasping too quickly at
   361	a ''discovery'' that is still controversial.
   362	
   363	Neutrinos with mass might help solve the dark-matter problem and thus
   364	provide support for the inflation theory. But in some ways that would
   365	just make the crisis in cosmology worse. The more dark matter there is
   366	in the universe, the harder it is to explain the new findings made by
   367	Freedman's group about the age of the cosmos. When they say the
   368	universe is between 8 billion and 12 billion years old, their
   369	vagueness reflects uncertainty about how much matter the cosmos
   370	contains. If there's a lot, as inflation suggests, its gravity would
   371	be slowing down the universe's expansion, making the universe younger
   372	than it looks. If, on the other hand, there is relatively little
   373	matter, the slowing has been minimal, and 12 billion is more like it.
   374	
   375	If inflation is correct, then, the age crisis is as bad as it can
   376	possibly be. No amount of theory adjustment can bring stars down to 8
   377	billion years of age. So if Freedman's initial attempt to date the
   378	universe holds up, Primack and plenty of other theorists may have to
   379	begin prying themselves away from an idea they have held dear for more
   380	than a decade -- unless they can think of some clever way out.
   381	
   382	EINSTEIN'S BIGGEST BLUNDER: Even at an optimum age of 12 billion
   383	years, the universe is too young to accommodate 14 billion-year-old
   384	stars, so even the radical step of abandoning the inflation theory
   385	might not be enough to resolve the age crisis. But there could be a
   386	solution that allows inflation to remain. All the theorists have to do
   387	is throw out another of their cherished beliefs: that Einstein was
   388	right when he repudiated his concept of a cosmological constant. Says
   389	Princeton physicist Jim Peebles: ''People hate the cosmological
   390	constant. I used to hate it too. But it's something we might grow to
   391	love.''
   392	
   393	They might have to. The constant can be thought of as a kind of
   394	universe-wide repulsive force, a sort of antigravity. Einstein thought
   395	that he needed it in his general relativity theory to balance the
   396	pernicious influence of gravity. Without a cosmological constant, said
   397	the equations, the universe would have to be either contracting or
   398	expanding -- which it didn't seem to be. It was only when Edwin Hubble
   399	discovered, a decade later, that it was indeed expanding that Einstein
   400	dropped the constant like a hot potato.
   401	
   402	But particle physicists later found that a cosmological constant arose
   403	naturally from their own theories. And now cosmologists may need it to
   404	get out of the age crisis. If the constant has the right value, then
   405	cosmologists can keep inflation. The cosmos would have started out in
   406	a long period described by scientists as ''loitering'' or
   407	''coasting,'' providing stars and galaxies with ample time to form.
   408	''Then,'' says Sandra Faber, Primack's Santa Cruz colleague,
   409	''suddenly the cosmological constant would kick in, gunning the
   410	expansion, making it faster.'' Measuring a large Hubble Constant and
   411	an apparently low age today, in other words, wouldn't be a reliable
   412	indicator of what was going on earlier in the universe's lifetime.
   413	Theorists might hate Einstein's abandoned child, but, says John
   414	Huchra, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
   415	Astrophysics, ''to an experimentalist it seems no more ad hoc than
   416	inflation.''
   417	
   418	THE STRUCTURE PROBLEM: At least there are some models of the cosmos --
   419	unpopular though they may be -- that accommodate Freedman's age
   420	estimates. The same cannot be said for Lauer and Postman's detection
   421	of large-scale motions across the universe. Most scientists are
   422	betting that their observation is just plain wrong, but they haven't
   423	yet been able to pinpoint why. And both Lauer and Postman admit that
   424	the effect may wash out as they collect more data from deeper in
   425	space.
   426	
   427	If it holds up, though, the theorists will have to rethink their
   428	position in a hurry. One explanation for the observation would be that
   429	galaxies are being pulled toward a concentration of mass so huge that
   430	it would make the Great Attractor look like a joke. Another might be
   431	that the Big Bang may have been lopsided, so that the universe has
   432	more energy and mass in some sectors than in others. In that case, the
   433	anomalous motion is an illusion.
   434	
   435	But both ideas are almost impossible to reconcile with any known model
   436	of the universe. Admits Postman: ''If I'd been at the receiving end of
   437	this news, I'd be skeptical too. But the modus operandi of an observer
   438	is to report what Nature is telling us.'' And that's true whether or
   439	not the news conforms to the conventional wisdom.
   440	
   441	Princeton astrophysicist David Spergel offered a telling historical
   442	anecdote in an address to colleagues at the American Astronomical
   443	Society's January meeting in Tucson, Arizona. In the 19th century, it
   444	dawned on astronomers that the orbits of Uranus and Mercury weren't
   445	exactly what theory predicted. So they proposed the existence of
   446	as-yet-undiscovered planets whose gravity was causing the anomalies --
   447	sort of the Cold Dark Matter of the time. Sure enough, Neptune finally
   448	appeared in their telescopes. But the other planet, Vulcan, never did
   449	materialize. In the end, said Spergel, it took the theory of general
   450	relativity to explain Mercury's odd behavior.
   451	
   452	Which story is applicable today? Will a crucial new observation tie up
   453	the loose ends in cosmology? Or do theorists need a fundamentally new
   454	framework for understanding the universe? ''I don't know,'' admits
   455	Spergel, noting that it's a lot easier to add bells and whistles like
   456	cosmic strings or a cosmological constant to existing theories than to
   457	come up with something as powerful as relativity.
   458	
   459	As they search for answers, the noisy clash of egos and the confusion
   460	of conflicting claims may be taken as signs that science is alive and
   461	well and likely on the cusp of a major new insight. Says
   462	astrophysicist John Bahcall of the Institute for Advanced Study in
   463	Princeton: ''Every time we get slapped down, we can say, 'Thank you
   464	Mother Nature,' because it means we're about to learn something
   465	important.''
