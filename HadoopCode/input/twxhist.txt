     3	        As our Moderator's response said, Telex certainly should be
     4	called the original form of E-Mail. Far from "dead" on a global basis,
     5	UN reports published in the "Brittanica Book of the Year" indicate
     6	there are about three million Telex lines around the globe.  Contrary
     7	to the impression international telephone people like to create,
     8	direct, immediate access via Telex still exists to more of the world's
     9	political entities than does telephone.  This has been the case for
    10	many years. (Totalitarian governments must like Telex; they have been
    11	known to shut down telephone service, but not Telex.  The suspected
    12	reason: It can be monitored with hard copy easily, and has often been
    13	done,too.  Of course, they themselves use it for military messages.)
    14	
    15	        Telex sprang from the same source as the Volkswagon automo-
    16	bile: The creative growth era of the early Third Reich. It was devised
    17	as a means to distribute military command and control messages and
    18	data in a time before we even had a structure for data processing
    19	machinery.  What existed at that point in time was 45.5 bps Baudot
    20	automatic telegraphy and dial-pulsing telephone exchanges.  The
    21	original Telex was essentially (director-controlled; yes, the
    22	Europeans were doing that then) rotary telephone switches modified to
    23	carry DC telegraph lines, providing a switched service for
    24	teletypewriters in the same way as was done for telephones.
    25	
    26	        There was one major difference: Intercity transmission
    27	facilites were expensive and in short supply, and one analog telephone
    28	circuit between cities could carry 24 (and in some applications, 25)
    29	telegraph channels bearing Telex.  The economics are obvious, and
    30	probably are what keep Telex important in the Third World today.
    31	
    32	        In that era of transparent analog transmission lines, Telex
    33	was easily able to use telephone dial-pulsing on the local telegraph
    34	loops followed by Baudot teletype for the messages ... and it did.
    35	Hence, this form of Telex operation became known as "type A Telex
    36	signaling." It is still used that way in many nations.  In those you
    37	will see a teleprinter with a control box that has a telephone dial.
    38	When Western Union decided it had should enter into Telex in the U.S.,
    39	it adopted the original style and Type A signaling.  Similarly, many
    40	other Europeans adopted Type A operations, among them the U.K., France
    41	and Belgium as well as others.  Meantime, (I think it was L. M.
    42	Ericsson leading the move for) others saw an opportunity to simply use
    43	the numerics on the keyboard for call set-up, thus some nations
    44	adopted what became known as "Type B" Telex.  By this time, the CCITT
    45	had taken charge and was setting international agreements, one of
    46	which was to set the speed of international Baudot circuits at 50
    47	Baud, instead of 45.5. Some few nations were many years behind in
    48	upspeeding. In this writer's experience, Cuba and Pakistan are
    49	remembered as still running 45.5 Baud Telex trunks even into the
    50	1970's.
    51	
    52	        Telex grew around the world very rapidly ... long before
    53	automatic telephony, again most likely due to its economics of channel
    54	usage.  Considerable networks of Telex on HF (shortwave) radio to
    55	then-remote areas of Africa, the Middle East and Asia were established
    56	by the government-owned PTTs, operating non-stop with error-correcting,
    57	retransmitting time division multiplexers per CCITT Recommendation
    58	R.44 (so what's new about TDM ... Baudot built his first one in 1873,
    59	three years _before_ Bell's telephone.  Check it out, unbelievers!),
    60	with the common name "TOR" for "Telex Over Radio."  Readers who are
    61	SWL's certainly hear of TOR, SITOR and Telex Mux on shortwave radio
    62	today ... there's still plenty around and on the air.
    63	
    64	        Also, the broad reach and universality of Telex around the
    65	world lead to the CCITT establishing the global network of
    66	International Telegram (commonly called Cablegram; RCA's product on
    67	its original shortwave radio was the Radiogram) channels on a switched
    68	network overlay of Telex called "Gentex."  That's right: Your
    69	international cablegram goes on Telex, too.  It's simply Telex
    70	channels dialed up permanently between telegram offices.  The beauty
    71	is that of any switched service: Restoration in case of channel
    72	failure is simply dialing up another call.
    73	
    74	        The result of all this is that Telex was, and remains in many
    75	nations, _the_ mediumn of communications for business and both civil
    76	and military government use.  Airlines using the PARS (and
    77	internationally IPARS) reservations systems still run Baudot code
    78	today (although many lines have changed to high-speed modem traffic),
    79	because their plain-language text transmissions use only 7.5 bits per
    80	character, compared to the 11 bits of CCITT International Alphabet 5
    81	(known as ASCII in colloqial North America).  The economics are
    82	obvious.  In many nations, the total minutes of international Telex
    83	still today exceeds that of international telephone traffic.  Business
    84	uses Telex more than most Americans understand.  West Germany has had
    85	more than 400,000 Telex lines for years, while the U.S. at its peak
    86	could count only 345,000 Telex _and_ TWX subscribers.  Americans
    87	simply grew up as sociological prisoners of "the phone," under a
    88	hegemony that taught them anything else must be insignificant.
    89	
    90	        Almost in parallel with the 1930's development of Telex, Bell
    91	interests saw the possibilities and decided to do Telex one better.
    92	Bell Labs was commissioned to develop a simialr service, using dial
    93	pulse selection. It became known as Teletypewriter Exchange Service,
    94	or TWX.  (In fact, Bell beat WUTCo to the marketplace punch and WUTCo
    95	came along later with Telex in the U.S.)  The original TWX ran 75 bps
    96	with Baudot code and dial selection, until Bell Labs got its second
    97	generation ready. That one, called "four-row TWX" in telephone
    98	parlance, used *modems* called "101 Data Sets" (that's right, Daddy of
    99	the 103!) on two-wire ordinary telephone subscriber lines run to
   100	special exchanges called a WADS (Wide Area Data Service) exchange in
   101	each major city, where the billing and such was done.  Actually, a
   102	WADS exchange was a partition of one local telephone exchange in the
   103	city. Because it was using the Public Switched Telephone Network (DDD
   104	in American parlance, TWX was given reserved area codes ... 510, 610,
   105	710, 810 and 910.  Some few remote locations on TWX are still on those
   106	area codes.
   107	
   108	        Four-row TWX used 11-bit characters to provide an expanded
   109	code set including "control characters" that permitted the TWX machine
   110	to be operated much like an office typewriter ... more so than Telex
   111	and its Baudot limitations that at best used CCITT-standardized
   112	"character strings" to provide some degree of functionality beyond
   113	plain text (see the CCITT F, R and S Series of Recommenda- tions). The
   114	control characters of TWX provided paragraph indents, form feeds and
   115	such that Telex never really had.  And, with Four-Row TWX,
   116	transmission (on the 101 Data Set) was upped to 110 bps, and the code
   117	provided VRC "parity" error-checking. (One can show that 110 bps with
   118	11-bit characters is equivalent to about 140-150 words per minute, a
   119	typing speed only Olympic-class typists could achieve on mechanical
   120	typewriters.)  Even so, the "TWX code" had only 93 of its 128 possible
   121	characters assigned.
   122	
   123	        It just so happened that when the computer era came along,
   124	Bell's Teletype Corporation (at Skokie, Il, purchased from Dr.
   125	Kleinschmidt to get a supply of teleprinters for TWX) had its Model 33
   126	teleprinter in production for TWX.  That was, in its time, the
   127	cheapest keyboard instrument readily available for the then-"new"
   128	computer business.  The Model 33 teleprinter and its mechanically-
   129	embedded TWX code became the _de_facto_ I/O device for the computer.
   130	The computer people early on wanted use of all the character
   131	combinations in the code, so Teletype obliged with modifications for
   132	computers.  Thus ASCII was born of TWX code, and it ultimately became
   133	CCITT International Telegraph Alphabet Number 5.  The IA5 definitions
   134	in the CCITT books vary from ASCII only in wording. Study of both
   135	ASCII and IA5 can show roots of most of the character combinations
   136	back to Baudot (or its CCITT character strings) and even manual
   137	telegraphy.
   138	
   139	However, computer programmers and computer mux makers who don't
   140	understand this have often done some horrible things to uses of the
   141	code, causing products that alienate people from data communications;
   142	wondering why their products don't migrate well or why people have
   143	trouble understanding them.  There is a certain beauty of human logic
   144	in using these codes properly.  They grew out of manual operations in
   145	sending messages.  One can even see in IBM's BCDIC and later EBCDIC an
   146	emulation of what was in the telegraphic codes, but I doubt IBMer's
   147	for their part would admit that.
   148	
   149	        While Telex was the rest of the world, insular America grew
   150	with its parallel Telex of WUTCo and TWX of Bell.  Because Bell was
   151	strictly limited to dial telephony only for international business,
   152	and because WUTCo had given up its international operations in a 1939
   153	deal to monopolize domestic telegraph business by taking over ITT's
   154	Postal Telegraph (which was a thorn in WUTCo's side), the U.S.
   155	developed a unique sort of "international telegraph" company known as
   156	an "International Record Carrier." The IRC's were an interesting
   157	catch-all sort of firm; an American answer to "how do we get a regu-
   158	latory handle on all these characters?"  Some were US-based, like
   159	WUTCo's "Cable System" that became Western Union International when
   160	sold off as a result of the 1939 Postal Telegraph deal.  Others had
   161	"just been there," like ITT's World Communications that had been a
   162	gaggle of companies with names like Federal Telegraph, All American
   163	Cables and Radio, Globe Wireless, Press Wireless, and the common
   164	carrier part of Mackay Marine.  RCA Communications had been around
   165	specializing largely in spanning the Pacific with radio as well as
   166	generally reaching ships and other places by radio telegraphy; today
   167	it is the RCA Globecom subsidiary of MCI (as is WUI, calling itself
   168	MCI International).  Tropical Radiotelegraph grew out of putting radio
   169	telegraph on shipboard before WWI so its owners, the United Fruit
   170	Company of Boston could divert shiploads of bananas to the best market,
   171	expanding to communications to its plantations, then becoming in
   172	some nations the public telegraph and international telephone company
   173	of the nation; today it is TRT Telecommunications.  The French
   174	Telegraph Cable Company, owned by French investors in the PTT had been
   175	in the U.S. since the days of Monsier Puyer-Quartier laying telegraph
   176	cables from France to the U.S., hence its telegraphic routing address,
   177	PQ. Even the Firestone Tire & Rubber Company owned its own IRD, the
   178	Trans-Liberia Radiotelegraph Company, operating HF radio from Akron to
   179	its rubber plantations in Liberia.  (TL is still there in Akron, as a
   180	matter of fact.)
   181	
   182	        All these firms formed the U.S. IRC business and enjoyed a
   183	period of regulated competitiveness for thirty years or so. They were the
   184	Telex interface between the U.S. and the world, all connecting out to
   185	WUTCo Telex and (by performing "protocol conversion" long before
   186	computers did so,) Bell TWX.  International Telex users were
   187	confronted with some typical American confusion ... they had to prefix
   188	their Telex calls to America with added digits to steer their call via
   189	the IRC of their choice (in most nations) and then to either Telex or
   190	TWX for the U.S. domestic connection.
   191	
   192	        All that had to change when Congress "deregulated" the IRC's
   193	in 1982, four years before telephony had a similar change.  Restric-
   194	tions on AT&T providing only telephony were lifted; the IRC's were
   195	freed to operate anyplace as compared to a limited number of "gateway
   196	cities," WUTCo was permitted to go international once again, and
   197	everybody could compete for any kind of business.
   198	
   199	        That's what has happened in America, so you can call FTCC
   200	(formerly French Cable) as well as relative newcomers to the U.S.
   201	market like Cable & Wireless (from the U.K.) and ask them what deal
   202	they will offer in competition to AT&T or WUTCo, either domestically
   203	or internationally, for voice, data or video.
   204	
   205	        International Telex remains a basic business.  The various
   206	companies made various deals to interface to their Telex connections.
   207	MCI's is, of course, via WUI, the first IRC that MCI bought.
   208	AT&TMail's is via TRT. Along the evolutionary course of the later days
   209	of the IRC business, a firm was established called Graphic Scanning
   210	(IRC's have always tried to do something with facsimile, long before
   211	Group III machines made them the Office Toy of 1990, and Graphic
   212	Scanning got into the IRC field in this way), and Graphnet is
   213	Telenet's Telex connection.
   214	
   215	        As our moderator said, the E-Mail services all "alias" your
   216	E-Mail address to their IRC connection.  It's usually your numeric
   217	E-Mail address with a fixed prefix.  Example: My own AT&TMail numeric
   218	is 7281481. Its Telex alias is 157281481. On MCIMail, my numeric is
   219	4133373,and its Telex alias is 650-4133373.
   220	
   221	        The global Telex network has had since inception a handy
   222	"confirmation' convention called "Who Are You?" and each Telex machine
   223	is encoded with an "automatic answerback" that lets you know on
   224	connection and whenever you ask (WRU in Baudot; <ctrl-E> in ASCII)
   225	what machine you are connected to.  So, if you are an E-Mail user,
   226	your overseas correspondent will want to know your "network"and
   227	"answerback."  That's usually the Telex code for the IRC you're with
   228	and your E-Mail aplha address.  So, mine on MCIMail is MCI UW
   229	dkimberlin and on AT&TMail mine is TRT UT dkimberlin.  Really rather
   230	simple, when you understand the meaning and purpose of the IRC and
   231	international Telex.
   232	
   233	        One last word for this top-level exposition: Telex isn't so
   234	cheap compared to E-Mail.  If you have a regular correspondent in
   235	another nation and want to DDD to batch files, or if you have an X.25
   236	or Teletex route to another nation (WUTCo's Easylink E-Mail does, but
   237	the other E-Mails seem to say,"huh? Teletex?"), that may well be
   238	cheaper than Telex.  It runs at 50 bps, just 66 words per minute, and
   239	you get billed at the Telex output rate.
   240	
   241	        All that said, then why bother? Well, Telex is still there and
   242	readily accessible from your E-Mail, and it reaches those 3-1/2
   243	million or so machines in offices of foreign nations you may have only
   244	occasional traffic for. And, those machines are in global directories
   245	like the Jaeger u. Waldmann directories so you can look them up from
   246	home. And, those machines are in hotels all around the world, so you
   247	can get a message to the traveler who hasn't been able to get a phone
   248	line out for three days.  And, those Telex lines connect to all the
   249	cablegram offices that will for their high price, still send a
   250	messenger to _find_ your missing salesman (unlike the US' rapidly
   251	deteriorating telegram service).  As well, they reach the ships at sea
   252	with your Telex to roust up the staffer who's on an ocean cruise.  No
   253	matter where in the world they are; no matter what time zone they are
   254	in, no matter if they are on the Gregorian or Moslem or Hindu or
   255	Bhuddist calendar, your message routed by Telex should get to them far
   256	more efficiently than random dialing of the phone.
   257	
   258	        So, while most Americans discovered some of these advantages
   259	when the Group III fax came along, but still need to find a "fax
   260	number" that's not in a directory like Jaeger u. Waldmann, your E-Mail
   261	connection to international Telex is a potentially useful tool.
   262	
   263	        (For those who may want a fuller, more detailed explanation,
   264	Datapro Research offers reprints of a 22-page 1986 report they had me
   265	author, numbered MT20-510-101, by calling (800) 328-3776.  Readers who
   266	have Datapro's "Nanagement of Telecommunications" service may have
   267	this at hand.)
   268	
   269	A final riposte: Our Moderator said in commenting to the question:
   270	
   271	>In case you were wondering, FAX is the (FA)csimile E(X)change.
   272	
   273	Au contraire, notre cher moduerateur.  While some marketeers of recent
   274	facsimile service offerings may have made that linkage, the term "fax"
   275	has been used generically by the much more limited group of facsimile
   276	(including telephoto) users from telecomm time immemorial.
