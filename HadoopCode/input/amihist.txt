     1	   On Monday March 2, RJ Mical (=RJ=) spoke at the Boston Computer Society
     2	meeting in Cambridge.
     3	
     4	   Fortunately I was momentarily possessed with an organizational passion,
     5	and I took copious notes.  I present them here filtered only through my
     6	memory and my Ann Arbor.  My comments are in [square brackets].  What
     7	follows is a neutron-star-condensed version of about three and one half
     8	hours of completely uninterrupted discussion.

    12	PART 1 - The Rise and Fall of Amiga Computer Inc.
    13	==== === === ==== === ==== == ===== ======== ====

    16	The Early Days
    17	--- ----- ----
    18	   Amiga Computer Inc. had its beginnings, strangely enough, RJ began, with
    19	the idea of three Florida doctors who had a spare $7 million to invest.
    20	They thought of opening a department store franchise, but (as RJ said) they
    21	wanted to try something a bit more exciting.  So they decided to start a
    22	computer company.  "Yeah, that's it!  A computer company!  That's the
    23	ticket!  :-)"
    24	
    25	   They found Jay Miner, who was then at Atari (boo hiss) and Dave Morse,
    26	the VP of sales (you can see their orientation right off..) they lifted
    27	>from Tonka Toys.  The idea right from the start was to make the most killer
    28	game box they could.  That was it, and nothing more. However Jay and the
    29	techies had other ideas.  Fortunately they concealed them well, so the
    30	upper management types still thought they were just getting a great game
    31	machine.  Of course the market for machines like that was hot hot hot in
    32	1982...
    33	
    34	   They got the name out of the thesaurus; they wanted to convey the
    35	thought of friendliness, and Amiga was the first synonym in the list.  The
    36	fact that it came lexically before Apple didn't hurt any either, said RJ.
    37	
    38	   However before they could get a machine out the door, they wanted to
    39	establish a "market presence" which would give them an established name and
    40	some distribution channels - keep thinking "game machine" - which they did
    41	by selling peripherals and software that they bought the rights to from
    42	other vendors.  Principal among these was the Joyboard, a sort of joystick
    43	that you stand on, and you sway and wiggle your hips to control the
    44	switches under the base.  They had a ski game of course, and some track &
    45	field type games that they sold with this Joyboard. But one game the folks
    46	at Amiga Inc. thought up themselves was the Zen Meditation game, where you
    47	sat on the Joyboard and tried to remain perfectly motionless.  This was
    48	perfect relaxation from product development, as well as from the ski game. 
    49	And in fact, this is where the term Guru Meditation comes from; the only
    50	way to keep sane when your machine crashes all the time is the ol'
    51	Joyboard.  The execs tried to get them to take out the Guru, but the early
    52	developers, bless 'em, raised such a hue and cry they had to put it back in
    53	right away.
    54	
    55	   When RJ interviewed with Amiga Computer (he had been at Williams) in
    56	July 1983, the retail price target for the Amiga was $400.  Perfect for a
    57	killer game machine.  By the time he accepted three weeks later, the target
    58	was up to $600 and rising fast.  Partly this was due to the bottom dropping
    59	completely out of the game market; the doctors and the execs knew they had
    60	to have something more than just another game box to survive.  That's when
    61	the techies' foresight in designing in everything from disk controllers to
    62	keyboard (yes, the original original Amiga had NO KEYBOARD), ports, and
    63	disk drives began to pay off.
    64	
    65	   The exciting part of the Amiga's development, in a way its adolescence,
    66	that magical time of loss of innocence and exposure to the beauties and
    67	cruelties of the real world, began as plans were made to introduce it,
    68	secretly of course, at the winter CES on January 4th, 1984(?).
    69	
    70	
    71	Adolescence
    72	-----------
    73	   The software was done ten days before the CES, and running fine on the
    74	simulators.  Unfortunately when the hardware was finally powered up several
    75	days later, (surprise) it didn't match its simulations.  This hardware, of
    76	course, was still not in silicon.  The custom chips were in fact large
    77	breadboards, placed vertically around a central core and wired together
    78	round the edges like a Cray.  Each of the three custom `chips' had one of
    79	these towers, each one a mass of wires.  According to RJ, the path leading
    80	up to the first Amiga breadboard, with its roll-out antistatic flooring,
    81	the antistatic walls just wide enough apart for one person to fit through
    82	and all the signs saying Ground Thyself, made one think of nothing so much
    83	as an altar to some technology god.
    84	
    85	   After working feverishly right up to the opening minutes of the CES,
    86	including most everybody working on Christmas, they had a working Amiga,
    87	still in breadboard, at the show in the booth in a special enclosed gray
    88	room, so they could give private demos.  Unfortunately if you rode up the
    89	exhibit-hall escalator and craned your neck, you could see into the room
    90	>from the top.
    91	
    92	   The Amiga was, RJ reminisced, the hardest he or most anyone there had
    93	ever worked.  "We worked with a great passion...my most cherished memory is
    94	how much we cared about what we were doing.  We had something to prove...a
    95	real love for it.  We created our own sense of family out there."
    96	
    97	   After the first successful night of the CES, all the marketing guys got
    98	dollar signs in their eyes because the Amiga made SUCH a splash even though
    99	they were trying to keep it "secret."
   100	
   101	   And so they took out all the technical staff for Italian food, everyone
   102	got drunk and then they wandered back to the exhibit hall to work some more
   103	on demos, quick bug fixes, features that didn't work, and so on.  At CES
   104	everyone worked about 20 hours a day, when they weren't eating or sleeping.
   105	
   106	   RJ and Dale Luck were known as the "dancing fools" around the office
   107	because they'd play really loud music and dance around during compiles to
   108	stay awake.
   109	
   110	   Late that night, in their drunken stupor, Dale and RJ put the finishing
   111	touches on what would become the canonical Amiga demo, Boing.
   112	
   113	   At last the true story is told.
   114	
   115	
   116	Money Problems
   117	----- --------
   118	   After the CES, Amiga Inc. was very nearly broke and heavily in debt. It
   119	had cost quite a bit more than the original $7 million to bring the Amiga
   120	even that far, and lots more time and money were needed to bring it to the
   121	market.  Unfortunately the doctors wanted out, and wouldn't invest any
   122	more.  So outside funding was needed, and quick.
   123	
   124	   The VP of Finance balanced things for a little while, and even though
   125	they were $11 million in the hole they managed to pay off the longest-
   126	standing debts and keep one step ahead of Chapter 11.  After much
   127	scrounging, they got enough money to take them to the June CES; for that
   128	they had REAL WORKING SILICON.  People kept peeking under the skirts of the
   129	booth tables asking "Where's the REAL computer generating these displays?"
   130	
   131	   Now money started flowing and interest was really being generated in the
   132	media.  And like most small companies, as soon as the money came in the
   133	door it was spent.  More people were added - hardware folks to optimize and
   134	cost-reduce the design; software people to finish the OS.  Even the sudden
   135	influx of cash was only enough to keep them out of bankruptcy, though; they
   136	were still broke and getting broker all the time.  How much WOULD have been
   137	enough?   RJ said that if he were starting over, he'd need about $49
   138	million to take the machine from design idea to market.  Of course Amiga
   139	Inc. had nowhere near that much, and they were feeling the crunch.  Every-
   140	body tightened their belts and persevered somehow.  They actually were at
   141	one point so broke they couldn't meet their payroll; Dave Morse, the VP of
   142	Sales, took out a second mortgage on his house to help cover it, but it
   143	still wasn't enough.
   144	
   145	   They knew they were going under, and unless they could find someone
   146	quick to buy them out they were going to be looking for jobs very shortly.
   147	They talked to Sony, to Apple, to Phillips and HP, Silicon Graphics (who
   148	just wanted the chips) and even Sears.  Finally...they called Atari. (Boo!
   149	Hiss! [literally - the audience hissed at Jack Tramiel's name!])  Trying to
   150	be discreet, RJ's only personal comment on Jack Tramiel was (and it took
   151	him a while to formulate this sentence) "an interesting product of the
   152	capitalist system."  Ahem.  Apparently Tramiel has been quoted as saying
   153	"Business is War."  Tramiel had recently left Commodore in a huff and
   154	bought Atari "undercover" so that by the time he left C= he was already CEO
   155	of Atari.
   156	
   157	   Realizing that Commodore was coming out with their own hot game machine,
   158	Tramiel figured he'd revenge himself on them for dumping him by buying
   159	Amiga Inc. and driving C= down the tubes with "his" superior product.  So
   160	Atari gave them half a million just for negotiating for a month; that money
   161	was gone in a day.
   162	
   163	   Of course Tramiel saw that Amiga Inc. wasn't in a very good bargaining
   164	position; basically unless they were bought they were on the street.  So he
   165	offered them 98 cents a share; Dave Morse held out for $2.00.  But instead
   166	of bargaining in good faith, every time Morse and Amiga tried to meet them
   167	halfway their bid went down!
   168	
   169	"Okay, $1.50 a share.
   170	   No, we think we'll give you 80 cents.
   171	How about $1.25?
   172	   70 cents."
   173	
   174	And so on...
   175	
   176	   Even Dave Morse, the staunchest believer in the concept that was the
   177	Amiga, the guiding light who made everyone's hair stand on end when he
   178	walked into the room, was getting depressed.  Gloom set in.  Things looked
   179	grim.
   180	
   181	   Then, just three days before the month deadline was up, Commodore
   182	called.  Two days later they bought Amiga Inc. for $4.25 a share. They
   183	offered them $4.00, but Dave Morse TURNED THEM DOWN saying it wasn't
   184	acceptable to his employees; he was on the verge of walking out when they
   185	offered $4.25.  He signed right then and there.
   186	
   187	
   188	The Commodore Years
   189	--- --------- -----
   190	   Commodore gave them $27 million for development; they'd never seen that
   191	much money in one place before.  They went right out and bought a Sun
   192	workstation for every software person, with Ethernet and disk servers and
   193	everything.  The excitement was back.
   194	
   195	   Commodore did many good things for the Amiga; not only did they cost-
   196	reduce it without losing much functionality, they had this concept of it as
   197	a business machine; this was a very different attitude from what Amiga Inc.
   198	had been working with.  Because of that philosophy, they improved the
   199	keyboard [ha! - garyo] and made lots of other little improvements that RJ
   200	didn't elaborate on.
   201	
   202	   What could Commodore have given them that they didn't?  The one thing RJ
   203	wanted most from them was an extra 18 months of development time. Unfortu-
   204	nately Commodore wasn't exactly rich right then either, so they had to
   205	bring out the product ASAP [and when is it ever any different?]  Also, he
   206	said, they could have MARKETED it.  (applause!).  If he'd had that extra 18
   207	months, he could have made Intuition a device rather than a separate kind
   208	of thing; he could have released it much more bug-free.
   209	
   210	   As far as marketing goes, the old ad agency has been fired; we should
   211	see some new Amiga ads real soon now.
   212	
   213	
   214	The Future
   215	--- ------
   216	   RJ's advice for A1000 owners: "Keep what you've got.  It's not worth it
   217	to trade up.  The A1000 is really a better machine."
   218	
   219	   This may be sour grapes on RJ's part, since the Amiga 2000 was designed
   220	in Braunschweig, West Germany, and the version of the A2000 being worked on
   221	in Los Gatos was rejected in favor of the Braunschweig-Commodore version. 
   222	However the A1000 compares to the A2000, though, the Los Gatos 2000 would
   223	have certainly been better than either machine.  C= management vetoed it
   224	because Braunschweig promised a faster design turnaround (and, to their
   225	credit, were much faster in execution than the Los Gatos group would have
   226	been) and more cost-reduction, which was their specialty.  Los Gatos, on
   227	the other hand, wanted a dream machine with vastly expanded capabilities in
   228	every facet of the machine.  The cruel financial facts forced C= to go with
   229	the Business Computer Group, who did the Sidecar in Braunschweig as well,
   230	and quickly and cheaply.
   231	
   232	   So they fired more than half the staff at the original Los Gatos
   233	facility, one by one.  That trauma was to some extent played out on the
   234	net; no doubt many of you remember it as a very difficult and emotional
   235	time.  There are now only six people left in Los Gatos, and their lease
   236	expires in March, so thus expires the original Amiga group.
   237	
   238	   And that's how RJ ended his talk; the rise and fall of Amiga Computer
   239	Inc.  The future of the Amiga is now in the hands of Westchester and
   240	Braunschweig, and who knows what direction it will take?
   241

   244	PART 2 - Technical Questions From the Audience
   245	==== === ========= ========= ==== === ========
   246	
   247	
   248	   I'll just make this part a list of technical questions and answers,
   249	since that was the format at the talk anyway.  This part is part technical
   250	inquiries and part total rumor mill; caveat emptor.
   251	
   252	   Q's are from the audience, A's are =RJ=.
   253	
   254	............................................................................
   255	
   256	Q: When is 1.3 coming and what's in it?
   257	
   258	A: 1.3 (or maybe it'll be called 1.2A) will be mostly just 1.2 with hard
   259	   disk boot; it'll look for Workbench on dh0: as well as df0:.
   260	
   261	   No one is working on it right now, although there are people in West
   262	   Chester planning it.
   263	
   264	
   265	Q: Can you do double buffering with Intuition?
   266	A: Pop answer: No.  Thought-out: well, yes, but it's not easy.  Use
   267	   MenuVerify and don't change the display while menus are up.  It's pretty
   268	   hairy.
   269	
   270	
   271	Q: How big is intuition (source code)?
   272	A: The listings (commented) are about a foot thick, 60 lpp, 1 inch margins.
   273	
   274	
   275	Q: Where did MetaComCo come into the Amiga story?
   276	A: MCC's AmigaDOS was a backup plan; the original Los Gatos-written
   277	   AmigaDOS was done with some co-developers who dropped out due to
   278	   contract and money hassles when C= bought Amiga.  Then MCC had to crank
   279	   EXTREMELY hard to get their BCPL DOS into the system at the last
   280	   possible minute.
   281	
   282	
   283	Q: Why isn't the Sidecar out?
   284	A: Who knows?  It passed FCC in December...
   285	
   286	
   287	Q: Why no MMU?
   288	A: Several reasons.  Obviously, cost was a factor.  MMUs available at the
   289	   time the Amiga was designed also consumed system time [this is what he
   290	   said- I'm just the scribe]; although newer MMUs solve this problem they
   291	   were too late for the Amiga.
   292	
   293	   Second, the original goal of the Amiga was to be a killer game machine
   294	   with easy low-level access, and an MMU didn't seem necessary for a game
   295	   machine.
   296	
   297	   Third [get this!] with an MMU, message-passing becomes MUCH MUCH hairier
   298	   and slower, since in the Amiga messages are passed by just passing a
   299	   pointer to someone else's memory.  With protection, either public memory
   300	   would need to be done and system calls issued to allocate it, etc., or
   301	   the entire message would have to be passed.  Yecch.  So the lack of MMU
   302	   actually speeds up the basic operation of the Amiga several fold.
   303	
   304	
   305	Q: Why no resource tracking?
   306	A: The original AmigaDOS/Exec had resource tracking; it's a shame it died.
   307	
   308	
   309	Q: How is your game coming? [??]
   310	A: It's just now becoming a front-burner project.  It's number crunch
   311	   intensive; hopefully it will even take over the PC part of the 2000 for
   312	   extra crunch.  It's half action, half strategy; the 'creation' part is
   313	   done, only the playing part needs to be written.  Next question. :-)
   314	
   315	
   316	Q: Will there ever be an advanced version of the chip set?
   317	A: Well, Jay Miner isn't working on anything right now...   [RUMOR ALERT]
   318	   The chip folks left in Los Gatos who are losing their lease in March
   319	   were at one time thinking about 1k square 2meg chip space 128-color
   320	   graphics, although still with 4 bit color DACs though... and even stuff
   321	   like a blitter per plane (!!) They were supposed to be done now, in the
   322	   original plans; the chip designers will be gone in March, but the design
   323	   may (?) continue in West Chester.  Maybe they'll be here two years from
   324	   now.
   325	
   326	
   327	Q: What will happen to the unused Los Gatos A2000 design?
   328	A: ??????
   329	
   330	
   331	Q: Should I upgrade from my 1000 to a 20
   332	00?
   333	A: Probably not.  The 2000 isn't enough better to justify the cost.  Unless
   334	   you need the PC compatibility, RJ advocated staying with the 1000. 
   335	   After all the 2000 doesn't have the nifty garage for the keyboard...:-) 
   336	   The A1000 keyboard is better built; you can have kickstart on disk; it's
   337	   smaller and a LOT quieter, [maybe not than the old internal drives!!!]
   338	   and uses less power; the 2000 has no composite video out, plus the RGB
   339	   quality is a tad worse.  Composite video (PAL or NTSC) is an extra-cost
   340	   option with the 2000.
   341	
   342	
   343	Q: Have you ever seen a working Amiga-Live!?
   344	A: Yes, I've seen it taking 32-color images at 16fps, and HAM pictures at
   345	   something like half that. [!!]  It's all done and working.  I don't know
   346	   why it's not out.  It sure beats Digiview at 8 seconds per image!
   347	
   348	
   349	Q: What do you use for Amiga development tools?
   350	A: DPaint and Infominder, Aztec C, Andy Finkel's Microemacs.
   351	
   352	Q: What's the future of the A1000?
   353	A: They aren't making any right now; they're just shipping from stock.  But
   354	   they do claim that they intend to continue making them.
   355	
   356	
   357	Q: Is MetaComCo's stuff all really slow, or what? :-)
   358	A: Yes, it is slow.  But don't knock it, it works.
   359	
   360	
   361	Q: Who is the competition for Amiga right now?
   362	A: The new Macs are so expensive, they're not a threat to the 2000, much
   363	   less the 1000.  Atari's new stuff "doesn't impress me."  [that's all he
   364	   said.]
   365	
   366	
   367	Q: What can I do about lack of Amiga ads, and the quality of the ones that
   368	   do exist?
   369	A: Write (don't call) Clive Smith in Marketing at Westchester and tell him
   370	   they need better ads.
   371	
   372	
   373	Q: Why are the pixels 10% higher than wide?
   374	A: The hardware came out that way, and it would have been a pain to do it
   375	   any other way due to sync-rate-multiple timing constraints.
   376
