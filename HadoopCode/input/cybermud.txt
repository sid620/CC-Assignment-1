     9	It has come to my attention that some people hold rather
    10	tightly to the notion of a 'real world' or 'real life' (RL),
    11	and that this is often distinguished from places known as MUDs
    12	or things known as 'virtual worlds'.
    13	
    14	When I first encountered this (in cyberMUDs) something struck me as
    15	strange and ill-conceived about it.  How could people be sure what
    16	was 'real' and what was 'virtual', especially the better educated
    17	of the lot, when philosophers had argued the point for ages and
    18	countless mystics had suggested that what we take for 'reality' is a
    19	mere reflection, a fragment of the real.
    20	
    21	I took to challenging people regarding these notions and eventually,
    22	through socratic dialogue with a few MUD philosophers, came to develop
    23	a theory which uses the model of the MUD for modern psychology/mysticism.
    24	Below is the present form of this theory, and I'd appreciate any feedback
    25	that might be offered.  Review, comments and disputation are
    26	enthusiastically requested.

    44	The MUD as a Basis for Western Mysticism
    45	by Thyagi NagaSiva

    47	
    48	1. Realms and Worlds
    49	
    50	'Realm', 'world' and 'MUD' (Multi-User Dimension, to be defined below),
    51	are here synonyms.   They describe a bounded sphere of perception.
    52	A 'virtual world' is a realm which is apparent to some senses but
    53	not to others (whether or not they appear within all dimensions of
    54	sensation).
    55	
    56	
    57	2. Multi-User Dimensions (MUD),
    58	
    59	More specifically then, by MUD we refer to a realm of measurement
    60	(dimension) which makes possible or allows more than one (multi)
    61	locus of change (user).  Where 'realm' and 'world' are fairly ambiguous,
    62	MUD is a technical term with specific meaning and synonomous
    63	application.
    64	
    65	
    66	3. The CyberMUD or Cyber Realm, and the NONcyber Realm
    67	
    68	A cybermMUD or 'cyber realm' is one which is reached via
    69	a computer (by whatever definition). It may be contrasted with
    70	a NONcyber realm in two major ways:
    71	
    72	A) The cyber realm seems to depend upon the NONcyber realm for
    73	its existence (but this cannot be proven), and
    74	
    75	B) The cyber realm is dependent upon some computer for its
    76	ultimate form (whether or not this computer is NONcyber-based).
    77	
    78	
    79	4. Reality, Virtual Reality, and Real Life (RL)
    80	
    81	The term 'reality' is commonly used as a substitute for 'realm',
    82	yet we reserve it for a specific meaning.  Here the phrase
    83	'virtual reality' is an oxymoron, and this will become apparent
    84	below.
    85	
    86	The common assumption is that cyber realms are MUDs and NONcyber
    87	realms are NOT (i.e. that NONcyber realms are 'reality').
    88	However, given the definitions above we can posit that what most
    89	people call 'real life' (RL) is actually an experience within a
    90	NONcyber realm of subjective or objective dimensions.
    91	
    92	We have multiple selves, arising from the combined complex of our
    93	social roles, that vie for supremacy within the dimension of our
    94	personal mindspace.  This is the subject dimension, the 'me-MUD'.
    95	It includes feelings, thoughts and the entire range of subjective
    96	experience.
    97	
    98	There appears to be a world of shapes and objects around us.  We
    99	maneuver, physically, through the familiar subrealms of 'height',
   100	'width' and 'depth' and manipulate or interact with entities and
   101	objects within them.  This is the object dimension, the 'space-MUD'.
   102	It is the one which people assume to be more 'real' based upon their
   103	perception that it contains cyberMUDs and gives rise to the me-MUD.
   104	
   105	Taking one (NONcyber, space-MUD) as pre-eminent based
   106	solely on the grounds of origin (cyber realms seem to originate
   107	from NONcyber technologies) is quite commom.  For example,
   108	many people  assume that NONcyber personalities are somehow
   109	more 'real' than their cyber counterpart, even if these personae
   110	(socially imagined constructs deriving from communication
   111	styles and appearance) are comparable in all respects save origin.
   112	
   113	That they distinguish one as 'real' and the other as 'virtual' or
   114	'imaginary' displays the bias toward the default dimension
   115	(quite reasonably), but tells us nothing about what 'real' means
   116	aside from 'preferred' or 'longer-lasting'.
   117	
   118	
   119	5. The Real World and RL
   120	
   121	We shall here take for our definition of the 'real world' that
   122	realm which is a superset of all MUDs.  That superset upon which
   123	all other dimensions depend is logically the 'real'.  Plato
   124	claimed that the real world is the world of Forms or Ideas, and
   125	many other philosophers offer their own speculation as to what
   126	constitutes the 'Source Code of Existence' as we know it.
   127	
   128	'The superset of all MUDs' is not an easy concept to understand.
   129	It transcends both the MUD of our subjective experience and
   130	the MUD of 'space' (I leave 'time', which connects and/or
   131	interweaves these two, for future speculation).   It is easy to see
   132	why any aspect of RL in THIS context must be beyond words to some
   133	extent, especially when attempting to ascertain information about
   134	'you' or 'me', or indeed any isolated object/subject.
   135	
   136	To say 'I went shopping in RL' would seem not only fallacious,
   137	but completely dishonest.  No separate 'individual' can ever
   138	'do' anything in 'RL', not when we take it to be this superset,
   139	this Unity which includes all dimensions of subject and object.
   140	
   141	A note about Unity seems necessary.  When speaking of 'Unity', it
   142	is not meaningful to compare this with 'Diversity'.  The reason for this
   143	is that the unity here implied transcends all lingual expressions.
   144	For the same reason that 'Spirit' cannot be compared with 'Matter'
   145	because in the nondual realm Spirit and Matter are One, so also is
   146	Diversity identical to Unity and vice versa.  The term is only a useful
   147	indicator of the realm or dimension (that superset) to which we refer.
   148	
   149	Given this, the real world is a subject/object Unity, toward which
   150	many religious paths point and about which we shall never
   151	obtain a completely accurate lingual expression (due to the
   152	disunitive nature of language).
   153	
   154	Comments about RL, therefore, are of a MYSTICAL nature, within
   155	this context, rather than a 'practical' one. They apply, perhaps
   156	abstractly, to that superset which some Christians call 'Heaven'
   157	and some Buddhists might call 'Nirvana'.
   158	
   159	
   160	6. RL and MUDs
   161	
   162	RL is mystical experience, since it occurs in the dimension of
   163	Unified nonduality and it would seem to depend upon the QUALITY of
   164	its manifestation rather than on the location of particular objects
   165	or subjects.  We may thus find RL in any MUD, since all MUDs are
   166	contained by the real world and may include Unitive experiences.
   167	
   168	A MUD is a world of flux, where the real is in some ways beyond change,
   169	enveloping a 'becoming beingness' that is not usually perceived in
   170	ordinary states of consciousness.  To encounter RL, therefore, is to
   171	become unified with the divine, the God of Platonic and Hermetic
   172	Christians, who is both beyond and within the MUD experience, at once
   173	transcending and subsuming it.
   174	
   175	A MUD is the equivalent of  Carse's 'finite game', in which we assume
   176	for the purposes of the game that certain rules are unbreakable
   177	(i.e. the subject/object division) and that our goal is to somehow 'win'.
   178	Carse speculates that the goal of the infinite game (the real world)
   179	is to continue playing, and no foolish notions about 'death' or
   180	'morality' or 'identity' get in the way of an infinite player.
   181	
   182	
   183	7. InterMUD Studies
   184	
   185	The 'real' would seem to be approachable by examining all experiences
   186	and coming to some determination as to their source.  Modern
   187	Science's objective examination of the nature of matter is one aspect
   188	of this search.  Mystical exploration and experimentation in the world
   189	of the subject is another.
   190	
   191	Searches of these types are limited by the techniques used within the
   192	particular MUD.  We shall not determine a purely physical source
   193	for experience because experience is not entirely objective.  Likewise,
   194	we shall not discover a purely mental source because experience
   195	is not entirely subjective.
   196	
   197	InterMUD studies such as those by Fritjof Capra and Gary Zukav,
   198	popular  scientific explanations  of the comparisons between objective
   199	and  subjective explorations, are quite important.  They point out the
   200	boundaries and connections between MUDs (not only the subject/object
   201	MUDs but also those of academic and popular cultures).
   202	
   203	They indicate the paradoxes, the eddies and vortices that arise
   204	as a result of entering one particular finite game and looking at
   205	another.  They show us the similarities between worlds, how one
   206	can be used to understand another, and how the real world surpasses
   207	our ability to explain.
   208	
   209	
   210	8. Entrenchment and Abstraction
   211	
   212	Of course those who entrench themselves within one particular MUD
   213	(such as those who argue vehemently for the 'reality' of the object
   214	MUD, for example) will not understand such interMUD studies, nor will
   215	they acknowledge the meaning and accuracy of terms which apply to
   216	realms outside their entrenchment.  This is to be expected.
   217	
   218	When my 'reality' is comprised solely of objects, of surface tension
   219	and physical principles, I cannot then see the veracity of descriptions
   220	regarding subjective referents.  'Soul', 'spirit', 'emotion' and even
   221	'mind' are to be described in physical terms if they are to have any
   222	meaning for me.
   223	
   224	Those who speak of objects in 'abstract' terminology as if they
   225	were in any sense 'real' are either mistaken or confusing to me due to
   226	their 'abstractness'.  'Abs
