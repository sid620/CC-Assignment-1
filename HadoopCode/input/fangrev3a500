    14	    Hi there superfat Agus fans,
    15	
    16	    here is the story of upgrading my A500 to 1MB Agnus.
    17	    After buying the Fat Lady (dfl 150,-) i opened up my A500 (for the
    18	    first time). I assumed that i had a REV 5 board, so the transition
    19	    should be fairly easy. What i found after removing all screws and
    20	    and shielding defies description. First of all there was no JP2
    21	    between the ROM and the CPU (oink), second there was no REV number on
    22	    the board (what ???), thirdly the _ROMEN pin on the Kickstart ROM was
    23	    torn out of its socket. Soldered to it was a blue wire wich on the 
    24	    other end connected to a 3D mounted transistor (shiver). After uttering
    25	    some strong words i also removed the bottom shielding. This revealed
    26	    some more manual modifications, and last but not least the REV number.
    27	    The REV number said 3. After sitting down and taking a deep breath i
    28	    tried to think of a sunny side of all this. All i could come up with
    29	    was that this board might be a collectors item by now (anybody
    30	    interested???).
    31	    
    32	    Now how to put Mrs. Obese in there? Since there was no JP2 i made my
    33	    own. What JP2 does on REV 5 boards is connecting A19 on Agnus to A23
    34	    or A19 on the CPU address bus. My Agnus A19 was hardwired to A23 on
    35	    the CPU address bus. So i carefully cut this connection on the bottom
    36	    side of the board between the CPU pins. Then i soldered in a new
    37	    connection from the CPU A19 (pin 47) to where the previously cut
    38	    connection runs through the board from bottom side to top side, thus
    39	    effectuating a connection between CPU A19 and Agnus A19. The rest is
    40	    fairly straight forward. The _EXRAM signal on GARY must be kept high
    41	    thus preventing it to detect the RAM expansion. I did this by cutting
    42	    the connection near the GARY socket (pin 32) on the top side of the
    43	    board. The connection to a pullup which keeps pin 32 at VCC is still
    44	    intact since it runs under the socket in the opposite direction.
    45	
    46	    Now the only thing left to do was replacing HER. Ahh, wait a minute
    47	    wasn't there something about Agnus pin 41 and PAL/NTSC. Yes, Agnus
    48	    pin 41 should be kept at a high level to force a PAL display. Because
    49	    i live in Europe i'm kinda attached to PAL. So i bent the pin 41 
    50	    inside the Agnus socket outward (careful now), preventing it from
    51	    forcing the PAL/NTSC input to GND level. After putting Humpty Dumpty
    52	    back together again, i crossed my fingers and turned on the power ....
    53	    It worked. Avail reported somewhat over 1040K chipmem, hmm nice.
    54	    
    55	    I'am still in the process of trying out what software works, and what
    56	    doesn't anymore. Up till now only ACT OUT refused work altogether,
    57	    actually it GURUed. Furthermore, it is a pity that you must have fast
    58	    ram to use DPAINT-III's animation features. By the way, is there somebody
    59	    out there who has a list of programms that freak out when a 8272(A) is
    60	    installed ???
