     1	(Boston, MA) February 11, 1992 -- FTP Software, Inc., the leading developer
     2	of PC-based Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
     3	software, today announced and demonstrated at the NetWorld 92 Boston
     4	tradeshow, LANWatch version 2.04. LANWatch is FTP Software's
     5	software-only, hardware-independent, low-cost contribution to the LAN
     6	analyzer marketplace. Priced at only $1,200, LANWatch competes
     7	head-to-head functionally with products priced more than five times
     8	higher.
     9	
    10	"Originally developed for internal use, FTP Software priced LANWatch to
    11	appeal to the network managers for smaller businesses and individual
    12	consultants who don't want to spend a lot of money for an analyzer,"
    13	stated Bruce Campbell, director of product marketing. "Since LANWatch is a
    14	software-only package, it easily installs on existing PCs. This means that
    15	it is particularly good for field service engineers and network
    16	technicians who can carry just disks with them and install it when
    17	needed." LANWatch's affordable price also allows firms to purchase
    18	multiple copies, saving network developers valuable time often wasted
    19	waiting for one high-priced analyzer to become available.
    20	
    21	New Features Bring Compatibility to Additional Hardware And Protocols
    22	
    23	LANWatch is useful in the installation, troubleshooting and monitoring of a
    24	network. Running under DOS, LANWatch captures, parses, displays and saves
    25	packets to disk in real-time. The features of LANWatch's base package
    26	recognize over 400 protocols.
    27	
    28	LANWatch v.2.04 offers several new features for extending the product's
    29	compatibility with additional protocols and hardware, and improves its
    30	ability to monitor and troubleshoot networks. The enhancements include:
    31	
    32	* Support for NDIS Driver and Packet Driver. By using NDIS and Packet
    33	Driver, LANWatch is now compatible with any network interface card that
    34	will operate in promiscuous mode, which allows LANWatch to operate on most
    35	Ethernet, StarLAN, 10-basedT and Token Ring cards;
    36	
    37	* Complete NetWare 2.15 parsing and filtering, providing compatibility with
    38	over 90% of NetWare's installed base;
    39	
    40	* Improved NFS, RPC and Appletalk II parsing and filtering;
    41	
    42	* New filters, including: NET, which isolates traffic in a subnet; IP and
    43	MAC in English mode (in addition to numbers); and SNMP traps;
    44	
    45	* Layer highlighting in the HEX display mode.
    46	
    47	LANWatch Offers Full-Functionality Without Excessive Cost
    48	
    49	FTP Software introduced LANWatch in 1987 as a low-cost alternative to the
    50	higher-priced hardware-dependent analyzers. FTP Software designed LANWatch
    51	for use with Ethernet- and Token Ring-based networks, particularly those
    52	running TCP/IP. In addition to protocol analysis, LANWatch offers a host
    53	of other tools.
    54	
    55	LANWatch has two modes of operation. In Real-Time Mode, each line on the
    56	screen displays information on a single packet. A circular RAM buffer can
    57	store over 4,096 packets for high-speed capture of data, and utilities
    58	allow forward and backward searches to quickly locate desired packets.
    59	LANWatch can capture packets at a rate faster than 5,600 packets per
    60	second, depending on the network interface and PC hardware being used.
    61	
    62	In Examine Mode, users can utilize a variety of tools to search through
    63	packets, which LANWatch can automatically store to disk. Examine Mode's
    64	long format option shows the full contents of individual packets, useful
    65	for spotting errors.
    66	
    67	Using filters, LANWatch permits users to select a subset of packets for
    68	capture, display, storage or retrieval. LANWatch automatically isolates
    69	packets of interest, saving the user from sorting through network traffic
    70	to find specific packets. The analyzer searches for packets based on a
    71	variety of selection criteria, including addresses in several different
    72	protocol layers, protocol families, and Boolean "And", "Or", and "Not"
    73	operators. LANWatch also allows users to create their own filters,
    74	particularly important for professional developers.
    75	
    76	Utilizing LANWatch's protocol analysis features, software/protocol
    77	developers can debug and measure the performance of their new products.
    78	FTP Software also provides developers with source code for writing parses
    79	for new protocols.
    80	
    81	LANWatch recognizes TCP, IP, XNS, IPX, DECnet and VINES, and many others,
    82	displaying each protocol type in English and assigning it different color
    83	codes for easy identification. Users can add recognition for new protocols
    84	for parses and filters with the source code included in the base package.
    85	
    86	Pricing and Availability
    87	
    88	LANWatch version 2.04, available now directly from FTP Software, is priced
    89	at $1,200, with volume discounts available. The product installs easily on
    90	any PC or PS/2 equipped with a supported interface card.

    94	(Wakefield, MA), January 31, 1992 -- FTP Software, Inc., the leading
    95	developer of PC-based Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
    96	(TCP/IP) software, today announced the availability of its
    97	Interoperability Guide, a reference book that provides network managers
    98	and administrators with a general overview of TCP/IP and outlines methods
    99	for running TCP/IP for PCs concurrently with several network operating
   100	systems. FTP Software distributed 4,000 copies of the guide to attendees
   101	at last year's InterOp Show, and plans to repeat this service at the
   102	upcoming 1992 NetWorld-Boston show. Individuals not attending the show,
   103	but interested in receiving a free copy of the guide may contact the
   104	Company directly.
   105	
   106	Network administrators and managers have expressed an intensified interest
   107	in internetworking and how to make the theory of internetworking a
   108	reality. FTP Software, recognized in the PC TCP/IP market for its robust
   109	product line and superior technology, wants to give these individuals a
   110	resource for broadening their knowledge of internetworking.
   111	
   112	The Interoperability Guide, written by FTP Software personnel and targeted
   113	at both the technically adept network manager and the manager unfamiliar
   114	with many of the terms and concepts of TCP/IP networking, highlights the
   115	evolution of TCP/IP and provides important general networking background
   116	information and tools. Additionally, the book offers insights on how users
   117	can run TCP/IP for PCs simultaneously with several network operating
   118	systems, and the difference between technologies such as Packet Driver and
   119	NDIS.
   120	
   121	"FTP Software is well known for its excellent support staff and
   122	highly-skilled technical personnel," said Bruce Campbell, director of
   123	product marketing at FTP Software. "As the leaders in PC TCP/IP
   124	technology, we feel a certain responsibility for strengthening users'
   125	understanding of how TCP/IP can solve their networking problems. By making
   126	this book available, we hope to enlighten users on the power and
   127	flexibility of TCP/IP."
   128	
   129	FTP Software's founders were pioneers in the development of TCP/IP for PCs.
   130	John Romkey, one of the founders of FTP Software, developed both the first
   131	PC-based TCP/IP product and also the Packet Driver specification -- the
   132	first DOS standard for separating the network interface card driver code
   133	from a protocol stack -- now supported by over 100 vendors. Packet Driver
   134	allows TCP/IP and other transport protocols to share a common network
   135	interface card.
   136	
   137	Individuals interested in picking up the Interoperability Guide at the
   138	NetWorld-Boston show may stop by FTP Software's booth, #5000, to receive
   139	their free copy. Those not attending the show but still interested in
   140	receiving a copy of the guide may contact the Sales department at FTP
   141	Software at (617) 246-0900.
