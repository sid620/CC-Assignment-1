     8	       There is an allure to purchasing a laptop computer. They are 
     9	       small, sleek and highly productive. What features should you 
    10	       consider when purchasing a laptop? For those who need quick 
    11	       highlights first we'll present a brief overview for the cautious 
    12	       laptop buyer. Later in this tutorial we'll shift gears for a 
    13	       broader "beginners" overview. 
    14	
    15	       Before jumping into our tutorial, a reading recommendation. 
    16	       Visit your local library and locate a back issue of the August 
    17	       1992 edition of PC Magazine. That issue covered a variety of 
    18	       reviews concerning specific laptop machines and also contained 
    19	       some surprising suggestions for productive laptop use. While on 
    20	       the topic of pertinent reading, check for other useful titles in 
    21	       the reading list section elsewhere within this tutorial. 
    22	
    23	       Next, general suggestions for laptop buyers...
    24	       
    25	       1) The keyboard is the most important interactive part 
    26	       of any laptop. Is it awkward? Could you use it for longer than 
    27	       15 minutes? An hour? A complete morning at work? Note the 
    28	       location of frequently used keys like the backslash \, the F1 
    29	       function help key, the cursor control keys. Some oddball laptops 
    30	       require you to use a shift-funtion key combination for cursor 
    31	       keys. Not terribly comfortable. Othertimes the cursor position 
    32	       keys are oddly laid out in a non standard pattern which is 
    33	       difficult to use and memorize. One of the classic keyboard 
    34	       layouts is the Toshiba 286 T1200XE. Glance at the layout on this 
    35	       machine and compare it to your target laptop. 
    36	
    37	       2) The screen. Next to the keyboard this is the greatest delight 
    38	       - or pain - when it comes to using a laptop computer. Can you 
    39	       use it for longer than an hour? Screens can be either backlit or 
    40	       edgelit. Each has advantages. Try both and see which you like. A 
    41	       few clever laptops have screen reversing software built in which 
    42	       can change the screen from black lettering on a light field to 
    43	       light lettering on a dark field. Helpful for some folks. Ask if 
    44	       your target machine has it. Find out if you like it. Is the 
    45	       output VGA (display and run most software) or lowly CGA (run 
    46	       and display fewer packages?) Is there a port on the back so you 
    47	       can plug in your big monitor to the back of the laptop when you 
    48	       are home or at the office? Do you need to buy an adapter for 
    49	       this? On an airplane tray can the screen be tilted so that the 
    50	       seat in front does not bump into the screen edge? 
    51	
    52	       3) Weight. Fully outfitted with adapters, disks and batteries, 
    53	       what is the real "workday" weight of the laptop? Load the 
    54	       machine and accessories into a carrying case and heft it for a 
    55	       while. Brochures proclaim extremely light weight figures - in 
    56	       real life you will carry the computer and accessories.
    57	
    58	       4) Price. Determine the REAL price. You will need an AC 
    59	       adapater, carrying case and probably spare battery as a minimum. 
    60	       You will need DOS and some software. Beyond that, most people 
    61	       need a few manufacturer specific cables and sometimes a modem. 
    62	       Add it ALL up. 
    63	
    64	       5) Battery life is a touchy subject - ultimately the attraction
    65	       of laptops is the opportunity to get work done on the road. 
    66	       Battery life of an hour or so isn't much real work, when you 
    67	       think about it. Two to four hours on a fully charged battery is 
    68	       a working range today. Ask if the laptop has special battery 
    69	       saving features such as sleep mode, pause and resume, user 
    70	       selectable delays for drive and screen refresh use, powerdown 
    71	       mode, capability to change batteries without shutting down the 
    72	       machine and loosing data. Nice features. Is it easy and FAST to 
    73	       change batteries or a real chore? Look at the clasps and snaps 
    74	       as you open and close the battery compartment. 
    75	
    76	       6) Modems. Someday you will need one. Does the laptop have a 
    77	       standard serial modem slot to which any low priced modem can 
    78	       be attached or a proprietary manufacturer specific slot to which 
    79	       ONLY that manufacturer's (expensive) modem will attach? For a 
    80	       few extra dollars consider a modem with combined internal fax 
    81	       send and receive capability which is a godsend for travellers. 
    82	       Much cheaper in the long run than paying your hotel $6 per page 
    83	       to transmit and receive faxes. 
    84	
    85	       7) How much memory can you add to the laptop? For light word 
    86	       processing and spreadsheet work 640K may be all you need. But 
    87	       serious software use, Windows use or high end graphics may 
    88	       require 2 or more Megabytes of memory. How much can you install 
    89	       into the machine? How much will it cost? Can you install the 
    90	       additional memory or must the factory?
    91	
    92	       8) Drives. A standard 3.5 inch floppy drive is almost essential 
    93	       today. A hard drive, too, if you can afford it. If the laptop 
    94	       has no floppy, you might need to purchase special software and 
    95	       cables to transfer files between your laptop and desktop 
    96	       computer. One more expense. Back to the hard drive for a moment: 
    97	       if you work with large mailing lists, huge databases of clients 
    98	       or unusually large spreadsheets you MUST have a hard drive with 
    99	       larger than average capacity. Between 40MB to 100MB would be a 
   100	       wise investment for hard drive intensive storage applications.
   101	
   102	       9) Details. Beyond a serial port (for the modem or mouse) does 
   103	       it have a parallel port for a printer? How about capability for 
   104	       an external keyboard? Slot for math coprocessor? Null modem 
   105	       cable for transferring data between other computers.
   106	       
   107	       10) Form follows function. If you plan to use the laptop mostly 
   108	       as your PRIMARY machine at home and work, focus on maximum power 
   109	       and expandable features. If you are a power user of Windows and 
   110	       graphics software you will need VGA display, at least 2MD of ram 
   111	       and at least a 386SX processor. However, if your primary work is 
   112	       spent on the road in planes and trains, pay attention to long 
   113	       battery life and quickly interchangeable battery packs. 
   114	
   115	       11) Consider the new breed of tiny portable printers which work 
   116	       well with laptops. Included are the Diconix 150 Plus which 
   117	       weighs in at 3 pounds, Canon BJ-10 Bubblejet, Citizen PN48 and
   118	       Star Micronics StarJet SJ-48. All printers will need spare ink 
   119	       cartridges, printer cable, paper, AC power supply and spare 
   120	       batteries.
   121	
   122	       A brief glance at portable computer configurations....
   123	
   124	       Laptops are for the most part single-piece computer systems 
   125	       weighing in at between 7 to 15 pounds. In most cases the viewing 
   126	       screen opens in a characteristic "clamshell" manner. All are IBM 
   127	       compatible and most will functions from AC or battery power. 
   128	       Most offer some expanability in memory and some, but not all 
   129	       will even accept an expansion board. The latest designs can 
   130	       mater to a "docking module" which adds powerful desktop features 
   131	       when the units are used in a stationary office setting. Prices 
   132	       range from about $700 to well over $5,000 for advanced models.
   133	       Examples: the Toshiba T4400SX, Librex M386SL, Bondwell B-310SX, 
   134	       Dell 320LT.
   135	
   136	       Notebooks weigh in at 4 to 7 pounds and usually feature both AC 
   137	       and battery power. Both hard drive and floppy drive models are 
   138	       available. Prices range from $700 to about $2,000. By far 
   139	       notebooks are the most popular category in the consumer 
   140	       marketplace and for most users have the best balance of weight, 
   141	       cost and features. Examples: Epson NB3, Dell NX-20, Tandy 1800 
   142	       HD, Sharp 6220, Tandy 110 HD, NEC 286F UltraLite, Compaq LTE286, 
   143	       Toshiba T1200XE. 
   144	
   145	       Palmtops. The smallest of the small. Weighing in at a pound or 
   146	       less these machines features minaturized keyboards, vestpocket 
   147	       size, lack of hard or floppy drives and varying amounts of true 
   148	       IBM compatability. Features are sacrificed in the quest for 
   149	       miniaturization. Some, such as the Hewlett-Packard 95LX contain 
   150	       built in software such as the standard Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet.
   151	       At this writing, only the diminuitive Poqet palmtop is equipped 
   152	       to run most IBM compatable software. Tiny credit card sized 
   153	       memory modules are available for some models. Prices range from 
   154	       aobut $400 to over $2,000.
   155	
   156	       Next, a broader tutorial about buying a computer for the first 
   157	       time. A refresher course for the advanced. An eye opener for the 
   158	       beginner. Some topic areas also address concerns about larger 
   159	       desktop computers as well as smaller laptops - a broad base of 
   160	       information is usually useful so references to desktop 
   161	       computers has been included.
   162	       
   163	       Buying a new or used computer is always THE traumatic event. It 
   164	       seems to be easier if you merely NEED one for a definite office 
   165	       or productivity goal such as financial analysis or compiling a 
   166	       mailing list of customers. In that case, you can be logical and 
   167	       evaluate among several machines and take your time. If, however 
   168	       you WANT one because it sounds interesting and you feel a little 
   169	       lost when everyone in the neighborhood is discussing CPU WAIT 
   170	       STATES, you have some serious research ahead!  
   171	
   172	       From a use standpoint, start at the beginning: What do you want 
   173	       to do with the computer? What software applications will perform 
   174	       these tasks? After determining answers to those two questions, 
   175	       purchase as much computing power as you can afford which allows 
   176	       you to use all current software of interest as well as retaining 
   177	       the possibility of upgrading the machine later - more memory or a 
   178	       better video display, for example. 
   179	       
   180	       Simple applications like word processing, accounting and 
   181	       telecommunications may run equally fast on both budget and high 
   182	       end computers while sophisticated software such as drafting, 
   183	       large databases and desktop publishing may run so slowly on a 
   184	       low end computer that your wasted time far offsets the original 
   185	       savings on the budget computer. When in doubt run several 
   186	       software packages which provide features you want on the 
   187	       computer in question. 
   188	
   189	       Three technical factors are of interest when purchasing a 
   190	       computer: the type of CPU (central processing unit) which is the 
   191	       brains of a personal computer, the speed of the CPU and finally 
   192	       the choice between 8 bit and 16 bit CPU types. 
   193	
   194	       A brief refresher course: A bit is a binary digit used by 
   195	       computers to store and process data. Typically 8 bits are needed 
   196	       to construct a byte or computer character such as a number or 
   197	       letter. Eight bit processors can process one byte or character 
   198	       at a time. Sixteen bit processors can processor two bytes at a 
   199	       time. Faster is better for most folks - although speed has its 
   200	       price... 
   201	
   202	       In the IBM world of clone PC's there are four camps of CPU desire 
   203	       and capability.
   204	       
   205	       On the low end of price and performance are personal computers 
   206	       of the so-called XT class using the oldest processors such as 
   207	       the Intel 8088 (8 bit data bus outside the CPU and 16 bit data 
   208	       bus inside the CPU) which was used on the original IBM PC. The 
   209	       Intel 8086 CPU, alternatively, provides both 16 bit internal and 
   210	       external construction. A similar CPU is the NEC V-20 chip. 
   211	       Advantages, disadvantages and uses for these XT class machines? 
   212	
   213	       XT's are affordable. A basic machine with a couple of floppy 
   214	       drives, monitor and keyboard can be obtained for $300 to $400. 
   215	       XT class machines are useful for small and home office work or 
   216	       light hobbyist use such as word processing and accounting where 
   217	       speed is not of great concern. Generally XT class machines, as 
   218	       with all IBM clones, can be upgraded by the gradual (or 
   219	       immediate) addition of hard drives, color monitors and even 
   220	       faster processors. As a curious aside, this software package was 
   221	       programmed and edited entirely on an XT class machine. In a 
   222	       sense computing power does not derive from the machine, but HOW 
   223	       you use it! 
   224	
   225	       When is an XT not a good buy? If you intend to do CAD drafting, 
   226	       work with large database mailing list, or high resolution 
   227	       graphics, an XT is not a wise choice. If you ever to run 
   228	       the OS/2 operating system or Microsoft Windows which are 
   229	       advanced operating and display standards, XT machines are not a 
   230	       good idea. Finally, if you intend to expand the machine to 
   231	       color graphics such as an EGA or VGA standard or install large 
   232	       amounts of memory an XT is probably not an ideal choice. 
   233	
   234	       One step up the ladder in performance and price is the AT class 
   235	       machine which runs an Intel (or alternate manufacturer) 80286 
   236	       CPU chip. The machine is usually 2 to 4 times faster than an XT 
   237	       class machine at perhaps $200 more in price. For most people an 
   238	       AT class machine is a comfortable choice since it can not only 
   239	       run OS/2 and Windows (albeit sluggishly) but also run earlier 
   240	       software programs at greater speeds. AT class machines are 
   241	       considered a "plain vanilla" standard in most office environments 
   242	       and are usually sold with hard drives and additional memory as 
   243	       standard equipment. 
   244	       
   245	       The 80286 processor also operates in two modes which the 8088 
   246	       and 8086 cannot: REAL MODE which allows the 80286 CPU to work 
   247	       like an 8088 CPU and PROTECTED MODE which allows access to more 
   248	       RAM memory. In theory, the older 8088 CPU chip can address up to 
   249	       1 Megabyte of memory. An 8088 CPU always operates in real mode. 
   250	       
   251	       In protected mode, however, the 80286 CPU can use up to 16 
   252	       Megabytes of memory which can be an advantage in running both 
   253	       larger, more sophisticated programs as well as earlier programs. 
   254	       In addition, the 80286 CPU can, with the proper software, run 
   255	       several programs simultaneously which is know as MULTITASKING. 
   256	       
   257	       The benefits of both protected mode and multitasking are 
   258	       somewhat unrealized at present although certain of these 
   259	       benefits can be obtained when running Windows software rather 
   260	       than DOS. Because of this, most users who continue to run DOS 
   261	       use an 80286 computer as a FAST device rather than seeking the 
   262	       advantages of multitasking or protected mode operation. And the 
   263	       80286 is VERY fast indeed with some manufacturers pushing the 
   264	       CPU to speeds of 25 Mhz. 
   265	
   266	       Generally, adding additional upgrade equipment such as EGA 
   267	       monitors and laser printers is a good investment with an AT 
   268	       machine but a poor idea with an XT machine. The AT machine uses 
   269	       a 16 bit bus structure for rapid data flow while the older XT 
   270	       class machine uses a more primitive 8 bit bus. 
   271	       
   272	       AT class machines run graphics and CAD programs relatively 
   273	       quickly. Hard drives operate quickly on an AT class machine with 
   274	       its larger 16 bit bus. It is a good choice for the small home 
   275	       office doing word processing, accounting, light desktop 
   276	       publishing, medium sized database mailing lists and so forth. 
   277	
   278	       Still higher up the food chain are 80386 and 80386SX CPU 
   279	       equipped machines which are still faster and provide a few more 
   280	       whistles and bells. They can run software which XT and AT class 
   281	       machines run, only FASTER. They are the machines of choice for 
   282	       office LAN networks, intensive graphics, CAD programming, 
   283	       Windows, OS/2, compilers and other number intensive programs. 
   284	       
   285	       Curiously, though, the 80386 data bus remains 16 bits wide in 
   286	       most of these machines and there is no "OS/3" operating system, 
   287	       so the performance you derive is speed without additional 
   288	       whistles and bells. For most users, a "386" machine is mostly an 
   289	       office computer which a home or hobby user might admire but 
   290	       rarely need. 
   291	       
   292	       Intel corrected the problem of switching from real mode to 
   293	       protected mode - a design flaw of the 80286 - and added a third 
   294	       mode called virtual mode which allows the CPU to act as if 
   295	       several "separate" 8088 computers are all running within one 
   296	       machine. In addition the 80386 chip is a true 32 bit CPU which 
   297	       processes four bytes or characters at a time. This 32 bit 
   298	       structure effectively makes the 80386 CPU twice as fast as the 
   299	       80286 CPU. Finally, the 80386 can directly address a whopping 
   300	       four gigabytes of memory if available which is 256 times larger 
   301	       than the amount of memory the 80286 can address! The downside is 
   302	       that many of these advantages cannot be realized when running 
   303	       DOS. Windows or OS/2 operating systems provide access to these 
   304	       advanced features. Speed and additional memory capability is the 
   305	       primary byproduct of operating an 80386 within a DOS environment. 
   306	       
   307	       The 80386SX is an affordable variant of the 80386 CPU. The key 
   308	       difference is that it uses an EXTERNAL 16 bit data bus outside 
   309	       the CPU which is similar to that used on conventional 80286 or 
   310	       AT class computers. Internally it is quite similar to its big 
   311	       brother, the 80386, and offers similar multitasking modes and 
   312	       memory addressing. It can run all of the software the 80386 
   313	       machine can, albeit slightly more slowly. These design 
   314	       compromises allow manufacturers to produce an affordable 
   315	       computer with a good balance of speed and cost. For many users 
   316	       needing a powerful computer which can run all current and most 
   317	       future software, the 80386SX is an enviable balance of 
   318	       performance versus price and offers superior memory management, 
   319	       optimum speed and ability to run current and future software. 
   320	       
   321	       The primary reason to select a 80386 over the 80386SX involves 
   322	       the need for higher speed processing, ability to run 32-bit 
   323	       software and advanced multitasking. 
   324	
   325	       Before introducing the fourth Intel CPU, the 80486, two new 
   326	       concepts must be mentioned: memory caching and mathcoprocessing. 
   327	
   328	       As the speed of the CPU becomes faster, the RAM memory chips 
   329	       where data is stored have difficulty moving data into and out of 
   330	       the CPU. Memory caching involves special high speed RAM memory 
   331	       chips - typically an amount from 64K to 128K - in addition to 
   332	       the normal memory chips within the computer. These high speed 
   333	       chips are expensive but keep data poised to quickly move in and 
   334	       out of the CPU. Memory caching should not be confused with disk 
   335	       caching which is another concept used when discussing hard 
   336	       drives. 
   337	
   338	       A second way to increase performance is to install a math 
   339	       coprocessor chip into the empty socket which is available on 
   340	       most computers. This device shares the processing of specific 
   341	       numeric operations which can slow the CPU. Only certain types of 
   342	       software support math coprocessors such as some CAD, spreadsheet 
   343	       and graphics software. Not all software benefits from the use of 
   344	       a math coprocessor.
   345	
   346	       The 80486 CPU combines the features of the 80386 chip plus the 
   347	       addition of a self-contained on-chip coprocessor and memory 
   348	       cache. Although the memory cache is small, a mere 8K, it is 
   349	       extremely effective since it is onboard with the CPU itself. The 
   350	       80486 is useful for advanced scientific applications, CAD 
   351	       drafting, graphics and high speed LAN (local area network) 
   352	       shared computers in an office environment. 
   353	
   354	       An 80486SX CPU is also available which is essentially a "poor 
   355	       man's" 80486 with a smaller external data bus.             
   356	       
   357	       Back to CPU clock speed. Older XT (8088 CPU) machines operate at 
   358	       a relatively slow speed of 4.7 to 10.0 Mhz or Megahertz. One 
   359	       Megahertz equals one million cycles of electricity per second. 
   360	       
   361	       AT class machines (80286 CPU) operate in regions of 10 to 25 Mhz 
   362	       while 80386 and 80486 machines operate at speeds in the 20 to 
   363	       40Mhz region. Obviously faster is better especially when it 
   364	       comes to colorful graphics displays, CAD drafting, large 
   365	       spreadsheets and massive programming tasks. However simple word 
   366	       processing, small business accounting and routine mailing list 
   367	       management is more than adequate at 4.7 Mhz. The need for speed 
   368	       is relative to the computing task at hand! 
   369	
   370	       Let's backtrack for a moment and discuss RAM memory. Most 
   371	       computers are sold with a specific amount of memory installed on 
   372	       the main "motherboard". Increments of 640K to 1Meg of memory are 
   373	       common. It is commonly advertised that additional memory may be 
   374	       added as "expandable on the motherboard" to some upper limit 
   375	       such as 4Meg or 8Meg. Thus the user can easily install plug in 
   376	       chips of SIMM's (single inline memory modules) to sockets on the 
   377	       motherboard. If possible, insist on SIMM memory modules which 
   378	       are simpler for the average user to install rather than earlier 
   379	       DRAM chips. Additional plug in memory boards can also be 
   380	       installed into computers having an 80286 or higher CPU. Up to 16 
   381	       Meg of RAM memory is possible on 80286 CPU equipped computers. 
   382	
   383	       Why install more memory beyond the 640K which DOS can address?
   384	       For fast memory caching, RAM disks, TSR installations, access 
   385	       to programs which can use either or both expanded or extended 
   386	       memory, to run the Windows operating system or OS/2. These 
   387	       software requirements are not terribly exotic - but are simply 
   388	       ways to improve performance and speed for more experienced 
   389	       computer users.
   390	
   391	       The hard disk is also a consideration in any computer purchase.
   392	       CPU speed is determined by the clock speed of the computer while 
   393	       hard drive speed is determined by two factors: access speed and 
   394	       drive type. 
   395	       
   396	       Extremely fast hard drives operate at 18 milliseconds access 
   397	       time or faster. Bargain computer hard drives operates in the 
   398	       range of 28 to 40 milliseconds. Hard drives must also be mated 
   399	       to a controller circuit which offers its own blend of 
   400	       performance and economy. MFM and RLL drive/controller 
   401	       combinations are earlier and less expensive hard drives while 
   402	       ESDI, IDE and SCSI drives are faster and more expensive high 
   403	       performance options. 
   404	
   405	       Floppy drives come is various configurations. Budget computers 
   406	       may contain only a 1.2MB floppy drive and hard drive. This 
   407	       configuration can read two floppy densities: 1.2MB and 360K 
   408	       floppies. A more flexible computer contains a hard drive, 1.2MB 
   409	       floppy and 1.44MB floppy. This computer can read four floppy 
   410	       formats: 1.2MM, 1.44MB, 720K and 360K. Ask if a budget computer 
   411	       can later be upgraded to include other drive configurations. The 
   412	       new smaller drives housing the rigid "mini floppies" such as 
   413	       the 1.44MB and 720K formats hold 20% to 50% more data in a 
   414	       sturdy plastic case with spring loaded dust door. 
   415	
   416	       Monochrome displays are suitable for low end word processing but 
   417	       today's software usually requires VGA color resolution as a 
   418	       minimum. An affordable option is a VGA video card and a 
   419	       MONOCHROME (black and white) VGA monitor which provides an 
   420	       acceptable 64 shades of gray with most modern software 
   421	       applications. 
   422	
   423	       Several sources of computer equipment are available - each with 
   424	       a different flavor.
   425	
   426	       1) Manufacturer direct or direct sales, such as Dell, Northgate 
   427	       and Zeos. This method usually assures relatively high quality 
   428	       at fairly attractive price savings since you are dealing 
   429	       directly with those who design and manufacture the computer. 
   430	       Service is usually good, via telephone, FAX and BBS. The 
   431	       downside is that you must deal through the mail and await 
   432	       delivery. Price is very attractive, but not necessarily the 
   433	       lowest available.
   434	
   435	       2) Retail vendors such as Computerland or Tandy. Convenience is 
   436	       the factor here since service, returns and delivery is handled 
   437	       locally. You pay slightly higher for this additional 
   438	       convenience. Generally this is the most expensive computer 
   439	       purchase option.
   440	
   441	       3) Mail Order Houses. Almost 15 percent of PC sales are 
   442	       conducted by mail. Mail order houses do not completely design 
   443	       and build their own systems like direct sellers but rely on 
   444	       imported and pre-manufactured assemblies. Technical phone 
   445	       support can be variable, but if you shop carefully, you can save 
   446	       even more over local retail or manufacturer direct channels. 
   447	       Mail order sources are available in newsstand magazines such as 
   448	       Computer Shopper and PC Sources. 
   449	
   450	       4) VAR's or Resellers. These specialized vendors usually provide 
   451	       systems in volume frequently with "value added" features such as 
   452	       special software setup, training or unique customization of 
   453	       computer systems. 
   454	
   455	       5) Home brewers. The ready availability of computer components 
   456	       has spawned a cottage industry of small shops, some in home or 
   457	       low rent office spaces which can custom design a system or allow 
   458	       you to build your own computer using parts and facilities which 
   459	       they provide. These small, minimum overhead operations can 
   460	       provide extremely low prices but guarantees and service 
   461	       contracts should be provided in writing and background of the 
   462	       vendor should be investigated carefully. 
   463	      
   464	       What are some questions and requirements in purchasing a system? 
   465	 
   466	       What speeds are available on the CPU? 10 Mhz is standard on XT's 
   467	       with 12 to 20 Mhz on AT's and 33 mhz on 80386 machines. How many 
   468	       free slots are available on the internal motherboard for 
   469	       expansion with future upgrade circuits? Five to eight expansion 
   470	       slots is desirable except on small laptop computers. Is there 
   471	       both a serial and parallel port? How many of each? Mouse port? 
   472	       Is a clock chip included? How big is the hard drive? 40  to 80 
   473	       Meg is considered somewhat standard in size today for most hard 
   474	       drives although smaller 20 meg hard drives are useful for light 
   475	       office use computers. 
   476	    
   477	       How many bays are available for extra drives? Two is minimum. 
   478	       How many floppies? What size of floppies? Most computers today 
   479	       minimally have either two floppies OR one floppy and one hard 
   480	       drive. Who makes the hard drive? Seagate, Connor and Miniscribe 
   481	       are considered reasonable, although not exclusive choices. Who 
   482	       makes the floppy drive? Teac, Panasonic, Sony and Toshiba are 
   483	       considered reputable in floppy manufacture. 
   484	       
   485	       Whose BIOS chip powers the machine? Phoenix, Award and AMI Bios 
   486	       chips are all fine. How much memory is installed on the 
   487	       motherboard. 640K is a bare minimum for all machines with 80286 
   488	       and 80386 machines usually offered with at least two to four 
   489	       Megs of RAM memory. Any memory cache chips? Any coprocessor 
   490	       installed? Coprocessor socket available?
   491	
   492	       What warranty covers the product and for how long? Does the 
   493	       warranty cover both parts and labor? Does the vendor have 
   494	       sufficient inventory to replace the entire computer if problems 
   495	       arise? Is there a different warranty for the printer? Who 
   496	       provides the service? What is the vendor's return policy AND 
   497	       refund policy. Is there a restocking charge? Is there a discount 
   498	       or change in price when dealing by check or charge card? How 
   499	       long has the vendor been in business? Is the warranty 90 days, 
   500	       one year or two years as some manufacturers are now offering? 
   501	       Money back guarantee? How long? 30, 60, 90 days? What type of 
   502	       refund on this guarantee: store credit, cash, exchange? Will you 
   503	       put it in writing? Shipping and handling fee? Visa card 
   504	       surcharge? 
   505	       
   506	       How good is technical support? Is there a toll-free support 
   507	       line? 24 hours or limited hours? Is there a BBS (modem) 
   508	       telephone line for support?
   509	
   510	       Is maintenance performed on site (the customer's location) or 
   511	       only at the vendor's location? Response time? Special 
   512	       conditions? Is the on-site service essentially the same in 
   513	       terms, such as parts and labor, as off-site? 
   514	
   515	       Has the vendor sold computers to buyers in your business 
   516	       specialty (medical, for example). References? How long has the 
   517	       vendor been in business? 
   518	
   519	       What is the estimated life of the PC? Of the hard drive? How far 
   520	       can it be upgraded? In RAM memory? How many expansion slots?
   521	       Can the CPU be upgraded? The display and graphics card? What is 
   522	       the MTBF or mean time between failure of the components such as 
   523	       the hard drive and printer according to printed manufacturer's 
   524	       literature?  
   525	
   526	       Does the computer come with ALL the parts you will need such as 
   527	       monitor and graphics card? On many bare bones systems this is 
   528	       extra. 
   529	       
   530	       Are the accessories from the same manufacturer? Is the item 
   531	       available for immediate shipment or is a backorder the option of 
   532	       the moment? When will it be shipped? Has there been a recent 
   533	       price increase? 
   534	              
   535	       Any financing options available from the vendor which offer 
   536	       advantage over bank or credit card purchase? Leasing options? 
   537	       Bank financing carried by the vendor? What bank?
   538	 
   539	       Extras included with purchase? Documentation? DOS software? What 
   540	       version? DOS 5.0 is the latest. Mouse? Software installed on the 
   541	       hard drive? Is it legal software? Is is commercial software? 
   542	       Shareware? 
   543	
   544	       Any training classes provided? When? How often. Brush up 
   545	       training free? 
   546	  
   547	       What utilities and extra software comes with the machine? Any 
   548	       hard drive menu systems or utility software? How is the 
   549	       documentation? Really good or just whatever the manufacturer had 
   550	       translated? 
   551	
   552	       What display monitor and card are included (if any)? VGA is 
   553	       standard. EGA is minimum. CGA and Hercules are the bare minimum. 
   554	       Are printer cables included with purchase of the printer? Any 
   555	       spare printer ink cartridges included? 
   556	
   557	       How is the keyboard. Springy and clicky with a tactile feel or 
   558	       just mushy and so so? 
   559	       
   560	       Is the Basic programming language included or is this an extra 
   561	       cost. Will the manufacturer throw in a software package suitable 
   562	       for beginners such as Microsoft Works? Is the machine FCC class 
   563	       B certified (the best) or class A (acceptable)? What is the 
   564	       interleave on the hard drive (1:1 is fastest)? Is the keyboard 
   565	       an 84 key type or 101 key type? 
   566	
   567	       Is the computer case metal or plastic? How hard or easy is it to 
   568	       pop the cover and install new circuit cards? Does the keyboard 
   569	       plug into the front or back of the machine? The front plug 
   570	       option is a sometimes more handy. Is the reset and on/off switch 
   571	       on the front, back or side of the machine? Front is again more 
   572	       handy. Panel lights on the machine to indicate CPU speed and 
   573	       hard drive use? Keylock for security? How many copies of the 
   574	       key? Does your key fit all the computers in the store too?
   575	       
   576	       Does a local computer club/user group buy from the vendor which 
   577	       might provide personal references who can discuss why they 
   578	       bought from that vendor? 
   579	
   580	       For those who wish to read published reviews concerning specific 
   581	       brands of computers, printers, monitors, modems and software: 
   582	       the most complete resource is PC Magazine published by Ziff-
   583	       Davis and available at most libraries and many newsstands. PC 
   584	       Magazine editors usually select one or two items within a 
   585	       product classification as their "Editors Choice." The complete 
   586	       index to both PC Magazine as well as their product review index 
   587	       is contained in their on-line modem service PC MagNet. 
   588	       Instructions for reaching PC Magnet by modem are contained in 
   589	       the Utilities section included within each issue of PC Magazine. 
   590	
   591	       For product reviews of hardware and software you may wish to 
   592	       download the PC MagNet files PCM.EXE, PCSRCH.EXE and PCM.INF 
   593	       which are quite large. The files occupy more than 2 Megabytes of 
   594	       disk space and require about 1.5 hours of somewhat expensive 
   595	       modem connect time. Alternatively, you can reach the same 
   596	       index of products on line within PC MagNet by typing GO REVIEWS 
   597	       which allows you to search the product review database directly. 
   598	       A larger database of 130 periodicals and their respective 
   599	       product reviews can be viewed by typing GO COMPLIB from within 
   600	       PC MagNet. Additional product review sources are suggested on 
   601	       page 27 of the June 26, 1990 issue of PC Magazine (Vol 9 No 12.) 
   602	       Page 397 of the same issue contains instructions on reaching and 
   603	       using PC MagNet by modem. 
   604	
   605	       If you do not have a modem or a friend with that capability, a 
   606	       low-tech method for reviewing specific computer hardware and 
   607	       software recommendations is to visit a local library which 
   608	       contains back issues of PC Magazine. Glance at the magazine 
   609	       cover for highlights of products reviewed in that issue. If you 
   610	       work your way from the current issue backwards in time for 6 to 
   611	       12 months, you should find detailed reviews on the equipment you 
   612	       are investigating. Many computer clubs maintain a library of PC 
   613	       Magazine issues and may be a source if your local library does 
   614	       not subscribe to the magazine. 
   615	
   616	       Yet another way to constructively shop for computer equipment is 
   617	       to obtain free catalogs which are provided at no charge by 
   618	       reputable computer vendors and manufacturers. See the listing of 
   619	       free equipment catalogs contained in the recommended 
   620	       reading/bibliography section elsewhere on this disk.

   626	       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
   627	
   628	       1) Does the computer contain sufficient RAM memory and CPU speed 
   629	       for the applications you intend to run and how easy is it to add 
   630	       more memory? A 80286 computer may be fine for word processing, 
   631	       for example, but a poor choice for extensive desktop publishing.
   632	
   633	       2) Is the computer FCC approved with an FCC sticker? Class A or 
   634	       B? Class B is better since it means certified for home use and 
   635	       theoretically emits less objectionable static radiation.
   636	
   637	       3) Have you identified the software you will (or might) be 
   638	       using? Can the machine run that software? Is DOS included with 
   639	       your machine? 
   640	
   641	       4) As your needs change in time, will the machine expand or 
   642	       change with those needs? 
   643	
   644	       5) Is the outer case of the computer large enough to accommodate 
   645	       additional expansion circuit boards? How many? 
   646	
   647	       6) Is the power supply sufficiently large for future expansion? 
   648	       What is the wattage of the power supply? Is the fan noise low or 
   649	       NERVE WRACKING? 
   650	
   651	       7) How many and what kind of floppy drives do you need? 
   652	
   653	       8) Is the hard disk (if the machine contains one) certified for 
   654	       use with the internal controller board which operates it? What 
   655	       make on the controller card and hard drive?
   656	
   657	       9) Is the hard disk set with the correct interleave factor? 
   658	
   659	       10) Will your dealer offer superior service after the sale? Who 
   660	       does the service? Where? Any free training classes? 
   661	
   662	       11) Are all warranties in writing and how do they compare to 
   663	       other dealers warranties in writing?
   664	
   665	       12) What kind of monitor will you need and does the video 
   666	       adapter card inside the computer allow for monitor upgrades and 
   667	       will it display the software you intend to use? 
   668	
   669	       13) Are you buying the computer or a sales pitch? 
   670	
   671	       14) Are the internal components industry standard? Especially 
   672	       the floppy and hard drives. What brands? 
   673	
   674	       15) Is the dealer trying to sell you more/less than you need? 
   675	 
   676	       16) Have you set a realistic budget? 
   677	
   678	       17) Have you gathered information for all sources such as 
   679	       friends, magazine reviews, stores and advertisements? Are you 
   680	       relying on one computer guru from work or, more wisely, several? 
   681	
   682	       18) If the price is far below the average, something is missing.
   683	       What is it? Quality of the hard drive, lack of higher resolution 
   684	       video, toll free telephone support, software such as DOS?
   685	
   686	       19) Determine the REAL price by extracting hidden additional 
   687	       shipping charges, credit card surcharges, restocking charge if 
   688	       item returned. 
   689	       
   690	       20) Pay by credit card if possible since if you end in dispute, 
   691	       your credit card company can go to bat for you and issue a 
   692	       credit until the dispute is resolved. In addition, many credit 
   693	       cards automatically double the manufacturer's warranty. 
   694	
   695	       21) Get details in writing. What is the salesperson's name? What 
   696	       is the exact shipping date? 24 hours? same day? Get it in 
   697	       writing via FAX. Retain the ORIGINAL AD which promoted the 
   698	       computer. A paper trail established early is the best 
   699	       protection. Retain warranty cards long enough to test all 
   700	       equipment functions first! If you mail in manufacturer's 
   701	       warranty cards too quickly, you may have to settle for 
   702	       warranty coverage rather than replacement by the vendor.
   703	
   704	       22) Retain all original cartons and packing material. Many 
   705	       vendors ABSOLUTELY require it in case of return!
   706

   708	       
   709	            MUSCLE FOR COMPUTER CONSUMERS - THE LONG ARM OF THE LAW 
   710	       
   711	       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
   712	
   713	       If you are dealing with a mail order supplier, Federal Trade 
   714	       Commission rules apply! Essentially the vendor must ship the 
   715	       order within 30 days of receiving it unless the advertisement 
   716	       states otherwise. If a delay will be experienced in shipment, 
   717	       the vendor must notify you in writing of a definite new shipment 
   718	       date and also offer you the chance to cancel the order with full 
   719	       refund. That notice must include a stamped or self-addressed 
   720	       envelope or card which allows you to indicate your choice. If 
   721	       you do not respond, the seller may rightfully assume you accept 
   722	       the delay. However, the vendor must either ship or cancel the 
   723	       original order within 30 days after the original shipping date 
   724	       which was promised. 
   725	
   726	       Any refunds for order cancellation must be made promptly. Even 
   727	       if you accept an indefinite delay, you have the right to cancel 
   728	       the original order at any time before the item is shipped. If 
   729	       you chose to cancel any order, which has been paid by check or 
   730	       money order, the vendor must mail a refund within seven business 
   731	       days excluding weekends and holidays. 
   732	       
   733	       Likewise if the order was paid for by credit card, the vendor 
   734	       must credit your account within one business cycle following 
   735	       your cancellation request. Store credits and other methods or 
   736	       offers of similar merchandise are NOT acceptable unless you 
   737	       agree. If the original item is not available, a substitute item, 
   738	       even if similar, is not acceptable unless the vendor has your 
   739	       consent. Report violations to the Federal Trade Commission whose 
   740	       phone number is usually listed in the blue pages (government 
   741	       section) of your local telephone book. Tell the vendor you are 
   742	       reporting violations to the FTC and mail the vendor a copy of 
   743	       the letter you wrote to the FTC. This usually brings action 
   744	       quickly.
   745	
   746	       One primary conduit for recourse is the Direct Marketing 
   747	       Association which maintains an action line for problem 
   748	       resolution. First you should attempt to deal directly with the 
   749	       seller, but if a problem is not promptly resolved you may wish 
   750	       to contact the Mail Order Action Line, c/o DMA, 6 East 43rd 
   751	       Street, NY, NY 10017. 
   752	       
   753	       The first step in any attempt to seek redress from a vendor is 
   754	       to notify the supplier in writing that the item is defective 
   755	       and include a copy of the invoice with information as to model, 
   756	       price, date of order and account number if available. Retain a 
   757	       copy of your letter seeking refund or replacement. Any phone 
   758	       calls should be followed by a letter. 
   759	       
   760	       Generally do not return the item to the vendor until told how 
   761	       and when to do so, since many have formal return policies and 
   762	       require "return authorization numbers" which are usually issued 
   763	       to you by phone or in writing. The return authorization number 
   764	       accompanies the defective item on its return. Keep a copy of the 
   765	       shipping receipt and packing slip. Any rights to recover postal 
   766	       or shipping costs is determined by the policy of that vendor as 
   767	       is usually stated in advertising and product literature. 
   768	
   769	       You may also consider contacting the attorney general for the 
   770	       state in which you live as well as the state in which the vendor 
   771	       does business. This can be MOST effective especially if you send 
   772	       a copy of that letter to the vendor. If the product was paid for 
   773	       with a credit card, you may also retain the right to withhold 
   774	       payment or cancel payment which is usually arranged directly 
   775	       with your bank or credit card issuing agency. This is explained 
   776	       under provisions of the Federal Fair Credit Billing Act.
