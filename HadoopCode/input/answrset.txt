     1	NetWorld '92, Boston -- February 10, 1992 -- Today, AnswerSet Corporation
     2	announced several enhancements to Version 2 of Clientele, the company's
     3	top-selling support automation system designed specifically for managing
     4	customer support departments and internal help desks. This enhanced
     5	version includes: a variety of new reports, the assignment of default
     6	values to fields, copying of custom field information, and the archival or
     7	deletion of volume events including calls, shipments and feedback.
     8	Additionally, the audit function for calls is improved, and hooks for call
     9	escalation are added. Version 2.1 will be available in March of this
    10	year.
    11	
    12	In addition to tracking call data, Clientele includes a powerful,
    13	integrated Answerbook. This function captures call data and assigns it any
    14	number of keywords, making critical information instantly available to all
    15	support representatives. Customers are guaranteed quick, consistent, and
    16	accurate responses. Support managers are guaranteed improved performance
    17	of their departments.
    18	
    19	Clientele is a multi-user application that runs on networked IBM-compatible
    20	personal computers. It uses the latest database technology to maintain and
    21	track basic customer information, call records, computer configurations,
    22	service agreements and follow-ups. Using this software, support personnel
    23	create a central database of common customer data that can be shared with
    24	other departments, such as sales and marketing.
    25	
    26	Clientele's installed base includes companies that provide a high level of
    27	support to customers and employees. The product is used with equal success
    28	in Fortune 500 firms and young, emerging companies. Major customers
    29	include Digital Equipment Corporation, EDS (a division of General Motors),
    30	cc:Mail (a division of Lotus); MECA Software; and Walt Disney
    31	Imagineering.
    32	
    33	Clientele captures customer feedback
    34	
    35	ExperVision, a leading developer of optical character recognition software,
    36	uses Clientele to manage technical questions and customer feedback. Bob
    37	Gibson, Manager of Technical Support, states: "Most of the support
    38	products we evaluated had cluttered user interfaces. However, Clientele
    39	has a very clean user interface. This allows our support representatives
    40	to get into and out of the database very efficiently. They spend less time
    41	handling the data entry and more time handling additional customers.
    42	
    43	Customer opinion is very important to us. Using Clientele, our support
    44	staff captures technical questions and critical feedback from our
    45	customers. This feedback communicates to development, marketing, and sales
    46	actual customer commentary and gives us the input required for further
    47	strategic direction of our company. Without Clientele, we could not
    48	respond as quickly to the competitive marketplace we serve."
    49	
    50	Managers can customize Clientele's input screens and field names to meet
    51	their department's specific needs. The product includes many modifiable
    52	standard reports and a sophisticated, easy-to-use report writer for
    53	generating custom reports.
    54	
    55	Clientele's unique design provides intuitive access to any screen with
    56	minimal keystrokes. Pull-down menus and context-sensitive help make the
    57	program easy to learn and use.
    58	
    59	Availability and support
    60	
    61	Clientele's pricing ranges from $5,995 for a five-user system to $16,995
    62	for 25 users. This pricing includes support for the first year. The
    63	support plan guarantees receipt of future product enhancements and
