     2	 An Introduction to Virtual Reality
     3	
     4		As computing moves into the '90s, more and more attention is being 
     5	given to the subject of user interfaces. The interest in the idea of graphic 
     6	user interfaces clearly indicates that people are looking for ways to work 
     7	with their machines that are more direct and intuitive. The past year has 
     8	seen a rise in the number of computer hardware and software producers getting 
     9	into the fray with was has become known as "multimedia", the integration of 
    10	sound and visuals with large-scale memory in the form of optical CD-ROM 
    11	drives. But what lies just around the corner is a quantum leap in thinking 
    12	about how humans and computers interact, and the fact is, it isn't just 
    13	around the corner. In a way, it's here already.
    14		
    15		Virtual Reality is a term that has been coined to describe the
    16	concept of immersing the user IN data, rather than just looking at a screen 
    17	and typing, or using a pointer device such as a mouse or trackball. The idea 
    18	of "creating worlds" on a personal computer is not entirely new. Most of you
    19	reading this file probably have a game or two on your hard disk that
    20	simulates a world of some sort, a flight simulator perhaps, maybe a driving/ 
    21	auto racing simulator, a space exploration and combat game, even something as
    22	simple as a chess game that gives you a 3d perspective on a "virtual" 
    23	chessboard.
    24	
    25		Those of you reading this as a result of being in Compuserves
    26	graphics forums already obviously have an interest in creating images that
    27	create a visual environment electronically, whether that interest is geared
    28	toward realistic landscapes in raytracing, or very abstract imagery such as 
    29	can be created using fractals, raytracing, paint programs and image 
    30	processors. The topic here is, how can one take that sort of exploration and 
    31	move it to a new level, where you are so thoroughly immersed in the image 
    32	that it, for the moment, IS reality! The final step is to take that notion 
    33	and add dynamics, animation which moves us into four dimensions; height, 
    34	width, depth, and time.
    35	
    36		Much work is being done right now in this new computer discipline, 
    37	much work has already been done. Soon, no doubt, work that has been strictly 
    38	the domain of military research, university study, and private enterprise R&D 
    39	programs will begin to see the light of day. Already, virtual reality systems 
    40	are being used for things like modeling molecular structures in chemical 
    41	research, architectural modeling, aerodynamics, and (no suprise here) flight 
    42	training.
    43	
    44		The earliest commercial applications of virtual reality technology 
    45	will almost certainly emerge first in two widely differing fields: games, and 
    46	computer aided design. Work is going on at the University of North Carolina, 
    47	NASA, Autodesk, MIT's Media Lab, and many other places, including many 
    48	companies started for the sole purpose of developing this new field.
    49	
    50		What will go on in this section? Since we are, after all, in the 
    51	computer art forum, it may already be apparent. As personal computers evolve 
    52	in leaps and bounds, things that seemed like pure science fiction 15 years 
    53	ago, as the concept of personal computers was first taking shape, are now 
    54	real. In the form of Fractint, we have available a program allowing the 
    55	exploration of the world of mathematics turned into art. Also we have the DKB 
    56	raytracer developed by David Buck, which is developing into a new version 
    57	being done as a collaboration among CIS users, much as Fractint is continually 
    58	being developed. The possibility exists that work of a similar type is 
    59	possible when this sort of talent and interest is brought to bear on this new 
    60	field. For example, there is C source code available for interfacing a Mattel 
    61	Power Glove to IBM-compatible PCs through an RS-232 port. More is needed in 
    62	the area of hardware to make the world of virtual reality accessible to PC 
    63	users. For example, what about a head-mounted display, using miniature 
    64	displays such as those used in pocket-size television sets, in a binocular 
    65	configuration?
    66	
    67		Once hardware is available, software is needed. Anybody out there 
    68	with game design experience would be helpful in creating a dynamic environment 
    69	for virtual reality. Those interested in animation may have much to offer.
    70	The principles involved in fractals and raytracing can be applied to this new 
    71	field to some extent, and the sort of creative spirit and collaborative 
    72	efforts present elsewhere in the graphics forums can certainly make progress 
    73	in this! Anything at all that makes progress into this area is welcome!
    74	
    75		If you don't have the ability to make technical contributions, you 
    76	may be able to offer a great deal anyway. In such new territory, there is 
    77	always a need for those who have imagination, vision, a sense of direction 
    78	and purpose for new technology. If you have a suggestion, fire off a message! 
    79	Somebody out there may have the ability and means to make what may seem 
    80	outlandish on the surface into reality.   
    81		
    82		If you have ideas that are too extensive to fit into a short message,
    83	by all means, crank up the word processor and write it up, and upload it. 
    84	This is all fairly new stuff, and things are wide open. Virtual Reality truly 
    85	is the new frontier of computing, all hype aside. It WILL change the face of 
    86	computing profoundly. The key word is not IF, but WHEN. It may seem, in the 
    87	era of VLSI chip technology and multinational electronics corporations, to be 
    88	impossible for basement experimenters and hobbyists to make advances in 
    89	computers. In some sense that may be true. However, it is worth noting that 
    90	personal computers grew out of the efforts of just those sorts of people, 
    91	roughly 15 years ago. It also is very significant that many of you reading 
    92	this are not just amateurs and hobbyists, but computer professionals.
    93	
    94		This may be one of the best places possible to begin the movement of 
    95	Virtual Reality systems into the domain of truly personal computing, something 
    96	available to those without massive financial and technical resources at their 
    97	disposal. Certainly, the results possible with a 12Mhz 286 DOS-based machine 
    98	will not equal the potential of a Cray. That doesn't mean work shouldn't begin 
    99	at that level, however.
   100	
   101		It is worth reflecting on the Altair minicomputer which was made 
   102	available in kit form in the mid '70's. Unimaginably crude and weak by todays 
   103	standards, it fired the imaginations of thousands. You may well be one of 
   104	those people. One of the people who, inspired by what would be regarded today 
   105	as an ugly paperweight, went on to considerably more advanced realms. The 
   106	computer industry as it is today was largely built on the efforts of people 
   107	who realized the full ramifications of that Model T of computers. Today, 
   108	Virtual Reality stands on the beach at Kitty Hawk. It doesn't take much to 
   109	extrapolate the possible future given the advancement of technology and future 
   110	economics of computer hardware. The shop project of a pair of bicycle 
   111	mechanics eventually became the 747, F16, the Learjet. The Altair eventually 
   112	led to things like 386 and 486 based machines with 1024x768 displays capable 
   113	of 256 colors, and more with video boards like the Targa; the Macintosh IIci, 
   114	the Next and Sun workstations.
   115	
   116		Work done now, at this level, can have a major effect on the course 
   117	of development of VR. Not to mention the fact that it could be great fun!
   118		
   119		In electronics today, much thought needs to be given to the ideas of
   120	how standards evolve. What determines what form a medium takes can be 
   121	influenced heavily by the thoughts and actions of the people most interested 
   122	in using the technology. Things aren't simply handed down from ivory towers 
   123	in corporations. Work done here, in a public forum, may well have an effect 
   124	on the future shape of virtual reality at a home-user level. The fact is, a 
   125	lot of "major players" are getting involved, or are already involved, in VR 
   126	work; but there are different levels to technology, and while a lot of the 
   127	focus of VR work is devoted to things like new ways to access huge amounts of 
   128	data for businesses and governments, there is also a whole new world to be 
   129	explored in terms of applications for individuals with PCs.
   130		
   131		There is a lot to think about entering the world of "cyberspace", not
   132	only hardware and software problems, but philisophical questions as well. What
   133	will we use it for? What IS it exactly? How much of reality is the human
   134	perception of it? 
   135	
   136		The questions ahead are big ones, without a doubt. Too broad to 
   137	address here. It's like asking "what can computers be used for". Major stuff. 
   138	The questions are large, but the main purpose here will be to develop
   139	hardware and software that can be used by the average DOS-based machine. In
   140	the course of such work, there no doubt will be much discussion of the 
   141	purpose of it all. This is important. We'll try to keep it all in balance, 
   142	and keep projects going, I hope. Hopefully, at some point interest and 
   143	activity will justify moving into a new forum devoted entirely to VR, with 
   144	different sections devoted to hardware and software projects and files, as 
   145	well as social and philisophical issues. It all depends on how active this 
   146	section is, and how much interest it draws.
   147	
   148		Jump right in. If you know of people who frequent other forums who 
   149	may be interested and informative, encourage them to stop by. To start things
   150	out we need dialog. I hope we can get things going here soon, and start 
   151	working to bring Virtual Reality to the average computer.
