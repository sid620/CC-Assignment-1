     5	Hey, if you use Windows 3.1, check this out:
     6	
     7	   In the Program Manager, go to the Help menu and select 'About'.
     8	You'll see the typical info window with the windows logo. Hold the Control
     9	and Shift keys and double click in the green area of the windows logo.
    10	Nothing happens? Don't release the Control-Shift keys and repeat the
    11	same step once again (About, green flag). Uhuh, something happens now!
    12	Repeat it for third time. You'll get a list of some of the programmers
    13	who wrote Windows. If you liked the trick, you can do it now with
    14	the rest of the colors (blue, red, yellow). Remember to do it 3 times
    15	for each color. You'll also get a picture of Bill Gates, another guy
    16	and a teddy bear (MS mascot). I got this from a file about Windows
    17	secrets. Nice eh?

    19	And if you knew it already, nevermind. I just found it out...

    23	In Norton Desktop For Windows... click on help, about, then press n,d,and w at
    24	the same time, and while holding them down, double click on the Symantec logo.
    25	Whoopie-Doopie! Pictures of the development team! And you can zoom and scroll
    26	on them too!
