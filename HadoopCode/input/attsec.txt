    12	AT&T INTRODUCES BREAKTHROUGH IN TELEPHONE SECURITY
    13	
    14	
    15	     GREENSBORO, N.C. (September 10, 1992) --  AT&T has brought
    16	security to the phone you use every day.
    17	
    18	     The AT&T Telephone Security Device Model 3600 provides
    19	advanced encryption technology to standard telephones, allowing
    20	businesses to discuss sensitive matters without fear that their
    21	words can be intercepted.
    22	
    23	     "The Telephone Security Device is a breakthrough in
    24	telephone communications," said Ed Hickey, AT&T Vice President
    25	for Secure Communications Systems.  "It makes your everyday phone
    26	a secure device, and it makes protecting your conversation as
    27	easy as making a regular phone call."
    28	
    29	     In showing the device to corporate clients, AT&T has
    30	received an overwhelmingly positive reaction.
    31	
    32	     "We've gotten the strongest reaction we've ever seen for a
    33	secure communications product," Hickey says.  "This is the
    34	product they've been waiting for."
    35	
    36	     The Model 3600 is compatible with both digital and analog
    37	phones.  Designed for portability and ease of use, it's slightly
    38	larger than a hand-held calculator and weighs only about 1.5
    39	pounds.  Its small size and light weight allow it to be carried
    40	in a briefcase and used in the office, at home and when travel-
    41	ling.
    42	
    43	     To use the device, simply disconnect your handset's cord
    44	from the phone and plug that cord into the Telephone Security
    45	Device.  Plug the device's line into your phone and its power
    46	cord into an outlet, and it's ready to operate.
    47	
    48	     To secure a call, simply press a button and the signal is
    49	automatically encrypted.  An easy-to-read display indicates that
    50	the call has been secured.
    51	
    52	     The Model 3600 uses an advanced encryption algorithm to turn
    53	the audio signal from your telephone handset into a digital
    54	stream of encrypted information that can be decrypted only by a
    55	Telephone Security Device attached to the phone you're calling.
    56	
    57	     AT&T Bell Laboratories also designed an advanced voice-
    58	sampling algorithm that delivers superior voice quality on secure
    59	calls, rivaling the clarity of regular phone conversations.
    60	
    61	     AT&T stands behind the Telephone Security Device with a full
    62	one-year warranty and optional extensions.
    63	
    64	     The device will be shown publicly for the first time Monday
    65	at the American Society for Industrial Security seminar in San
    66	Antonio.
    67	
    68	     The device retails for $1,195.  It is available directly
    69	from the AT&T Secure Communications Customer Service Center (1
    70	800 952-4082).
    71	
    72	     For a more detailed look at communications security, the
    73	growing risks businesses face and AT&T's role in providing secure
    74	communications to business, call David Arneke, 919 279-7680 or
    75	Bill Jones, 919 279-6511, at AT&T.

    80	COMMUNICATIONS SECURITY: A GROWING CONCERN FOR BUSINESS
    81	
    82	
    83	     GREENSBORO, N.C. (September 10, 1992) --  How big an issue
    84	is communications security for businesses?  Far bigger than most
    85	of the business community realizes.
    86	
    87	     Theft of proprietary information is estimated to cost U.S.
    88	and Canadian businesses $20 billion a year.  Some of the
    89	largest -- and most technologically sophisticated -- U.S. cor-
    90	porations have lost billions in the theft of trade secrets.
    91	
    92	     But it's not just business competitors that companies have
    93	to be concerned about.  Many nations are defining their national
    94	security as economic security, and they're putting their intel-
    95	ligence agencies into the business of industrial and economic
    96	espionage.
    97	
    98	     "And yet, our experience in the market, and every study
    99	we've seen, indicates that top executives' awareness of the
   100	problem is low to non-existent," says Ed Hickey, AT&T Vice
   101	President, Secure Communications Systems.
   102	
   103	     "Most businesses think it just won't happen to them."
   104	
   105	     The FBI reports that foreign intelligence agencies already
   106	are actively spying on businesses to collect U.S. technology and
   107	proprietary information, posing a major national security threat.
   108	
   109	French intelligence agents, for example, have stolen computer
   110	secrets from IBM and Texas Instruments.  Foreign governments have
   111	tried to steal fiber optic secrets from Corning.
   112	
   113	     "The next war will not be fought with bombs and bullets; it
   114	will be fought with bits and bytes," Hickey says.
   115	
   116	     Communications and computer systems are moving massive
   117	amounts of information more quickly and routinely, making those
   118	systems increasingly valuable to spies.  With voice, fax, data
   119	and video to choose from, businesses can communicate virtually
   120	any information in any form, even over standard phone lines.
   121	
   122	     As businesses depend on their communications systems more
   123	and more, they use them in more varied ways -- cellular phones to
   124	link mobile personnel, teleconferences and videoconferences to
   125	bring remote locations together, LANs and WANs for transmitting
   126	computer data.
   127	
   128	     Those systems are delivering ever-greater volumes of infor-
   129	mation, much of it proprietary and extremely valuable to com-
   130	petitors.
   131	
   132	     "Any company in a competitive business needs to be aware of
   133	what it's doing when it communicates sensitive information,"
   134	Hickey says.
   135	
   136	     "When you pick up the phone and talk about new-product
   137	development, strategic planning, financial transactions or any
   138	competition-sensitive matter, you need to know that your words
   139	are reaching only the people you want them to reach.
   140	
   141	     Contract negotiations, legal actions and personnel issues
   142	all require confidentiality.  And they often require discussions
   143	over the telephone.
   144	
   145	     "It's not just extraordinary occasions that require
   146	security.  How much information do you talk about on the phone
   147	every day that competitors or third parties could exploit to
   148	their advantage -- or to your disadvantage?" Hickey asks.
   149	
   150	     "The same holds true for faxes, videoconferences, data
   151	transmission and any other electronic communication.  It doesn't
   152	take much to tap a line for any of them."
   153	
   154	     Interception and penetration technology is racing side by
   155	side with advances in communications technology.  And the more
   156	powerful communications systems become, the higher the stakes
   157	rise.
   158	
   159	     But most U.S. businesses are barely aware of the risks.  And
   160	many business that are aware -- even some that have been vic-
   161	timized -- are not facing up to those risks.
   162	
   163	     "Some businesses are simply unsophisticated. They don't
   164	realize the danger they're putting themselves in by not protec-
   165	ting their sensitive communications," Hickey says.
   166	
   167	     "But many that are aware of the risks are simply practicing
   168	denial, choosing to believe that they don't need to do anything,"
   169	Hickey says.  "Some executives say their work 'isn't important
   170	enough to protect.'  Others insist that everything is all right
   171	because they haven't been victimized yet -- as far as they know.
   172	
   173	     "And, of course, some just don't think their proprietary
   174	information is important enough to protect if there's a price
   175	involved."
   176	
   177	     A wide variety of products and services already exist to
   178	protect communications systems.
   179	
   180	     Recognizing the need for businesses to protect their com-
   181	munications, AT&T began migrating the secure communications
   182	devices it provides to the government into the commercial market
   183	in 1991.  The new AT&T Telephone Security Device, which encrypts
   184	the voice signals of conventional telephones, is the latest
   185	business product that AT&T has developed.
   186	
   187	     "We designed the Telephone Security Device to meet the key
   188	demands that businesses have for secure communications," says
   189	Robin Hall, manager of commercial sales for AT&T Secure Com-
   190	munications Systems.
   191	
   192	     "It's easy to use because companies don't want complicated
   193	equipment that requires time-consuming training or procedures.
   194	
   195	     "It works with conventional phones because we've found that
   196	many companies don't want to part with the equipment they already
   197	own.
   198	
   199	     "And it's a small, portable unit that can be carried easily
   200	in a briefcase because companies that have a good awareness of
   201	security realize that secure communications are necessary
   202	everywhere they do business."
   203	
   204	     The Telephone Security Device was designed by AT&T Bell
   205	Laboratories, which developed the technology for AT&T's highly
   206	successful secure products for the U.S. government.  Bell
   207	Laboratories also developed an advanced voice-sampling algorithm
   208	to raise the secure voice quality of the device to nearly the
   209	level of toll calls.
   210	
   211	     The device joins several other secure products that AT&T has
   212	introduced to provide end-to-end protection for business com-
   213	munications.  They include:
   214	
   215	     -- The AT&T Model 4100 Secure Voice/Data Terminal, which
   216	provides secure voice and data communications in one integrated
   217	package.  It works as a full-featured telephone for voice calls
   218	and as a smart modem for data applications.
   219	
   220	     -- The AT&T Model 4100C Secure Cellular Voice/Data Terminal,
   221	which provides security wherever cellular coverage exists.
   222	
   223	     -- The AT&T Model 4100M Secure MERLIN TM Voice/Data Ter-
   224	minal,
   225	compatible with AT&T Merlin telephone systems.
   226	
   227	    -- The AT&T Model 4100V Secure Voice/Data/Video Terminal, a
   228	secure videotelephone that operates over standard telephone
   229	lines. The AT&T secure videophone provides the ultimate in
   230	authentication -- real-time, color, motion video.  It also
   231	transmits high-resolution still images, including photographs,
   232	maps, documents or virtually any other printed material.
   233	
   234	     -- The AT&T Gretacoder line of high-speed data encryptors,
   235	which protect computer transmissions of up to 2 Megabits per
   236	second.
   237	
   238	     AT&T develops and markets these products through AT&T Secure
   239	Communications Systems, a business unit headquartered in
   240	Greensboro, North Carolina.  The organization also provides
   241	secure systems engineering and integration services.  Its cus-
   242	tomers include the governments of the United States and other
   243	nations, and financial institutions and multinational cor-
   244	porations around the world.
   245	
   246	     AT&T Secure Communications Systems also develops products
   247	through two subsidiary companies highly respected in the secure
   248	communications field: AT&T Datotek, based in Dallas, Texas, which
   249	develops products for secure mobile communications; and AT&T
   250	Gretag Data Systems of Regensdorf, Switzerland, which develops
   251	high-speed data encryptors.
   252	
   253	     "There are pockets of awareness throughout the business
   254	community," Hickey says.  "Aerospace and other defense-related
   255	industries, for example, have a much higher awareness of security
   256	than most because of their work with the Department of Defense.
   257	
   258	     "The financial industry is doing better, particularly in
   259	Europe."
   260	
   261	     The State Department's Overseas Security Advisory Council, a
   262	group of major U.S. corporations, is working to develop greater
   263	awareness of the risks, particularly for businesses with
   264	operations outside the United States.
   265	
   266	     "But until business in general gets the message, immense
   267	amounts of sensitive information are at risk."
