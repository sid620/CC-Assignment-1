     1	                             SCSI CONTROLLER
     2	
     3	     This is a very preliminary doc. for a SCSI interface for the AMIGA.
     4	 I know that it is fragmented, but I am trying to get something together
     5	 quickly. Feel free to send me your comments. 
     6	 At the present time this design does not support DMA or AUTOCONFIG'ing.
     7	 The "net-list" also includes parts for an optional 2 meg. memory add-on.
     8	 At this time the memory does not work! I have to check my equations and
     9	 analize that section of the board. The memory section does NOT upset the
    10	 AMIGA or the SCSI interface. There are no special considerations when
    11	 building the board. It runs off of the AMIGA's power supply and plugs
    12	 into the EXPANSION PORT .
    13	   The board uses 1 special part: NCR53C80  (sorry about that.)
    14	 I used it because it handles most of the SCSI interface, and eliminates
    15	 alot of "LS" chips. (The NCR53C80 is the CMOS version of the SCSI
    16	 controller used by APPLE and most other venders!)
    17	
    18	    Building the board
    19	
    20	WARNING ! This board plugs into the expansion port! That port is directly
    21	connected to the CPU and other chips in your AMIGA. Care must be taken so
    22	as not to short anything to +5v or gnd as that may DESTROY your AMIGA.
    23	   The circuit and design concepts are sound, but YOU are in control of
    24	your machines destiny.  This project is NOT for the casual hacker.
    25	REMEMBER, Don't yell at me if you break your machine!!!
    26	
    27	   On the lighter side, my board worked the first time it was turned on.
    28	It must be easy if I didn't make any errors... Just take your time and all
    29	will be OK !
    30	
    31	
    32	After deciding where to locate all of the parts, use the "net-list" to
    33	wire it. I suggest doing all of the wiring to the board before installing
    34	the IC's. Remember that the NCR53C80 is sensitive to static, so be careful.
    35	Also before installing IC's it is a good practice to check the power and
    36	gruond pins on all chip sockets.

    53		CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION
    54	  The reason for the 74LS688 (8 bit comparitor) is to allow for upgrading
    55	the board for AUTOCONFIG'ing. I don't plan to do this until I get the
    56	important work done (DRAM & CLOCK). It is not hard to use this way,
    57	you have to "install" the board anyway. The advantage of AUTOCONFIG
    58	is that the AMIGA decides where in the memory the board resides.
    59	This is not a problem since it is the only board in the system.....
    60	  The PAL (Z5) is used to control the DRAM. It is not needed at this point
    61	so don"t worry about it. 
    62	The 'LS139 is used to decode addresses intofour 16K blocks.
    63		1:		$800000 is the NCR53C80
    64		2:		$801000 is the PSEUDO DMA
    65	 	3:		$802000 is for the CLOCK (not done yet)
    66		4:		$803000 is not used at this point
    67	   It may seem like alot of wasted memory but the AMIGA can only
    68	AUTOCONFIG in 64K blocks. 
    69	   The second half of the 'LS139 is used to convert the R/W signal
    70	of the 680x0 to the read & write lines used by the NCR53C80.
    71	   Z4 -the 7406 will be used as the interrupt driver. I want to
    72	use INT2* for the NCR's interrupts and INT6* for the DRQ*. DON'T
    73	install the 7406 untill the real driver is available. Your AMIGA
    74	won't like getting interrupted by the NCR53C80!
    75	   That is all there is to the SCSI interface. (Atleast for now)
    76	It is possible to add DMA capibilities to the board but lets get the 
    77	thing up and running first!
    78	 
    79	
    80	      READING THE "NET-LIST"
    81	  The schematic "AMSCSI" was made on an IBM XT using Future-Net software.
    82	I wish that someone had a good schmatic capture pgm for the AMIGA !
    83	Anyway to wire a board from the "net-list" ignore the "Path Ref" &
    84	 the "Symbol Ref" cols.

   105	
   106	    The signal (AS) should be wired from pin 74 of P1 to Z1 pin 1 and
   107	Z5 pin 6
   108	    The signal (C1) should be wired from pin 16 of P1 to Z5 pin 2
   109	
   110	  Continue this for the rest of the net list. EASY ISN'T IT.
   111	
   112	  It is recommended that the SCSI bus be terminated with 220 ohm / 330 ohm 
   113	resistors. These are not included on the "net-list". Every SCSI signal
   114	should have a 220 ohm resistor to +5v, and a 330 ohm resistor to gnd.
   115	  You might want to try it without the terminators, but leave room for them
   116	just to be safe..........
   117	
   118	  When I get a chance I will make a schematic on Dpaint.
   119	
   120	I have included two BASIC programs that will help you test your board.
   121		1: SCSIMon - 	a small monitor that constantly reads the NCR53C80
   122				and desplays the reg.s in HEX
   123		2: SCSIdvr -	a very crude program that "PEEKS & POKES" the
   124				SCSI . With it you can FORMAT, READ, & WRITE
   125				a hard disk. It takes about 10-20 sec to read,
   126				or write 1 sector !! ( Not blazing speed is it?)
   127	
   128	I hope to have an assembly (source) language program in the near future.
   129		It is called------- SCSI68K.asm
   130	If anyone can help with the DRIVER, PLEASE, let me know!
   131	
   132	    I can be reached through AMIGA/INFO BBS @ (215) 430-3969

   134	   GOOD LUCK                                      Rich Frantz
