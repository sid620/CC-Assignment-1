     1	Toronto, Ontario -- November 14, 1991-- SuperTime Inc. has announced that
     2	they are now shipping version 1.1 of their critically acclaimed groupware
     3	product, SuperTime. The new release contains added functionality in the
     4	product's sales management and telemarketing features, improved text
     5	editing capabilities, increased integration and interactivity between the
     6	various modules, easier installation/setup routines and more extensive
     7	help.
     8	
     9	Designed to automate and organize the daily activities of an entire
    10	LAN-connected office, these new enhancements have been added to
    11	SuperTime's existing Appointment Calendar/Scheduler, Contact Directories,
    12	Message Center (including complete E-Mail), Project & Task Management, DOS
    13	Shell/Menu Routines and Data Reference Libraries .
    14	
    15	SuperTime 1.1 has strengthened its sales management/telemarketing features
    16	by totally integrating the Activity List of the Contact Directory with
    17	other components of the software including To-Do items, Appointments and a
    18	new Call List that appears under the Calendar Module. The addition of an
    19	Auto-Dialer allows users to quickly and accurately make phone contact with
    20	any one of their clients from anywhere in the program.
    21	
    22	With the new text editing capabilities, that are used in all note fields in
    23	SuperTime, users can now instantly generate Quick Letters from within any
    24	contact file. Text can easily be imported and exported between the
    25	internal note fields and WordPerfect, Microsoft Word, WordStar and ASCII
    26	formats. SuperTime's text editor also now allows block cut/copy and paste
    27	and search/replace functions.
    28	
    29	The context-sensitive, hypertext Help System in SuperTime version 1.1 has
    30	been greatly expanded, virtually eliminating the need to refer to the
    31	documentation. The new version is also highlighted by its streamlined
    32	installation and setup routines that enable users to have SuperTime 1.1
    33	running on their LAN in minutes. Adding new users and resources is also
    34	faster and simpler using the default settings within version 1.1's
    35	Resource Setup.
    36	
    37	According to Gary Babcock, Product Manager for SuperTime "The biggest news
    38	of SuperTime Version 1.1 is the increased integration between the Contact
    39	Management Module and the Calendar Module. This integration is critical
    40	for people who need to manage both their time, and their activities.
    41	Because SuperTime 1.1 is a groupware product, its enhanced features will
    42	help people co-ordinate not just their activities, but also those
    43	activities in relation to everyone else's in the organization."
    44	
    45	SuperTime's Appointment Calendar has the ease of use of a written diary,
    46	yet has all the features and functionality to handle even the most complex
    47	appointment booking situations, including multi-resource group
    48	scheduling.
    49	
    50	SuperTime's Contact Directory is a comprehensive contact management system
    51	containing General, Private and Other Directories that can be completely
    52	customized to the users' requirements. During data entry, SuperTime
    53	dynamically links individual contacts to their corresponding
    54	business/organization records, and vice versa, enabling users to apply a
    55	variety of methods to instantly locate and retrieve records.
    56

    58	components. The Message Center provides complete Electronic Mail
    59	capability, an In/Out Board, a Switchboard for centralizing the generation
    60	and retrieval of phone messages, and a personal message retrieval center.

    62	Capable of organizing every facet of a large project, the Project & Task
    63	Management area provides a structured method for creating and tracking the
    64	everyday "To-Do" lists of individual users; allowing delegation,
    65	scheduling, milestone reviews, and expense detailing of tasks for all
    66	users on the system.
    67	
    68	The DOS Shell/Menu allows users to run SuperTime as a TSR, and enables
