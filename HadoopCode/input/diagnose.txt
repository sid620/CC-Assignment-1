     6	The IBM PC family of computers (PC, Portable, XT and AT) comes
     7	 complete with built-in diagnostic procedures to assist a user in
     8	 identifying many problems that may occur with any of the computer's
     9	 components.  These diagnostic procedures include:
    10	 
    11	     1.  A Power-On Self Test (POST) that is performed whenever a PC is
    12	          powered up or turned on.
    13	 
    14	     2.  General diagnostics testing that the user can perform using
    15	          the Diagnostics Diskette and accompanying Problem
    16	          Determination Procedures (PDPs) outlined in the Guide to
    17	          Operations manual for each system.
    18	 
    19	     3.  Optional advanced diagnostics testing that the user can
    20	          perform using the Advanced Diagnostics Diskette and procedures
    21	          provided in the Hardware, Maintenance and Service manual.
    22	 
    23	
    24	Power-On Self Test (POST)
    25	 
    26	Whenever you start up your computer, a series of tests are
    27	 automatically performed checking various components in your system.
    28	 This Power-On Self Test (POST) process provides error or warning
    29	 messages whenever a faulty component is encountered.  Two types of
    30	 messages are provided:  audio codes and display screen messages or
    31	 codes.
    32	 
    33	Audio codes consist of variations of sounds or beeps that identify the
    34	 faulty component.  If your computer is functioning normally, you will
    35	 hear one short beep when the system is started up.  If a problem is
    36	 detected, a different series of audio codes will be sounded.  These
    37	 audio codes and corresponding problem areas are:
    38	 
    39	
    40	     Audio Code                           Problem Area
    41	 
    42	  No beep, continuous beep, or            Power Supply
    43	    repeating short beeps
    44	 
    45	  1 long beep and 1 short beep            System Board
    46	 
    47	  l long beep and 2 short beeps, or       Monitor adapter card and/or
    48	    1 short beep and blank or               monitor cable and/or display
    49	    incorrect display
    50	 
    51	  1 short beep and either the             Drive and/or drive adapter
    52	    red drive LED staying on or             card
    53	    Personal Computer BASIC statement
    54	 
    55	On the XT and AT, the POST procedures also display system memory
    56	 as it is read.  The last number displayed (640KB, for example) should
    57	 be the total amount of memory in your system, including system board
    58	 memory and any expansion memory.
    59	 
    60	During the POST procedures, error messages or numeric codes will be
    61	 displayed whenever a problem is detected.  In most cases, the error
    62	 code will be a three or four digit number that, when checked against
    63	 the list provided in Table 1, will help identify the malfunctioning
    64	 component.
    65	 
    66	
    67	General Diagnostics Testing
    68	 
    69	Each IBM computer comes with a Guide to Operations (GTO) manual; this
    70	 is the manual in the reddish-purple binder.  The GTO includes a
    71	 Diagnostic diskette to assist you in identifying problems that your
    72	 computer may be having.
    73	 
    74	The Diagnostics diskette and corresponding Problem Determination
    75	 Procedures (PDPs) section of the GTO manual provide step-by-step
    76	 instructions to test the various parts of your computer system,
    77	 including the system unit with installed options, expansion unit,
    78	 keyboard, display, and printer.  These tests should be performed when
    79	 you first install your system, at periodic times during the lifetime of
    80	 the system for precautionary purposes, and, of course, whenever errant
    81	 behavior is detected or suspected.
    82	 
    83	To run the diagnostics tests, place a backup copy of the Diagnostics
    84	 diskette in your A: drive and turn on your system or, if the system is
    85	 already on, press the CTRL, ALT, and DEL keys simultaneously to reboot
    86	 the system.  The main diagnostics menu will be displayed with options
    87	 similar to the following:
    88	 
    89	          0 - SYSTEM CHECKOUT
    90	           1 - FORMAT DISKETTE
    91	           2 - COPY DISKETTE
    92	           3 - PREPARE SYSTEM FOR MOVING
    93	           4 - SETUP [AT only]
    94	           9 - END DIAGNOSTICS
    95	 
    96	Options 0, 1, and 2 are part of the diagnostics procedures.  Option 3,
    97	 "Prepare System For Moving", is used to "park" or secure the heads on a
    98	 hard disk so that the system unit can be safely moved without damaging
    99	 the disk or its contents; Option 4 is used with the AT to identify
   100	 installed options when you first set up your system.
   101	 
   102	Options 1 and 2 should be used whenever you want to check the operation
   103	 of your floppy diskette drives or to prepare a diskette for use,
   104	 without having to reload DOS, when performing the diagnostics
   105	 procedures.  For general testing, however, you should select Option 0,
   106	 "System Checkout".  When this option is selected, the system displays
   107	 a list of installed options for verification and then provides a
   108	 secondary menu of choices, similar to the following:
   109	 
   110	          0 - RUN TESTS ONE TIME
   111	           1 - RUN TESTS MULTIPLE TIMES
   112	           2 - LOG UTILITIES
   113	           3 - END SYSTEM CHECKOUT
   114	 
   115	Both Option 0 and 1 walk you through a series of tests that check each
   116	 component in the system.  During system testing, a three- or four-
   117	 digit error code will be generated for each component tested.  If no
   118	 problem is found, the last two digits will be 00, for example 300, 900,
   119	 or 1700.  Table 1 is a listing of many of the error codes that may be
   120	 generated during diagnostics testing.
   121	 
   122	If an error is detected when running Option 0, it is often advisable to
   123	 select the Log Utilities Option (2) to list any errors to disk or
   124	 printer, and then select Option 1, Run Tests Multiple Times.  This will
   125	 help determine whether the problem is consistent or intermittent.
   126	 
   127	While the GTO diagnostics do an excellent job at identifying specific
   128	 problem areas or problem components, they provide limited assistance to
   129	 correct the source of the errors.  In fact, the information most
   130	 frequently provided is to "Have your system unit [or problem device]
   131	 serviced".
   132	 
   133	
   134	Advanced Diagnostics Testing
   135	 
   136	If you are the more adventuresome type, you can purchase the IBM
   137	 Hardware Maintenance and Service (HMS) manual for your particular unit
   138	 (prices are around $155).  While the Guide to Operations manual is only
   139	 good for identifying a problem component, the HMS manual provides
   140	 information to both isolate and repair any failure of a "Field
   141	 Replaceable Unit (FRU)", that is, any part or component that has
   142	 interchangeable replacement parts that are stocked by IBM or the
   143	 Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).
   144	 
   145	The HMS includes an Advanced Diagnostics diskette and accompanying
   146	 Problem Isolation Codes (PICs) instructions to isolate and identify
   147	 problem components.  To run the Advanced Diagnostics tests, follow the
   148	 same procedures detailed in the previous section for General
   149	 Diagnostics testing.
   150	 
   151	The tests performed by the Advanced Diagnostics diskette are far more
   152	 detailed and precise than those of the general Diagnostics diskette in
   153	 the GTO.  In addition to identifying the problem component, the
   154	 Advanced Diagnostics further attempt to identify the specific part of
   155	 the device that is malfunctioning.
   156	 
   157	Once a problem is identified, the HMS provides detailed instructions to
   158	 perform adjustments, preventive maintenance, removal and replacement of
   159	 the effected part.  To this end, comprehensive hardware and design
   160	 information is available, including parts lists that specify
   161	 replacement parts numbers, and internal design specifications.

   168	Table 1.     Listing of IBM PC Diagnostic Error Codes
   169	 
   170	All personal computer error codes for the Power-On Self Test, general
   171	 Diagnostics, and Advanced Diagnostics are represented with the device
   172	 number followed by two digits other than 00.  The device number plus 00
   173	 indicates successful completion of the test.  This listing is a
   174	 compilation from various sources, including USENET's Info-IBMPC Digest,
   175	 IBM Technical Reference Manuals, and IBM Hardware, Maintenance and
   176	 Service manuals.
