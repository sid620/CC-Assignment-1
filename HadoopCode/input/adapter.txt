     8	The easiest way to connect your PC to a Videocrypt pay-TV decoder is to
     9	use the card slot as an interface and connect it with a voltage
    10	converter (MAX232) and a TTL open collector driver (74LS07) to the
    11	RS-232 serial port. This way, you don't even have to open the decoder
    12	and the PC can now act as a smart card.
    13	
    14	WARNING: In order to build the adapter described below, you will at
    15	         least require some basic hobby electronics experience. If
    16	         you don't understand, how the described circuitry works,
    17	         better don't use it! Although the described procedure is
    18	         relatively secure, serious errors might in the worst case
    19	         damage both your PC and your TV system.
    20	
    21	The chip cards used by the Videocrypt pay-TV system follow exactly the
    22	specification ISO 7816 (you might find this international standard in a
    23	good library, if you are interested in more details). Also, the
    24	protocol is the "asynchronous half duplex T=0 protocol" with "active
    25	low reset" and "inverse convention" as defined in this standard. The
    26	following description may also be used in order to connect computers to
    27	other ISO 7816 compatible chip card systems (e.g. GSM mobile phones or
    28	other pay-TV decoding systems) if they also use asynchronous
    29	transmission. For smart card systems which use synchronous transmission
    30	(e.g. most phone cards) the interface described here will need some
    31	modifications.
    32	
    33	According to ISO, a chip card is 85.60 mm long, 53.98 mm high, 0.76 mm
    34	thick and the edges are rounded with a radius of 3.18 mm. It has eight
    35	defined contact areas (C1 - C8 in the diagram below), each of which is
    36	at least 2 mm wide and 1.7 mm heigh:

    53	
    54	These contacts have the following purpose:
    55	
    56	
    57		C1	VCC	Supply voltage (+5 V, max. 200 mA)
    58		C2	RST	Reset signal
    59		C3	CLK	Clock signal
    60		C4	-	reserved
    61		C5	GND	Ground
    62		C6	VPP	Programming voltage (5-25 V)
    63		C7	I/O	Data input/output
    64		C8	-	reserved
    65	
    66	
    67	The following table gives the precise location of the contact areas.
    68	These areas are only minimum areas, the actual contacts might be larger
    69	but must of course be properly isolated from each other.
    70	
    71	In the following table,
    72	
    73		A	represents the maximum distance between the card's left
    74			edge and the contact area's left edge,
    75		B	represents the minimum distance between the card's left
    76			edge and the contact area's right edge,
    77		C	represents the maximum distance between the card's top
    78			edge and the contact area's upper edge,
    79		D	represents the minimum distance between the card's top
    80			edge and the contact area's lower edge.
    81

    83			  A	  B	  C	  D
    84	      -----------------------------------------
    85		C1	10.25	12.25	19.23	20.93
    86		C2	10.25	12.25	21.77	23.47
    87		C3	10.25	12.25	24.31	26.01
    88		C4	10.25	12.25	26.85	28.55
    89		C5	17.87	19.87	19.23	20.93
    90		C6	17.87	19.87	21.77	23.47
    91		C7	17.87	19.87	24.31	26.01
    92		C8	17.87	19.87	26.85	28.55
    93	
    94	
    95	Older card systems (defined in a French AFNOR standard) had these
    96	contacts located higher (distance from the top between 9.07 mm and
    97	18.39 mm, distance from the left identical). As some decoders support
    98	both contact area alternatives, make sure that this old contact area is
    99	properly isolated or you'll produce a short circuit when inserting your
   100	card. You may have noticed, that the contacts are arranged in the usual
   101	1/10 inch (= 2.54 mm) system (i.e. like the pins of a 8-pin DIL chip).
   102	
   103	You can produce your card adapter by making a PCB with contact areas at
   104	the above listed locations. The PCB must have precisely the thickness
   105	and width of a real card, but it may be longer, so that you can locate
   106	the interface electronics on the part which remains outside the slot.
   107	Cards are inserted in most decoders with the contacts on the bottom
   108	side. Normal PCBs are about 1.3 mm think and won't fit into the slot.
   109	Either you get a PCB which is about 0.8 mm thick or you make it
   110	thinner, e.g. by using a sander machine. Perhaps you find also ready to
   111	use test cards with connectors instead of producing your own or you
   112	simply open the decoder, clamp contacts to the resistors near the card
   113	slot and insert a normal plastic card in order to activate the
   114	card-presence switch (this is NOT recommended: there are unisolated 230
   115	V parts inside the decoder and they could kill you if you are not very
   116	carefull!!!).
   117	
   118	The adapter will only need the card contacts I/O, GND, RST and VCC. On
   119	the RS-232 side, the following contacts will be used:
   120	
   121			   Sub-D 25-pin	   Sub-D 9-pin
   122	      ---------------------------------------------------------
   123		TxD		2		3	transmit data
   124		RxD		3		2	receive data
   125		RTS		4		7	request to send
   126		CTS		5		8	clear to send
   127		DSR		6		6	data set ready
   128		GND		7		5	ground
   129		DCD		8		1	carrier detect (here: reset)
   130		DTR		20		4	data terminal ready
   131	
   132	
   133	The pins DTR, DSR and CTS are not actually needed, they are just
   134	connected together in the adapter, so that defined levels are available
   135	on them because some software might need this. RTS is connected to an
   136	unused MAX232 input and the corresponding TTL output might be used for
   137	generating the reset signal if the adapter is used for connecting a PC
   138	to a card instead of an decoder.
   139	
   140	The following components are necessary for the adapter
   141	
   142		1 x	0.5-0.8 mm PCB single sided or test card
   143		1 x	IC Maxim MAX232CPE (or Linear Technology LT1081CN)
   144		1 x	IC 74LS07 (or 7407)
   145		5 x	capacitors 1 uF (or higher), 16 V
   146		1 x	female Sub-D connector (9 or 25-pin)
   147		1 x	card slot (optional)
   148	
   149	These components cost together less than 20 DM.
   150	
   151	The MAX232 converts the RS-232 levels (about +10 and -10 V) to TTL
   152	voltage  (0 and +5 V) and vice versa without requiring anything else
   153	than +5 V power supply. This chip contains two TTL->RS-232 and two
   154	RS-232->TTL drivers and needs four external 1 uF capacitors in order
   155	to generate the RS-232 voltage internally. The adapter electronic gets
   156	its power supply from the decoder's VCC line or you can use an external
   157	5 V supply if you wish.
   158	
   159	The card slot's RST line is connected using one of the TTL->RS-232
   160	drivers in the MAX232 to DCD, so that the software and the decoder can
   161	easily resynchronize in case of a protocol error.
   162	
   163	The I/O line is a bidirectional half-duplex asynchronous TTL level
   164	serial port that is operated in a Videocrypt system with 9600 bits/s.
   165	We can connect this line to a MAX232 TTL input driver (which is
   166	connected to RxD and sends bytes to the PC) in order to receive data
   167	from the decoder. The TxD signal is converted in the MAX232 to TTL
   168	level and is connected with an open collector TTL driver to I/O. This
   169	open collector driver (one of six in the 74LS07) has a high impedance
   170	output during idle state and 1 and is connected to GND during a 0 on
   171	it's input. As there is already a pull-up resistor to +5 V on I/O in
   172	the decoder, this circuitry guarantees, that the adapter is in high
   173	impedance state if the TxD line is idle and delivers the correct
   174	voltage if the PC sends bytes and the decoder is in reception mode. As
   175	we don't connect totem-pole or tristate outputs to I/O, a short circuit
   176	should be impossible in the adapter.
   177	
   178	The following diagram describes the whole interface:
   179

   198	                                          74LS07
   199	    At the MAX232, pin 2 delivers
   200	    +10 V and pin 6 delivers -10 V.        (also connected to 74LS07:
   201	                                           pin 7=GND, pin 14=VCC)
   202	
   203	
   204	Pay attention to the polarity of the capacitors (marked with a + in the
   205	diagram next to each capacitor)! The -->-- symbols in the AX232
   206	diagram above indicate the voltage converters inside the chip. You
   207	might want to add an LED and a resistor (between 220 and 1k ohm)
   208	between VCC and GND so that you can see when the decoder activates the
   209	interface. If you can't live without blinking bits, then add a LED and
   210	a resistor from VCC to I/O. The capacitor between VCC and GND is not
   211	absolutely necessary, but recommended especially if you add other
   212	circuitry on the board (e.g. the quartz oscillator described below).
   213	
   214	As a side effect of this simple interface design, every byte sent by
   215	the PC is at the same time also received by the PC. Consequently, you
   216	can test the circuit with a terminal emulator and external +5 V supply
   217	by switching of local echo: if you still see every typed character
   218	immediately on the screen, the interface should be all right. Software
   219	must be capable of dealing with this echo from the interface. As
   220	specified in the ISO standard, the decoder activates VCC only shortly
   221	before a reset and deactivates VCC again if an answer-to-reset packet
   222	isn't received from the card in time after the reset signal.
   223	
   224	A few additional hints:
   225	
   226	If you have a larger distance between the PC an the decoder, then
   227	locate the adapter electronic near the decoder, because the RS-232
   228	interface is much more suitable for long cables than the TTL signals. 
   229	Cables of 12 m length have sucessfully been used and you shouldn't have
   230	problems with RS-232 cables up to 25 m length and more.
   231	
   232	You can also use this adapter circuit to allow a PC to listen to the
   233	data traffic between a decoder and a real card. Just connect the real
   234	card and the adapter parallel to the decoder and don't let the PC
   235	software transmit anything. Suitable card slots are available for
   236	little money from various manufacturers (see below for addresses).
   237	Videocrypt uses the inverse convention data format, i.e., you have to
   238	reverse and invert the bits in each byte in the PC software in order to
   239	get the correct byte value. For more details about the protocol, check
   240	ISO 7816-3.
   241	
   242	There are many alternative ways to build this interface if you don't
   243	have some of the components available. E.g. the MAX232 could be
   244	replaced by the fully compatible LT1081 from Linear Technology. The
   245	circuit still works fine if you use higher capacitors than 1 uF (e.g.
   246	my prototype worked fine with 4 22 uF types which were left from a
   247	previous project), but use equally sized capacitors. If you use the pin
   248	compatible MAX220 (a low power version) instead of the MAX232, then use
   249	capacitors with 10 uF or higher. The MAX232 should be the easiest
   250	available one of these chips. If it is more convenient for your layout,
   251	then you can use instead of the 1->2 driver in the 74LS07 one of the
   252	remaining 5 drivers at the pins 3->4, 5->6, 9->8, 11->10 and 13->12. If
   253	your local electronic store doesn't have a 74LS07 or 7407, then use
   254	e.g. two of the six open collector inverters in a 74LS05 (same pin
   255	assignment as the 74LS07) in series and a 2.2k pull-up resistor to VCC
   256	between them. Peoples have also suggested quick-and-dirty designs where
   257	the 74LS07 open-collector driver is replaced by a 100 ohm resistor and
   258	the MAX232 by a CMOS inverter.
   259	
   260	If you don't have the experience to etch your own PCB (it's not very
   261	difficult) or don't know someone who does, then you could solder the
   262	components in a universal raster PCB or plug them into an experimental
   263	board. Then produce just a simple PCB with only the ISO card contacts
   264	and connections to outside the decoder by mechanically removing the
   265	thin copper layer with a good knive between the 4 contacts and lines.
   266	
   267	Peoples have also suggested to use an empty German phone card, which
   268	also has ISO contacts. Remove the integrated chip from the other
   269	non-contact side, test whether the contacts are now isolated from each
   270	other and use a special conductive ink you'll find in an electronics
   271	store in order to draw connections to the end of the card were you
   272	connect wires. I haven't tested this and don't know how well it works,
   273	but you might also consider it. If you ask dealers who sell Videocrypt
   274	clone cards, you might also get a suitable PCB with card contacts for
   275	little money.
   276	
   277	You can use the same circuit with a few modifications in order to
   278	connect a PC to a smart card. This allows you to use the PC in order to
   279	emulate a decoder from the card's point of view.
   280	
   281	Just connect the card's RST input to pin 12 of the MAX232 so that you
   282	can control the RST line with the RS-232 RTS signal. Add a 20k pull-
   283	upresistor from the card's I/O line to VCC. In addition, you'll have to
   284	generate a 3.57 MHz CLK signal for the card. If you use other
   285	frequencies, remember that the time for one protocol bit is 372 CLK
   286	periods and you'll have to adjust the bits/sec rate. Either you'll find
   287	a complete 3.5 or 3.579545 MHz quartz oscillator which delivers a TTL
   288	signal or you build one like the following circuit using a 3.579545 MHz
   289	quartz (easily available, because each NTSC TV set contains one) and 2
   290	of the 6 CMOS inverters in a 74HC04. I've also tried a 74HCT04 and a
   291	4069, but they both are less suitable. And of course you'll need an
   292	external regulated +5 V power supply (a decoder will give you only VCC
   293	and CLK while it is talking to a card). In order to protect both the
   294	card and the adapter, it might be a good idea to put a 10 ohm resistor
   295	in all lines to the card (and perhaps even protection diodes to VCC and
   296	GND). If you don't already have a VCC/GND capacitor near the 74HC04,
   297	then add 0.1 uF between VCC and GND.

   316	You can easily build a universal device that can be operated in two
   317	modes by changing the position of two jumpers:
   318	
   319	  a) In the first mode, you have a PC<->decoder adapter. The PCB is plugged
   320	     into the card slot of a decoder, and either you let the PC talk
   321	     to the decoder or you put a card into the additional slot on your
   322	     device and use the PC in order to listen to the traffic between
   323	     card and decoder. Use the jumpers in order to connect pins CLK and
   324	     RST of your card slot to those of the decoder.
   325	
   326	  b) In the second mode of operation, you have a PC<->card adapter. The
   327	     device is not connected with the decoder and you have to attach a
   328	     +5 V power supply. The jumpers are switched, so that your card slot
   329	     has its CLK pin connected to the output of the above quartz oscillator
   330	     and the RST pin to pin 12 of the MAX232. As in this mode the PCB
   331	     isn't plugged into the decoder, it is convenient to have tiny
   332	     feets attached to the PCB so that you can put it on a table.
   333	
   334	Now you've built a cheap and flexible debugging tool for all ISO 7816
   335	compatible smart card systems that use an asynchronous protocol. Other
   336	ideas are to add a chip socket for a microcontroller (e.g. a PIC16C84
   337	from Microchip or a 8032+EPROM from Intel) parallel to the additional
   338	card slot and to add pins where you can easily connect an oscilloscope.
   339	This allows you to debug card software for microcontrollers easily.
   340	Feel free to produce and sell such a device, but if you do it
   341	commercially, please be nice and don't forget to send me a free one,
   342	too. :-)

   354	A few final remarks about the security of the adapter:
   355	
   356	Normally, both the RS-232 interface and the decoder slot should not be
   357	harmed by short circuits, but be careful. Also try to avoid
   358	electrostatic voltage (e.g. generated by walking on a suitable carpet)
   359	near the interface, because discharges cause easily decoder or PC
   360	crashes and could theoretically even harm the hardware (especially CMOS
   361	chips like the 74HC04). Before connecting the decoder and the PC the
   362	first time, you might want to check the voltage between the two GND
   363	lines. In correct installations, the difference of the GND potentials
   364	is very low (below 1 V), but someone has reported up to 50 V (high
   365	impedance only). Most TV sets, VCRs, SAT receivers and decoders are not
   366	connected with the earth line, so their GND potential is floating or
   367	sometimes only defined by e.g. the shielding of the antenna cable. If
   368	your antenna system is not correctly installed, the shield might also
   369	not be grounded. One quick solution might be to switch off all
   370	components and then connect first the RS-232 GND line to e.g. the GND
   371	in the SCART connector or the GND at an audio connector of your decoder
   372	before connecting anything else. You might also design the ISO contacts
   373	on the PCB so that GND touches all pins at first when the PCB is
   374	inserted in the card slot. The only really secure protection between
   375	your PC and your decoder would be to use an isolating RS-232 driver
   376	(e.g. you might want to check data sheets of Maxim's MAX250/251/252
   377	chips which offer RS-232 protection up to 1500 V), but under normal
   378	circumstances you won't need this.
   379	
   380	Use this circuit at your own risk and please don't blame me if anything
   381	doesn't work or produces only smoke and noise. Good luck ... ;-)
