     9	I had asked:
    10	
    11	Do you rich people with movie collections edit "stock"
    12	Hollywood footage into your home movies?  Do you ever
    13	produce "Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid" or "Zellig" movies
    14	where you play opposite some famous movies star(s)?

    16	Only one respondant, Don Pavlish (ag167@cleveland.Freenet.edu) replied.
    17	He sent me some great ideas for special effects and lots of info about
    18	in-camera editing.  Here are some of his hints.
    19	
    20	1.  SPLIT SCREEN:
    21	
    22	Get a small (maybe 9" x 9") mirror (WITHOUT A FRAME/BORDER)
    23	and hold it so it takes up about half of the picture:
    24	
    25	        ---------------
    26	        |      :mirror|
    27	        |      :mirror|
    28	        |      :mirror|
    29	        ---------------
    30	
    31	Now, hold the mirror at a 45 degree angle to the camera:
    32	
    33	TOP VIEW:
    34	
    35	  _________
    36	  |camera |-|
    37	  |       | |        
    38	  |_______|-|     `   <---- mirror
    39	                   `
    40	
    41	               
    42	The screen will appear split, the half with out the mirrt(or will
    43	be on the left, and on the right you will see whatever is directly to
    44	the right (from camera's point of view) of the mirror. This can
    45	be used for one of those scenes where someone is speaking on the
    46	phone to someone else, and you see both of them via split screen... etc.
    47	
    48	2.  SUPERIMPOSE A GHOST on a SCENE:
    49	
    50	
    51	Use the same setup as the mirror trick, expect:
    52	 
    53	a) use a block of glass instead of a mirror
    54	b) instead of covering the screen halfway, cover the ENTIRE screen
    55	   with the angled mirror.
    56	
    57	Aim the camera at say, a long shot of a room (dim lighting works
    58	best). Now the camera is shooting through the angled mirror:
    59	
    60	
    61	TOP VIEW:
    62	
    63	  |camera |-|     `
    64	  |       | |      `    <--- glass                     ROOM
    65	  |_______|-|       `
    66	                     `
    67	              PERSON'S
    68	               FACE
    69	
    70	
    71	Position a face up close to the glass so it reflects in the
    72	glass (light the face with a flashlight). The camera will see the
    73	room normally through the glass, and a reflection of a large face
    74	on the glass... Your face will be superimposed over the room.
    75	
    76	This can be used, for example, to have a huge face in a window (
    77	(the window is where the ROOM is in the above diagram, and make sue
    78	sure you do it at night so the window is dark, since the reflection
    79	will show up best against a dark background.)
    80	
    81	
    82	3.  WHIP-PAN:
    83	
    84	
    85	Ever done a "whip-pan"? This is a trick that, when used properly
    86	in a movie, will signal a change of location.
    87	
    88	At the end of a scene in location A, when the last shot is
    89	finished and you are about to hit the record PAUSE/STOP button,
    90	suddenly 'whip' the camera around to one side, fast as possible,
    91	and while the camera is in motion, hit the PAUSE/STOP button. Then,
    92	move to your new location, and start the camera 'whipping' to
    93	begin. A second or two later, stop the camera on your actor.
    94	
    95	You will have to fool around and figure out how soon your camera
    96	waits after you hit the button to start taping, but this trick
    97	is pretty good.
    98	
    99	It can also be used to show a man throwing a spear, for example, then
   100	the camera whips over to show a guy with a spear in his chest.
   101	The whip itself should be fast enough so everything is blurred during
   102	it. And, keep the direction of the whip steady during the cut.
   103	If you whipped the camera right for the first half of the blur, keep
   104	it going right in the second half with the new scene. A view
   105	viewer will NOT be able to see where you stopped, it will look
   106	like one continous whip.
