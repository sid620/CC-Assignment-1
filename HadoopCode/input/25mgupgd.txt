    17	     Introduction 
    18	      
    19	      
    20	      
    21	     This shareware text file provides a procedure which details a 2.5
    22	     megabyte on board RAM upgrade project. The method described replaces 16
    23	     256K dynamic RAM chips with 16 one megabit dynamic RAM chips installed
    24	     in chip sockets. Reinstallation of the ST's metal shield cover is also
    25	     not impaired.  
    26	
    27	     The beauty of this modification is that pin compatibility is simplified
    28	     by the use of sockets instead of directly soldering the 1 meg RAM chips
    29	     (DRAMs) to the motherboard and by the fact that the removed bank of
    30	     sixteen perfectly reusable 256K DRAMs can be resold by you to persons
    31	     upgrading 520STfm computers to 1 megabyte. 
    32	      
    33	     If you use this upgrade method, I recommend that you also use the same
    34	     high quality low contact resistance sockets that I used and have listed
    35	     below, than to use any other standard sockets. These are the type and
    36	     quality which are used on expansion boards made for the IBM clones.
    37	
    38	     I originally wrote this procedure to aid me in upgrading my own
    39	     1040ST's memory to 2.5 megabytes because I didn't trust myself not
    40	     making mistakes and possibly damaging any of the electronic components,
    41	     especially the new DRAMs which I didn't consider cheap. I might note
    42	     that my 1040ST's pc-board was marked Rev 4, but I don't believe that
    43	     any other recent board revisions (if they exist) for boards with 32
    44	     256K DRAMs installed should affect this procedure.  
    45	
    46	      
    47	     Disclaimer of Liability 
    48	      
    49	      
    50	     I make no claim that this modification will work for you. I can 
    51	     only say that it worked for me. This modification should not be 
    52	     attempted by anyone except by someone with experience repairing or
    53	     building digital electronic circuits. Performing this modification will
    54	     be done at your own risk and may void the warranty on your computer.

    65	      
    66	     The 256K dynamic ram chip differs from the 1 meg dynamic ram chip by
    67	     having one additional connection, namely the address input A9. The
    68	     following chip diagram illustrates this and shows pin layouts:

   102	     The 2.5 megabyte modification essentially reconnects all pins as 
   103	     previously connected on the lower of two banks of RAM chips plus adds a
   104	     new line from the previously unused A9 pin on the ST's MMU (pin 64 of
   105	     U15) to all new 1 meg chip pins A9 via a new 33 ohm resistor. Some of
   106	     the Address leads are interchanged, but this has no effect on the
   107	     operation of the computer.

   154	     Work Area 
   155	      
   156	      
   157	     Prepare your work area by placing a towel on your flat working 
   158	     surface and cover it with a layer of aluminum wrapping foil. This
   159	     provides padding for the components and a conductor for static 
   160	     electricity.

   163	     Precautions 
   164	      
   165	      
   166	     Since the slightest static discharge could easily damage 
   167	     components on your computers pc-board, always keep one hand on the
   168	     metal foil bonded along the outer rim of the pc-board before and during
   169	     touching any part of the pc-board or its components. Avoid working on
   170	     this project when the humidity is low.

   175	     Procedure 
   176	      
   177	       
   178	     1. After removing the pc-board from the insides of your computer,
   179	     desolder and remove the front 16 256K chips (U33 through U45 and U16
   180	     through U30). 
   181	      
   182	     2. Using the Exacto knife, cut the following traces on the top side of
   183	     the pc-board: 
   184	      
   185	          a. Between U30's pin 1 and U61's pin 1. 
   186	          b. Between pin 14's of U33 through U45 and U16 through U30 and
   187	          other pin 14's of U46 through U61.
   188	          c. Between the thru-hole (nearest to pin 1 in center of U32) of
   189	          U32 and U46's pin 1. (Note: This thru-hole traces to U32's pin 1
   190	          on the underside of the board.) 
   191	      
   192	     3. Using the Exacto knife, cut the following traces on the bottom side
   193	     of the pc-board: 
   194	      
   195	          a. Between U30's pin 1 and the 32 ohm resistor R76. 
   196	          b. Between U32's pins 2 and 14. Do the same for U33 through U45
   197	          and U16 through U30.
   198	          c. Between U30's pin 4 and U15's pin 8. (Note: Cut the trace after
   199	          it goes through the board to the bottom side near resistor R91,
   200	          but before it reappears on the top of the board via another
   201	          thru-hole. 
   202	          d. Between U32's pin 14 and the thru-hole located between U32 and
   203	          U33. 
   204	      
   205	     4. Preparing New Sockets and Soldering Them Inplace 
   206	      
   207	          a. On all 16 new sockets, remove the internals of pin 4. 
   208	          b. On all 16 new sockets, bend all pins 1 and 17 flat against
   209	          their bottom then up against their outer side. 
   210	          c. On 14 of the new sockets, bend pin 18's flat against their
   211	          bottom and pointing straight out to the side. 
   212	          d. On the remaining two, bend both pin 18's flat against their
   213	          bottom but back and down so it will just reach and fit into the
   214	          pc-board hole of it's adjacent pin (pin 17). These two sockets
   215	          will be installed and soldered with the socket's pin 18 going into
   216	          the old 256K chip's pin 16 hole below the new socket's pin 17.
   217	          Trial fit these two sockets at this time.
   218	          e. Using a pair of scissors, cut pieces of "Socket Wrap-ID"
   219	          plastic markers for sandwiching them between the new sockets and
   220	          the pc-board during installation. These little plastic markers
   221	          should be cut so as to electrically isolate the socket's pins 1
   222	          and 17 from leads and traces on the pc-board, and from pin 18 of
   223	          the socket for the two separately prepared sockets above, but also
   224	          so as not to interfere with seating the socket's four pads flush
   225	          with the top of the pc-board upon installation. 
   226	          f. Solder the two sockets with the bent back pin 18 and markers
   227	
   228	                                                  4
   229	
   230	
   231	          into U30 and U33. 
   232	          g. Solder the remaining sockets with markers into U34 through U45
   233	          and U16 through U29. Pin 18 of these socket's must be soldered to
   234	          the top of the board at the nearest thru-hole that the pin 18 just
   235	          barely reaches. Use plenty of heat as these thru-holes are big
   236	          heat sinks. 
   237	      
   238	     5. Mounting The New 33 Ohm Resistor 
   239	      
   240	          a. Install a new 33 ohm resistor on the pc-board by drilling two
   241	          small holes from the top at points near capacitor C55 and resistor
   242	          R70. Make sure you don't drill through a trace on the other side
   243	          by holding the pc-board up to a bright light and marking the spots
   244	          with a pencil. 
   245	      
   246	     6. Wiring 
   247	      
   248	          Wire the following connections on the top side of the board: 
   249	      
   250	          a. Between U32's new socket's pins 1 and 17 and a thru-hole on the
   251	          pc-board between U32 and U33. This thru hole is the only one that
   252	          has a trace that run to another thru-hole between U46 and U47 on
   253	          the top side of the board. 
   254	          b. Between U16's new socket's pins 1 and 17, and pin 2 of U54.
   255	          Solder the wire directly to the side of the chips pin 2. 
   256	          c. Between each of the remaining new socket's pin 1 and 17 and a
   257	          thru-hole in back of each 256K RAM chip (i.e., U47 through U53 and
   258	          U55 through U61). These thru-holes are the ones that you will find
   259	          traces back to either pin 2 or pin 14 of U47 through U61 and then
   260	          trace over toward U22, U23, U26, and U27. Actually, pins 2 and 14
   261	          are tied together on the bottom of the board for every 256K RAM
   262	          chip still installed. So that's 14 more wires altogether (i.e.,
   263	          each new RAM chip's pins 1 and 17 will be connected to the pins 2
   264	          and 14 of the 256K chip directly in back of it.  
   265	      
   266	          Wire the following connections on the bottom side of the board
   267	          (Note: all pin numbers here refer to the pin numbers on the
   268	          pc-board, not the pin numbers of the new sockets or new ram
   269	          chips): 
   270	      
   271	          d. Between U15's pin 64 and one side of the new 33 ohm resistor. 
   272	          e. Between all pin 14's of U32 through U45 and U16 through U30,
   273	          and the other side of the new 33 ohm resistor. 
   274	          f. Between all pin 2's of U32 through U45 and U16 through U30, and
   275	          the thru-hole near R91 which had its trace cut to U30's pin 4.
   276	          This thru-hole traces back on top of the pc-board under the bank
   277	          of resistors and over to U15.  
   278	          g. Between U61's pin 1, U30's pin 4, and the cut trace side of
   279	          resistor R76. 
   280	          h. Between U30's pin 1 and U61's pin 3. 
   281	      
   282	     8. Inspect all solder joints with the magnifier for solder shorts and
   283	
   284	                                                  5
   285	
   286	
   287	     faulty connections. Verify that all connections were made correct. 
   288	       
   289	     9. Install the new 1 meg RAM chips into their new sockets. 
   290	      
   291	     10.That's it! Clean isn't it? Now sit back and admire your work. 
   292	      
   293	     12.Reassemble the computer and reconnect the monitor and power cord and
   294	     let it whirl!

   300	     I am distributing this documentation as a $15.00 Shareware File. 
   301	     Please feel free to re-post on your favorite Information Service or
   302	     local BBS. I ask only that you do so in its original unaltered form. 
   303	      
   304	     If you have followed these instructions and everything worked for you,
   305	     I'm sure you will appreciate the effort I put into documenting this
   306	     project and the money it has saved you from buying one of those
   307	     expansion boards on the market or by the time you could have spent
   308	     trying to figure such a project out by yourself. Please send your
   309	     shareware user registration fee to:
