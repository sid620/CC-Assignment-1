    57	today announced shipment of its enhanced version of NetSECURE,
    58	server-based NLM network backup solution.
    59	
    60	About the Product
    61	
    62	NetSECURE was designed to integrate directly into the NetWare operating
    63	system to provide maximum performance, flexibility, and a high level of
    64	security for the user. Centralized backup allows servers and workstations
    65	to be accessed in both attended and unattended modes. NetSECURE takes full
    66	advantage of the NetWare Loadable Module (NIM) capabilities to maximize
    67	tape speed for both backup and restore. NetSECURE 4.0 supports Tallgrass'
    68	entire line of SCSI-based storage systems, with capacities ranging from
    69	250 MB to 2 GB.
    70	
    71	New features of NetSECURE 4.0 include:
    72	
    73	ù Auto Pilot - A feature set that includes the following:
    74	
    75	   ù tape rotation maintains daily, weekly, monthly and
    76	     yearly tapes, producing a complete system backup
    77	     history.
    78	
    79	   ù disk grooming removes files not accessed during 
    80	     a specified period of time and generates a specified
    81	     number of copies in permanent storage.
    82	
    83	   ù Quick Recover Restore allows full or partial recovery
    84	     automatically at any specified time.
    85	
    86	ù Directory Mirroring - allows configuration to trim the directory of the
    87	destination disk to match the source disk file structure. Files or
    88	subdirectories found in the destination directory which do not appear in
    89	the source directory can be deleted from the destination.
    90	
    91	ù Tape Usage Database - tracks the amount of tape usage for each individual
    92	cartridge. A log provides information on when the tape should be replaced
    93	or when the drive should be serviced.
    94	
    95	ù Archive Bit Backup - allows backup or archive operations to be performed
    96	based on the status of the file's archive bit.

    99	multiple drives.
