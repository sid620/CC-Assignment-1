     4	     Some Hints on How to Improve Your Graphics
     5	
     6	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     7	
     8	     Here are some hints for those of you who would like to improve your
     9	 technique when making your own illustrations, for example paintings and
    10	 title screens on the Amiga.
    11	
    12	     I would like to stress the point that this article will not turn
    13	 you into an instant artist as the subject is technique, not art.
    14	
    15	     The computer as a medium for creating graphics has some built-in
    16	 problems. However, let it be known that other mediums such as oil-paint,
    17	 watercolour, ink, and crayon just to mention a few have just as many
    18	 shortcomings and limitations.
    19	
    20	Some of the shortcomings of computer painting are:
    21	  i) the limited number of colours
    22	 ii) creating gradual shading or flow of colour
    23	iii) putting in extremely small details
    24	 iv) the step effect created by lines that are  on an angle
    25	  v) expression of material e.g. hair
    26	 vi) the screen (canvas) size
    27	
    28	     Some of these problems along with some others will be dealt with in
    29	 the course of this article.
    30	
    31	
    32	CREATING A WORKING DISK
    33	
    34	     If you  don't want to go to the trouble of creating a formatted
    35	 blank disk with a directory for the images, you  have to make enough
    36	 disk space on the disk with the painting programme to save your creations.
    37	
    38	
    39	CHOOSING YOUR OBJECT
    40	
    41	     Care should be taken in choosing your object to be painted. The
    42	 two biggest pitfalls are small details and the need for too many colours.
    43	
    44	     Start off by choosing a painting that has no more than one or two
    45	 objects. It will help you to cope with the limited number of colours at
    46	 your disposal. For this exercise I would choose a flower as most
    47	 flowers are of a single colour, and basically you will need only two
    48	 colours, one for the flower itself and one for the stem and leaves. The
    49	 other 14, or so   colours left, depending on the resolution you are
    50	 using (more of that later) can be devoted to shading, highlights, and
    51	 shadows.
    52	
    53	
    54	TRANSFER OF OBJECT TO THE SCREEN
    55	
    56	     I suggest that you copy an existing illustration to start off with
    57	 because there are enough technical problems without creating artistic
    58	 ones as well.
    59	     Having chosen your object to copy how do you get the outline and
    60	 details onto the screen? If you are painting from a photograph, postcard,
    61	 magazine, or book you are faced with the problem of transferring the
    62	 image to the screen preferably without damage to the original.
    63	     Programs like DEGAS ELITE have a grid-tool that will help you to create
    64	 a screen that looks like graph paper. Using this grid-tool create a
    65	 grid where both the vertical and horizontal lines are approximately 10
    66	 mm apart on the screen.
    67	
    68	To get the grid for Degas Elite:
    69	
    70	
    71	    Go back to the screen and count the number of whole squares from
    72	 top to bottom. Do not count the incomplete block at the top and the
    73	 bottom.
    74	
    75	     Next, go back to the picture and measure the height only. Divide
    76	 the height by the number of vertical squares that you have counted on
    77	 the  screen. For Example: picture height 260mm, number of squares  on
    78	 the screen 13. Divide 260mm by 13 screen squares = 20mm. Divide your
    79	 picture  now by drawing vertical lines 20mm apart. If you do not wish
    80	 to damage your picture stretch  a sheet of tracing paper over the top
    81	 of it and do all line work on the tracing paper.
    82	
    83	 Number the row of blocks along the top starting by  placing a 1 (one)
    84	 in the block on the left.  Number the row of vertical blocks on the
    85	 left hand side starting by placing a 1 (one) in the block at the top.
    86	 The number 1 (one) will be common to both the vertical and horizontal
    87	 rows of blocks.
    88	
    89	     Go back to the screen and with the freehand-tool write in the
    90	 numbers corresponding to those on your picture. Make sure that the
    91	 numbered grid is in the centre of the screen. (When finding the middle
    92	 line of the screen don't forget the part under the palette.) Rows of
    93	 blocks on the right and left of the centered grid can be deleted.
    94	
    95	     If your picture happens to have more horizontal blocks than the
    96	 screen has you will have to decide which part of the picture horizontally
    97	 is most important to you. This, however, does not happen very often.
    98	
    99	     Now draw the outline and details by looking at the picture and
   100	 drawing lines in the corresponding blocks. The numbers at the top
   101	 and bottom of the screen and the picture will help you to identify
   102	 corresponding blocks.The mouse is not the ideal tool for drawing, but
   103	 the outline does not have to be perfect. If you have chosen a face or
   104	 head make sure the important details such as eyes and nose are in the
   105	 right place.
   106	
   107	     When you have finished with the outline and details remove all the
   108	 grid lines by using the background colour. My use of colours, in most
   109	 cases is black for the background and cream-white or brown for the line
   110	 work and grid lines. Background colours other than black are likely to
   111	 interfere with colours in the picture and white line work is hard on
   112	 the eye.
   113	
   114	
   115	CHOOSING YOUR PIXEL SIZE
   116	
   117	     Not much choice here...unless you use something like SPECTRUM 512
   118	you've got 16 colours in lo-res.
   119	     If you are about to start your first picture I would recommend using
   120	 lo-res. (surprise,surprise) 
   121	
   122	     The interference of adjacent colours can be very useful.
   123	 Dots of white and red next to each other will result in pink.
   124	 Two white dots with one red dot on the side will give white with a pink
   125	 edge.
   126	 Five shades of grey with one red (6 basic colours)  will result in 15
   127	 colours - 1 red + 5 shades of grey + 5 combinations of red with grey +
   128	 4 further combinations of grey.
   129	
   130	     I will leave it to you to figure out the total number of combinations
   131	 possible with 16 colours.
   132	
   133	
   134	CHOOSING YOUR PALETTE
   135	
   136	     The choice of the palette is probably the most important step. A
   137	 bad choice of colours will result in a continuous struggle for more
   138	 colours. Because there is no interference from adjacent colours with
   139	 lo-res care should be taken to ensure that besides the basic  colour
   140	 chosen for your object you  have 2 or 3 shades that are lighter and
   141	 darker than it. This will make it easier to create shadows and highlights.
   142	 The computer programmes have a feature called "range". After you specify
   143	 the darkest colour and say 5 colours away, the lightest colour,
   144	 the programme will select the in-between colours. To modify the Degas
   145	 palette check them DOCs! We've also covered some other Art packages like
   146	 NEO, so take your pick!
   147	 The colour to be changed you can alter the colour with the RGB-controls.
   148	 All 16 colours can be changed, but care should be taken with some
   149	 of the colours as they are basic to background, lettering and borders.
   150	
   151	     It is of note that AMIGA users get very used to lots of colors.Because
   152	 only 16 colours are available to us it is very important that every colour 
   153	 can be used to create several other colours. For example, white with dark
   154	 green could cut out the need for light green. Some experimentation
   155	 on a free part of the screen will help you to decide.
   156	
   157	     Because I do not know what you are going to paint I can only give a
   158	 typical palette. It should contain black and white and at least 4
   159	 following shades of grey and brown. Since grey and brown are not very
   160	 strong and are easily overshadowed by the prime colours (red, blue and
   161	 yellow)  their effect will result in darker and lighter shades of the
   162	 prime colours so essential for good shadow work and highlight details.
   163	
   164	
   165	
   166	CREATING YOUR MASTERPIECE
   167	
   168	     At this stage we have an outline of the picture, and a palette. If
   169	 you wish to use the spray-paint tool this is the time to use it. Spray
   170	 painting can be very effective for some backgrounds. Choose a "spread"
   171	 that is not too big, and limit the numb er of dots. Give the background
   172	 the basic colour you want it to be and spray the desired pattern. If you
   173	 do not use "masking" of your major object the limited spread and small
   174	 number of dots will prevent too  many unwanted dots getting into your
   175	 object.
   176	 Also, staying away from the object and imitating the spray pattern close
   177	 to it using a single pixel brush will help.
   178	 If using more than one spray colour use the darker spray at the bottom and
   179	 the lighter one at the top. The dark colour will work as a foundation.
   180	 However, if you use spray for sky the darker colour should go to the top.
   181	 It will give the painting depth.
   182	
   183	
   184	     Filling in is the next step. Before you use the fill-in tool make
   185	 sure you do not have any breaks or gaps in your outline. You can check
   186	 for  breaks by using the magnifying-tool. If you overlooked a gap and
   187	 part of the painting that you didn't want to fill-in gets filled-in,
   188	 use the UNDO to remove it, close the gap and try again.
   189	 After filling-in all the basic colours check for details that are out of
   190	 place.
   191	
   192	     Most of the shading in can be obtained by using a progression
   193	 of colours. Sometimes better results are obtained by using a basic
   194	 colour and a progression of darker brown dots for red, yellow and green,
   195	 and grey dots for white and blue. At the cost of time you can create a
   196	 checkered pattern. It could for example be made up of red and brown
   197	 squares. By progressively using darker browns the red will also darken
   198	 by the influence of the brown. The brown dots can't be seen as the red
   199	 is the mo re dominant colour. It will appear that the red gets darker,
   200	 creating an illusion of a shadow. Using two shades of red will extend
   201	 the range from light to dark even further.
   202	
   203	     A typical annoying feature of computer graphics is that lines on an
   204	 angle and curves have little steps. Most of these steps can be eliminated
   205	 by putting in an intermediate colour. For example, if the object with the
   206	 steps is red and the background colour is black put brown dots in
   207	 the corners of the steps. The ragged outline will then be smoothed out.
   208	
   209	     Most of what has been said here can be seen by scrutinizing my two
   210	 paintings on this disk. Both of the paintings are med-res and they can
   211	 be transferred to a painting programme to be looked at with the
   212	 magnifying-tool.
   213	
   214	
   215	BACK-UP
   216	
   217	     Finally, I would like to advise you to save your work each hour. 
   218	  Also, at the end of your day's work make a back-up copy. Detailed 
   219	 paintings can take several days to complete.
   220	 To lose a painting because of memory or disk failure can be very
   221	 disheartening. (And don't we just know it!!)

   226	TEX PAINT-HINTS..Part of a series in ST NEWS disc magazine.
   227	
   228	by Erik of The Exceptions
   229	
   230	The fourth part of this highly popular series is here. This time, 
   231	ES will talk about some graphic-tricks like transparent graphics, 
   232	anti-aliasing and more like that.   
   233	
   234	 Hi de hi, readers! Have you gained enough energy for yet another 
   235	round  of TEX-tips?  For this part you don't even  need  specific 
   236	assembler knowledge,  since it mainly covers my personal field of 
   237	expertise:  Graphics.  Some  of you might now think that  there's 
   238	rather little left to be said about that;  many pages in books as 
   239	well  as  magazines have been filled with  the  subject  already, 
   240	aren't they?  But I am sure that there are some more or less rare 
   241	tricks and tips from which you didn't know anything;  or are  you 
   242	familiar with:
   243	
   244	 - Anti-aliasing
   245	 - Animated graphics by palette animation
   246	 - Transparent effects
   247	 - Back-and foreground scrolling without programming trouble
   248	
   249	  You don't know anything about this?  Then it'll be soon -  just 
   250	read  on.  Additionally,  I  will tell you  something  about  the 
   251	"Neochrome"  drawing program that your surely didn't  know.  Just 
   252	like all earlier episodes in this series,  all things said  refer 
   253	to  the low resolution of the ST,  where you can normally use  16 
   254	colours  (readers of ST NEWS Volume 3 Issue 5 will now of  course 
   255	chuckle lightly).
   256	  Well,  let's  start  to talk about the  subjects  listed  above 
   257	systematically.  'Anti-aliasing' is listed first there.  This  is 
   258	commonly  used  in  professional  circles  of  computer  graphics 
   259	artists. Freely interpreted, this would mean: "How the heck can I 
   260	avoid that gradation in my computer picture?"
   261	 You all know that the ST, just like its colleague-homecomputers, 
   262	has  a  fairly  limited  screen  resolution.   This  means   that 
   263	especially  diagonal  lines or circles show  typical  gradations. 
   264	Since we cannot fool the hardware in this case, we'll simply have 
   265	to fool another 'peripheral':  The human eye.  We can hereby  use 
   266	the way an eye sees contrast.  When Anti-aliasing,  one uses  the 
   267	following scheme: At the boundary of two colours, one insert some 
   268	dots  on  the  gradation that have colours  in  between  the  two 
   269	colours that you use. That's all.
   270	  To  demonstrate the remarkable effect,  please  make  a  little 
   271	practical exercise. You surely have a drawing program with a zoom 
   272	function. Load it and define the following colours:
   273	
   274	  Background color - 000
   275	  Drawing color 1  - 711
   276	  Drawing color 2  - 600
   277	  Drawing color 3  - 400
   278	  Drawing color 4  - 300
   279	
   280	  Now just draw a triangle with drawing colour 1,  and  therefore 
   281	draw three lines, for example for the upper left corner (position 
   282	x=0 and y=0) to position x=20 and y=80, then back to x=0 and y=80 
   283	and  then back to the upper left hand corner.  Fill it  as  well, 
   284	with  drawing  color 1.  Now,  a bright red triangle is  on  your 
   285	screen  of which the right side clearly demonstrates the  typical 
   286	gradation.
   287	 Now copy this triangle,  so that you have two triangles next  to 
   288	each  other  on  the screen.  The second one will  now  be  anti-
   289	aliased.
   290	 Enter zoom mode again and select drawing color 2. Put ONE dot of 
   291	this color on each 'stairs' of the gradation at the right side of 
   292	the triangle.  Then select drawing color 3 and do the same, and a 
   293	third  time  with  drawing color 4.  Now  you  have  added  three 
   294	darkening red colors to every gradation. Leave zoom mode and look 
   295	at the effect.  The difference is quite stunning,  isn't it?  The 
   296	second triangle seems to be displayed in a much higher resolution 
   297	than the first one. That's anti-aliasing; quite simple!
   298	 When you'd like to experiment a bit more,  you can draw a filled 
   299	circle  in drawing color 1 and again put the darkening shades  of 
   300	red on the gradation steps.  You will then also develop a feeling 
   301	of where you can put which number of anti-aliasing-dots,  since a 
   302	circle contains all different gradation sizes.
   303	 Using this technique,  all graphics can be enhanced if the color 
   304	palette has been properly designed.  In our example,  black (000) 
   305	was the background color,  bright red (711) the drawing color and 
   306	2-4 were the anti-aliasing colors.
   307	 Have fun experimenting with these effects!
   308	
   309	 Now,  what's up next?  Ah! Color palette animation! First, let's 
   310	start with a small explanation what this actually is.
   311	  The ST has sixteen color registers;  when some or all of  these 
   312	are  swapped in a cyclic way,  this is called 'color cycling'  or 
   313	palette animation.  This is often used to simulate flowing water, 
   314	and  one of the oldest "Neochrome" pictures,  "Waterfall",  is  a 
   315	typical example.  In this case,  the shades of blue contained  in 
   316	the water are swapped in a circle.
   317	 But there are much more possibilities with palette animation.  I 
   318	have  always  had the dubious pleasure of creating  effects  with 
   319	this  that many people considered to be  graphic  programming.  A 
   320	very  nice application of this technique can be found in the  TEX 
   321	program "Super Neo Demo Show".  There is a scrolling text in  the 
   322	lower  border of the screen,  and under that are a lot  of  small 
   323	propellers.  After  this  introduction you will probably  not  be 
   324	surprised  to  hear  that these rotating lines  are  nothing  but 
   325	palette  animation  - which many people were  when  we  initially 
   326	explained this trick to them.
   327	 How it's done?
   328	  Well,  it's quite difficult to put into words (like  love,  ex-
   329	ED.), but I'll give it a try.
   330	  Just imagine that you've drawn 12 lines that cross one  another 
   331	in  the middle;  each line has its own color.  Now,  you set  all 
   332	colors  to  black with one exceptions:  One  color  remains  e.g. 
   333	black.  In the middle you put a small circle with a non-animating 
   334	color  to cover the part where all lines cross.  If you  now  let 
   335	these  12  colors cycle,  you have the impression of  a  rotating 
   336	line,  since  only one of the 12 lines is displayed in red  at  a 
   337	time.
   338	 There are more tricks of this kind, e.g. the hopping dots in the 
   339	2nd Psych-O-Screen of our "B.I.G. Demo", but they principally all 
   340	use the same trick:  About all used colors are put in  background 
   341	color,  and only some of them are colored;  by palette animation, 
   342	movement starts. One can use this to such extend that an animated 
   343	figure, e.g. a little man, walks across the screen. The method is 
   344	the same;  you draw the movement phases in an other color at each 
   345	time  and  you  set  them next to each  other  (they  should  not 
   346	overlap).  Since each of the men 'lights up' after the other  due 
   347	to  the  color animation,  it appears as though the  shape  walks 
   348	across   the  screen.   True  animation  effects  can   thus   be 
   349	accomplished  by animating the colors.  The disadvantage of  this 
   350	trick  is  obvious:  When  you  use a lot  of  colors  for  color 
   351	animation,  only  few are left for the rest of the  picture.  But 
   352	that's each one's own decision.
   353	
   354	 Well,  dear readers, now we're really starting. The previous was 
   355	only  to be classified among 'harmless toying  around',  but  now 
   356	we're  really cookin'.  Maybe you have seen graphics that  seemed 
   357	like  transparent  glass or that seemed to float in some  of  our 
   358	programs.  Maybe  you  wondered  which  wonderful  and  difficult 
   359	program sat behind it all.  Ha!  All wrong! I suppose you're just 
   360	about used to it, but this is also covered by a sleazy trick. But 
   361	to  understand  it,  you must know something  about  the  graphic 
   362	buildup of the ST - so I will mention it here in short to refresh 
   363	your memory.
   364	 In low resolution, it looks like this: A certain piece of memory 
   365	is referred to as 'screen memory'.  There, four sequential memory 
   366	words  (1 word = 16 bits) always belong together,  and each  word 
   367	represents a so-called 'plane'.  It's best to imagine these  four 
   368	words  lying under each other;  this way you see best  that  each 
   369	pixel is represented by four bits.  According to this combination 
   370	of bits,  the color value is taken from one of the sixteen  color 
   371	registers. With a resolution of 320x200 (640,000 pixels) of which 
   372	each pixel can take one of 16 colors,  each plane is therefore  8 
   373	Kb in size; an ST graphic screen thus costs 32 Kb.
   374	  These planes do not only have to be used to  represent  colors, 
   375	but  when you truly look upon them as 'planes' and use them  like 
   376	that program-technically, there are some interesting aspects.
   377	  Let's presume we made a piece of graphics that only uses  eight 
   378	colors.  These  colors  can be realised with only 3  'planes'  (3 
   379	'stacked'  bits  means 8 combinations possible),  so  that  their 
   380	colors will be found in color registers 1 to 8.  But there's  one 
   381	plane left!  In this plane, it is for example possible to display 
   382	a piece of graphics that only uses one color.  When we set  color 
   383	registers  9-16  to the same value,  we can move  this  piece  of 
   384	graphics  in  just one plane (the program only uses  each  fourth 
   385	word) and the corresponding bit combinations only give the colors 
   386	in register 9-16. That's how it is possible to put a single-color 
   387	piece  of  graphics  on  top of one that  has  8  colors  without 
   388	difficult logical operations.
   389	 That's all.
   390	
   391	 Oh,  I hear you call:  "What's up then with transparent effects, 
   392	and fore-and background,  eh?!" Well,  program-technical  nothing 
   393	else  happens  than what I just described  above.  All  else   is 
   394	simple brainmangling thought about setting proper color palettes. 
   395	Again: Transparent-as well as back-and foreground effects are now 
   396	only realised by simply setting proper color palettes!
   397	 Therefore you must thoroughly realise what's happening with  the 
   398	bit  combinations when a piece of graphics in one plane is  moved 
   399	'over'  the  three  others.  The  colors  that  result  into  the 
   400	corresponding effect are always the last eight (number 9-16), the 
   401	colors   located  that  are  called  by  the  corresponding   bit 
   402	combinations are located there.  These are the colors that appear 
   403	when  the  separate plane is moved 'over' the other  three  -  in 
   404	other words when the fourth bit (fourth plane) is set or cleared.
   405	 When you understand this, it is easy to think of a way to create 
   406	the 'transparent' effect:  Simply put intermediate colors in  the 
   407	upper  half of the palette that correspond to the  brightness  of 
   408	the other eight.  In our program example (present in the disk  in 
   409	the  PROGRAMS folder as a .S file) a bright red 'plate of  glass' 
   410	moves  over a background pattern that only uses shades  of  grey. 
   411	The colors are hereby set as follows:  Color 1-8 are black  (000) 
   412	along all shades of grey to white (777). The 'transparent colors' 
   413	9-16  go from dark red (004) to yellow (770).  So when  the  one-
   414	color  graphics block of the fourth plane goes 'over'  the  other 
   415	three planes,  color 9 appears where 1 used to appear, 10 where 2 
   416	used to appear,  etc.  Program-technically speaking, this is very 
   417	simple, but about that we haven't even talked.
   418	 Udo and the others were also quite blabbergasted when I came  up 
   419	with the idea,  you'll believe me.  The whole back-and foreground 
   420	business is very much the same;  just look at the B.I.G. scroller 
   421	in  our "B.I.G.  Demo" where a scrolling text scrolls in  between 
   422	the fore-and background.
   423	  With  this effect,  one has to set the upper  eight  colors  as 
   424	follows:  With  each of the colors that the one-colored piece  of 
   425	graphics should go behind,  you set the corresponding upper color 
   426	to  the same.  All colors that should be covered by the  graphics 
   427	block  should get the value you want them to have when they  move 
   428	'in front' of it.  So if you want the one-plane graphics block to 
   429	move  all in the background of all three other planes,  one  sets 
   430	the upper colors exactly the same as the lower ones.
   431	 Not really simple, you think?
   432	 Hmm.  You might be right.  But we do everything to get the  very 
   433	last thing possible out of the ST, don't we?
   434	  With this effects,  it is also not quite simple to put it  into 
   435	words (sigh, ex-ED.). When you have a look at our listing (in the 
   436	PROGRAMS folder), your last doubts will disappear.
   437	 The program does the following:  It builds a background  pattern 
   438	in three planes, thus using the first eight colors. It then makes 
   439	a graphic block in the fourth plane move to and fro.  Using  keys 
   440	1-4,  it is possible to call different color palettes,  that will 
   441	support  the  description I have above.  By only  pressing  these 
   442	keys, the following effects are realised:
   443	
   444	 Key 1 : Palette 1, one-colored block moves over graphics
   445	 Key 2 : Palette 2, block moves in background
   446	 Key 3 : Palette 3, block moves through the pattern
   447	 Key 4 : Palette 4, transparent block moves over graphics
   448	
   449	  Have  fun  trying.  It is easy to use some of  your  own  color 
   450	palettes; some extremely funny effects can be created that way.
   451	
   452	 This almost made an end to this issue's "Wizards"  article.  But 
   453	at the end I found it necessary to make a plea.  No! Nothing like 
   454	"Tortured  ST users everywhere get together!";  it is  much  more 
   455	about my favourite drawing program that I (and many others) think 
   456	is one of the most grotesquely underestimated programs on the ST. 
   457	I'm  talking about "Neochrome" here,  that was supplied with  the 
   458	Atari ST in the early days (version 0.5).  It was supposed to  be 
   459	sold  in  the  better version 1.0,  but  it  was  never  properly 
   460	marketed.  Most salesmen also considered 1.0 to be Public  Domain 
   461	and that's why just about every ST user could get the program.
   462	  The reasons why the program is so gut will be explained to  you 
   463	in just a little while,  when I will tell you something about the 
   464	program  that  most of you probably didn't  know.  The  basis  is 
   465	actually  brief:   "Neochrome"  already  includes  (almost)   all 
   466	functions one would need for creating GOOD pictures;  unnecessary 
   467	function  are  not present and it is  fast,  very  FAST.  It  has 
   468	several  function that would even make "Degas Elite" look  rather 
   469	basic.
   470	 When you've drawn pictures yourself,  you'll have to admit  that 
   471	the most important tool of all is the zoom mode.  On the contrary 
   472	to all other drawing programs that are available, "Neochrome" has 
   473	a  zoom  mode that is always present,  also when you  operate  on 
   474	blocks,  draw lines,  fill,  etc. This zoom mode is very fast, by 
   475	the  way,   because  it  uses  raster  interrupts.  Further,  the 
   476	'Jackknife' function allows you to cut out whatever form you want 
   477	(not  just  polygons),  and  these  can  also  be  moved  in  the 
   478	background ("DPaint II" on the Amiga can't even do that!).
   479	 I suppose you already know the functions that are implemented on 
   480	the "Neochrome" menu. So I will now talk about some function that 
   481	are not so obvious;  you might be in for a surprise! Many things, 
   482	for  example,  are  hidden  in the right  mouse  button:  In  the 
   483	'normal'  block  menu,  the current block is set on  the  current 
   484	position,  but  with 'Jackknife' you can DRAW with  pressing  the 
   485	right button, just like a brush (and, unlike other programs, this 
   486	also  happens FAST)!  While in 'brush' mode,  pressing the  right 
   487	mouse  button takes care that you draw with the colors that  have 
   488	been installed between the 'color arrows' - this is also the case 
   489	when using nozzles (highly effective when using color animation).
   490	  When you're in 'grabber' mode,  you can get the color of  every 
   491	pixel on the screen you want by pressing the right mouse  button. 
   492	In  'line' mode,  the current line is deleted when you press  the 
   493	right  button with the left one.  When double-clicking the  right 
   494	mouse button on the eraser icon, the entire screen is erased.
   495	 But now a very hot tip,  since only few people know that there's 
   496	a  complete  animation tool in  "Neochrome"!  Dave  Staugas,  the 
   497	programmer, had no time to make it completely bug-free so that he 
   498	just hid it.  This is the way to get the new icon on the  screen: 
   499	Go  to the 'grabber' mode and click with the right  mouse  button 
   500	precisely in the curve of the last 'R' in the word 'GRABBER' that 
   501	will  appear  on  the right side of  the  menu.  A  small  camera 
   502	appears!
   503	  You can now do the following after selecting that  camera:  You 
   504	can define an animation area with the mouse. With the right mouse 
   505	button  you  can now slide the whole picture through  this  area. 
   506	When you have the right part,  you simply click on 'add' and  the 
   507	part  of  the  picture is in  'animation  memory'.  Add  as  many 
   508	pictures as you want,  and then you slide the cutout back on  the 
   509	first cutout (only Dave knows why) and you can use the arrows  to 
   510	play the animation forwards as well as backwards.  With 'Del', it 
   511	is possible to delete the current screen,  and 'Load' and  'Save' 
   512	also  work  (just don't get startled when  the  fileselector  box 
   513	that's busted - stop animation before!). Just experiment a little 
   514	with the animation tool; unlike all other animation tools for the 
   515	ST, this one's EASY to use. The biggest advantage is that you can 
   516	edit  a  figure  that has to be animated  right  in  the  drawing 
   517	program.
   518	 But be warned:  This new menu option is not bug free!  It is for 
   519	example  not quite smart to press the Undo key or make  the  menu 
   520	disappear while the camera is selected.  So it's probably  better 
   521	to  save your picture before you enter the animation  tool.  When 
   522	you  have the VERY OLD St demo with the flying  parrot,  you  can 
   523	load  it  without  problems.  But  do  not  forget  to  load  the 
   524	accompanying picture before (the shore landscape) with regard  to 
   525	the color palette.
   526	
   527	  Finally,  a little gag:  You can define the colors in the  menu 
   528	yourself!  When started up,  "Neochrome" looks for a file  called 
   529	"NEO.CMP"  in which 512 words with color values need to  be  that 
   530	will replace the preset palette.
   531	  When  you intend to use "Neochrome" more often in  the  future, 
   532	look  into  your heart and give good ol' Dave something  for  his 
   533	trouble  and his really good program.  He is currently  a  system 
   534	programmer  at Atari and quite disappointed about the  fact  that 
   535	his excellent program wasn't treated accordingly in the  magazine 
   536	- and we're not even talking about the lousy marketing. Financial 
   537	contributions can be sent to:

   544	
   545	  If you're a "Neochrome" fan,  do not falter!  Dave wrote to  me 
   546	that  he  will consider rewriting old source stuff and  making  a 
   547	better "Neochrome" version if the 'fanmail' is accordingly. I beg 
   548	you: Do so!
   549	
   550	 Well,  dear readers,  again we have told you some of our tricks, 
   551	but  the  crown on our work of 'hardware-torturing'  has  yet  to 
   552	come;  we're hereby talking about getting rid of the lower border 
   553	so  that  graphics can be displayed there  as  well!  Using  this 
   554	trick,  you  will be able to effectively display more lines  than 
   555	ever before anticipated by the developers of the ST.
   556	 Just wait for the next episode...
   557	 Bye, bye.
   558
