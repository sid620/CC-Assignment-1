    17	  TITLE:
    18	      Loading STACKER into upper memory ("loading high") with MS-DOS 5.0
    19	
    20	  OVERVIEW:
    21	      MS-DOS 5.0 comes equipped with a memory manager which may be used to load
    22	      device drivers into the upper memory area between 640K and 1MB.  STACKER
    23	      is one such driver.
    24	
    25	  ISSUES/COMMENTS:
    26	      1) DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS provides access to extended memory and ensures
    27	      that no two programs use the same portion of it at the same time.
    28	
    29	      2) DOS=UMB tells DOS to maintain a link to the upper memory area;
    30	      DOS=HIGH,UMB also loads the kernel of DOS into the high memory area
    31	      (HMA).
    32	
    33	      3) DEVICE = C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE NOEMS causes extended memory to simulate
    34	      expanded memory so that programs and device drivers may be loaded into
    35	      the upper memory area.  Specifying RAM instead of NOEMS will establish a
    36	      64K page frame for expanded memory, and the reduced number of upper
    37	      memory blocks may be insufficient to allow the driver to be loaded high;
    38	      in this case, a commercial memory manager (QEMM386, 386MAX) may be
    39	      needed.  If the STACKER coprocessor card is installed, it will also be
    40	      necessary to exclude its address range (e.g., x=CC00-CFFF).
    41	
    42	      4) DEVICEHIGH=C:\STACKER\STACKER.COM... does the actual loading of the
    43	      STACKER device driver into the upper memory area.  If there is
    44	      insufficient memory available, DOS will load the driver into conventional
    45	      memory with no warning message.
    46	
    47	      5) The DOS command MEM/C lists the order and size in which drivers and
    48	      programs have been loaded.
    49	
    50	
    51	  RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
    52	      1) Ensure that the statements are executed in CONFIG.SYS in proper order.
    53	      (Note that they need not be consecutive, and the paths may differ from
    54	      system to system):
    55	                      DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS
    56	                      DOS=HIGH,UMB
    57	                      DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE (NOEMS or RAM) (X=exclude range
    58	                          if applicable)
    59	                      DEVICEHIGH=C:\STACKER\STACKER.COM...
    60	
    61	      2) If boot drive is SSWAPped, ensure that a copy of HIMEM.SYS and
    62	      EMM386.EXE reside in the \DOS directory on the host volume; for instance,
    63	      if C: and D: are SSWAPped, then a copy of the files must reside in
    64	      D:\DOS.
