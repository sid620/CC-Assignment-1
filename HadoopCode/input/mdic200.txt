    11	
    12	     I feel that this dictionary fills a major void.  In my years 
    13	of using BBS's, I have never seen such a dictionary.  The closest 
    14	thing I've seen was a text file that had about 40 words listed.  
    15	These words included "RAM" "ROM" "Microcomputer" "Telex" and a 
    16	bunch of other words that aren't really that important to under-
    17	stand computer telecommunications.  I've seen some books about 
    18	"modeming" in bookstores, but they tend to be expensive ($15-
    19	$49), and I don't recall seeing any dictionaries of terms relat-
    20	ing to modems.  Also, many terms are easy to confuse and it can 
    21	be very difficult to find definitions for these terms.  I have 
    22	seen terms used incorrectly in advertisements by modem manufac-
    23	turers and in many, many magazine articles.  I hope that this 
    24	dictionary can be used as a good source of reference for confus-
    25	ing terms.
    26	
    27	     Why do I feel qualified to write a dictionary such as this?  
    28	I bought my first modem more than seven years ago and have been 
    29	using computers for twice as long.  Not only have I used many 
    30	different computers and modems, I have seen the days where 
    31	1200bps BBS's were rare because most people had 300bps modems.  
    32	For about a year I ran my own BBS, which was quite successful at 
    33	the time.  While I only had about 150K of storage for messages 
    34	and files, I was able to get over 500 users in that year.  I have 
    35	also gathered, read, and searched through hundreds of text files, 
    36	magazines, and program documentation, just to help define words 
    37	and find new words for this dictionary.  I have also spoken to 
    38	representatives of major companies to help find out the truth 
    39	behind the more confusing terms.

    46	     This dictionary is provided with no warranty of any kind.  
    47	The author and/or distributor will not be liable for any conse-
    48	quences resulting from the use of this information.  This is a 
    49	field where misconceptions abound.  Although to the best of my 
    50	knowledge all information is accurate, I can not guarantee its 
    51	accuracy.

    55	                              NOTES
    56	
    57	
    58	Note 1:  It was difficult to decide what words to include and 
    59	what words not to include.  I tried to include every term relat-
    60	ing to computer telecommunications that the average user needs to 
    61	know, or might come across and be curious about.  Some words 
    62	(such as PSK) are easily found in manuals for modems, but are 
    63	hard to find definitions for.  I tried to include as many of 
    64	these as possible.
    65	
    66	Note 2:  Since there are so many words defined here, and many of 
    67	them are complex and easily misunderstood, I wouldn't be sur-
    68	prised if there are a couple errors of some sort.  I tried to be 
    69	as careful as I could, but it is possible that there may be some 
    70	mistakes.  If you notice any mistakes, or have suggestions of 
    71	words to add (or take out), please let me know.  I correct all 
    72	known mistakes in future version.
    73	
    74	Note 3: Check out the appendixes at the end of the file!  They 
    75	contain a list of Emoticons :) and another list containing abbre-
    76	viations (such as BTW and CUL8R).

   109	
   110	
   111	     I've obviously put in countless hours over the past 6 years 
   112	creating this dictionary.  Just searching through new articles 
   113	and information to find new words takes hours.
   114	
   115	     As mentioned above, this dictionary is being marketed as 
   116	freeware.  Feel free to use it as much as you want.  However, if 
   117	you find that you are benefiting from it, I'd appreciate a quick 
   118	note or postcard saying so.
   119	
   120	     I'd also love to hear how you are using this dictionary.  
   121	Since its first public release in 1989, the dictionary has been 
   122	used:  in training courses run by modem manufacturers; as a 
   123	reference for term papers for school; as a reference for an 
   124	article and a speech for Bar Associations; by SysOps for new user 
   125	messages; and more.  It has also been praised by Uncle Hanks 
   126	Shareware Review Newsletter (May '93).

   141	Hopefully, at some point there will be a BBS to call to get the 
   142	latest version of the Telecommunications Dictionary, as well as 
   143	to use as an easy way to contact me.
   144	
   145	
   146	I hope you enjoy this dictionary!

   151	                     Notes about the entries
   152	                     ----- ----- --- -------
   153	
   154	* [Also called <entry>] and [Same as <entry>] mean that there are 
   155	more than one word for a certain concept.  Do not bother looking 
   156	at <entry>, it will just refer you back to the original entry.
   157	
   158	* [See also <entry>] at the end of a definition refers you to 
   159	more information or an entry that may help you understand the 
   160	original entry better.  Also, a word and it's opposite will often 
   161	refer to each another.
   162	
   163	* [See <entry>] appearing directly after the term indicates that 
   164	the definition is the same as <entry>, and you should look there.
   165	
   166	* BBS is used here generically to denote any service that you can 
   167	call up with your computer, whether it is a bulletin board, a pay 
   168	service, or even a mainframe.
   169	
   170	* Some entries refer to computers in general, but an understand-
   171	ing of them is sometimes needed to understand other entries.

   181	
   182	
   183	---Numbers---
   184	
   185	
   186	
   187	8N1 - The most common modem format.  [See also format].
   188	
   189	42A Block - This is a box about two inches square, with a modular 
   190	jack, that separates the wires coming from the phone company.  
   191	You can plug a phone or modem into this jacking, using a modular 
   192	cord.  [See also modular cord, modular jack, modular plug].
   193	
   194	103 - Officially, `Bell 103' which is the standard controlling
   195	transmission at 300 bps in the United States.  It was created by
   196	AT&T.  [See also 212A, V.21].
   197	
   198	212A - Officially, `Bell 212A' which is the standard controlling 
   199	transmission at 1200 bps in the United States.  It was created by 
   200	AT&T.  [See also 103, V.22].
   201	
   202	300 bps (baud) - A transmission speed that is now almost never 
   203	used, although most modems will allow communication at the speed 
   204	(since it was common in the early 1980's).  It is roughly equal 
   205	to 30 characters per second.
   206	
   207	1200 bps (baud) - In the mid 1980s this was the most common 
   208	transmission speed, until 2400 bps became popular/cheaper.  It is 
   209	roughly equal to 120 characters per second.
   210	
   211	2400 bps (baud) - A fairly high-speed transmission speed that 
   212	towards the end of the 1980s gained popularity.  It is roughly 
   213	equal to 240 characters per second.
   214	
   215	3400 hertz - The highest pitch that a telephone line will trans-
   216	mit.  This cutoff limits the ways in which computers can communi-
   217	cate over telephone lines.
   218	
   219	8250 UART - The UART used for the communications ports on most 
   220	older computers.  [See also UART].
   221	
   222	9600 bps (baud) - This, along with 14,400 bps are the 2 standard 
   223	speeds for high-speed modems.  It can transmit and receive ap-
   224	proximately 960 characters per second (without compression).
   225	
   226	14400 bps - Currently, the fastest standard speed for high-speed 
   227	modems.
   228	
   229	28800 bps - The highest speed obtainable using the proposed 
   230	V.fast standard.
   231	
   232	16450 UART - The UART used with some 286 computers.  [See also 
   233	UART].
   234	
   235	16550 UART - This is the UART used with most newer computers and 
   236	high speed modems.  There are several variations, but they all 
   237	include one main feature: they include buffering, so that if data 
   238	comes in or is sent faster than the computer/modem can accept it, 
   239	the UART will hold the data (up to 16 bytes) until the 
   240	computer/modem is ready for it.  [See also UART].
   241	
   242	16550A UART - See 16550 UART.
   243	
   244	16550AF UART - See 16550 UART.
   245

   251	
   252	
   253	
   254	abort - [1] The command word used with editors that allows you to 
   255	exit, destroying your message.  [2] The character used to stop 
   256	characters from a block of text appearing on your screen.  Usual-
   257	ly the spacebar or CTRL-X are used to abort a message.
   258	
   259	access - Refers to an intangible amount (usually represented by a 
   260	security level or flags) that indicate to what extent you are 
   261	allowed to use a BBS.  When used in a term such as `you will be 
   262	granted access', it means the amount of access that new users 
   263	will generally receive.
   264	
   265	account - A term that refers to information that a BBS has about 
   266	you.  It is usually referred to by an ID number or your name.  
   267	The information it contains can include any information that you 
   268	have at some point given the BBS, usually including your name, 
   269	phone number, and security level.  [See also user number].
   270	
   271	account number - See user number.
   272	
   273	Acculink - A packet switched network that is used to save money 
   274	on long-distance telecommunications.
   275	
   276	ACK - A character (CTRL-F) that ACKnowledges something, usually 
   277	that a certain amount of data has been received correctly.  [See 
   278	also NAK].
   279	
   280	acoustic coupler - This was common many years ago, but rare now.  
   281	It is a cradle in which you would place the handset of a phone.  
   282	This would be connected to a modem, and the modem would access 
   283	the phone line through this coupler.  Modern modems connect 
   284	directly to the phone line.  [See also acoustic modem].
   285	
   286	acoustic modem - A modem that uses an acoustic coupler.  [See
   287	also acoustic coupler].
   288	
   289	adaptive data compression - See ADC.
   290	
   291	adaptive dialing - When a modem can determine whether to dial
   292	pulse or tone.  It will try dialing with tones first.  If that
   293	doesn't work, it will dial pulse.
   294	
   295	adaptive equalization - Modems that have this feature "listen" to 
   296	the phone line to find the bandwidth with the least noise, and 
   297	use that part of the band for transmission.  This allows for less 
   298	interference from noise.
   299	
   300	ADC - Adaptive Data Compression.  A method of data compression
   301	developed by Hayes, with a possible compression ratio of 2:1.
   302	
   303	address - Similar to a physical mailing address, an address lets 
   304	people know how you can be reached on a network.  It may consist 
   305	of numbers or words, for example, 1:212/113 or joe@usc.edu.  [See 
   306	also matrix address, network address].
   307	
   308	alias - A name that users can use on a bulletin board that is not 
   309	their own.  Aliases are usually used by young BBS users and those 
   310	who pirate software or do other illegal activities.  Some exam-
   311	ples of aliases are `Cracker Kid', `Starbuck', and `Midnight 
   312	Killer'.  [Also called handle].  [See also user name].
   313	
   314	America On-line - A commercial on-line service.
   315	
   316	ampersand - A character (&) that usually means `and'.
   317	
   318	analog - As far as electronic signals are concerned, analog 
   319	refers to signals that can represent an infinite range of num-
   320	bers, as opposed to digital which can only be distinct whole 
   321	numbers.  Analog data often comes from measurements.  The sound a 
   322	modem makes over the phone is analog since it can be any of a 
   323	number of different frequencies.  [See also digital].
   324	
   325	anonymous - Refers to a message, where the author was able to 
   326	leave out his name.  On some BBS's you are allowed to post anony-
   327	mous messages so that others won't know who you are.  The SysOp 
   328	usually can find out who the author is, however.
   329	
   330	ANSI - ANSI is an organization that sets standards.  ANSI graph-
   331	ics, however, is a set of cursor control codes which originated 
   332	on the VT100 smart terminal.  Many BBS's use these codes to help 
   333	improve the sending of characters to communications programs.  It 
   334	uses the escape character, followed by other characters, which 
   335	allows movement of the cursor on the screen, a change of color, 
   336	and more.
   337	
   338	answering computer - This is the computer that is being called.  
   339	Therefore, it is usually the BBS or mainframe. [See also origi-
   340	nating computer].
   341	
   342	answering machine - See voice mail.
   343	
   344	answer frequency - The frequency of the carrier that a modem uses 
   345	when it has been called by another computer.  [See also originate 
   346	frequency].
   347	
   348	answer mode - When a modem is ready to pick up the phone when it 
   349	rings.  After picking up the phone, the modem will attempt to 
   350	make a connection with another modem.  All BBS's are in answer 
   351	mode.  [See also originate mode].
   352	
   353	apostrophe - The character '.  It is usually used in contractions
   354	of words, such as "don't".
   355	
   356	ARC - When a filename has the extension ARC, it means that it is 
   357	an archive that has been compressed with the program PKARC.  To 
   358	get the files out of the archive, you need to use the program 
   359	PKXARC.  You should be able to find this program on many BBS's.  
   360	[See also archive, unarchive].
   361	
   362	archive - [noun] A group of programs that are together, usually 
   363	compressed, in one file.  [verb] the process of combining those 
   364	files.  There are a number of software packages which will com-
   365	press files into an archive, and most programs on BBS's have been 
   366	archived with one of these software packages.  [See also unar-
   367	chive, compress, ZIP, ARJ, ARC, PAK, LZH].
   368	
   369	area code - The 3-digit number used by the telephone company to 
   370	designate a geographic area.  Each state in the United States has 
   371	1 or more area codes.  If you call a phone number in a different 
   372	area code, you must dial "1" and then the area code before the 
   373	phone number.  If you call a number within your area code, you 
   374	just dial the phone number (if it is long distance within your 
   375	area code, you must dial "1" and then the number).
   376	
   377	ARJ - [1] A file extension that indicates that the file was com-
   378	pressed with the program ARJ.  [2] The program ARJ, used to 
   379	archive and un-archive files with the ARJ extension.  [See also 
   380	archive, unarchive].
   381	
   382	ARPA-NET - The network from which Internet was formed.
   383	
   384	ASCII - An acronym for American Standard Code of Information 
   385	Interchange.  It uses 7 bits to represent all uppercase and 
   386	lowercase characters, as well as numbers, punctuation marks, and 
   387	other characters.  ASCII often uses 8 bits in the form of bytes 
   388	and ignores the first bit.  [See also EBCDIC].
   389	
   390	ASCII transfer - When a text file is sent directly as it is, 
   391	without any special codes.
   392	
   393	asterisk - The character *.
   394	
   395	asynchronous communication - This is when the beginning and end
   396	of each byte that is sent over the phone lines is marked somehow.
   397	This way, if there is line noise, the modem can find out right
   398	away where the next byte should start.  [See also synchronous
   399	communication].
   400	
   401	AT command - Any instructions sent to a modem that begin with 
   402	"AT".  See also Hayes AT command set.
   403	
   404	AT command set - See Hayes AT command set.
   405	
   406	at sign - The character @.  Often read as 'at'.
   407	
   408	AT&T - American Telephone and Telegraph, the inventors of the 
   409	first modem.
   410	
   411	attended mode - This is the mode that a communications program is 
   412	in while you are operating it.  [See also unattended mode].
   413	
   414	attention characters - The letters "AT", which get the modem's 
   415	attention that you are about to send it a command.  [See also 
   416	Hayes AT command set].
   417	
   418	audio monitor - A speaker that is included as part of a modem.  
   419	It allows you to listen to whatever sound is on the phone line.  
   420	This is often used to let you hear busy signals or make sure that 
   421	the other modem picks up the carrier.
   422	
   423	auto-answer - When a modem has the ability to automatically pick 
   424	up the phone when the phone rings and then attempt to connect 
   425	with another computer.
   426	
   427	auto-answer LED - When this LED (found on some external modems) 
   428	lights up, it means that the modem is ready to answer the phone 
   429	when the phone rings (it will then try to connect to another 
   430	modem).  If it is not lit, the modem will not answer the phone.  
   431	[See also LED indicators].
   432	
   433	auto-baud detect - The ability of a modem to change to a lower 
   434	bps rate if the computer it is calling is unable to communicate 
   435	at the requested speed.
   436	
   437	auto-dial - When a modem is capable of dialing a phone number, so 
   438	that you don't have to dial manually.  Almost all modems have 
   439	this ability.
   440	
   441	auto-download - The feature of some file transfer protocols 
   442	whereby a BBS can automatically make your communications program 
   443	start a download or upload (if your communications program has 
   444	this capability too).  This saves some time for the user, who 
   445	would otherwise have to set up his program to upload or download.
   446	
   447	auto fall-back - See fall-back.
   448	
   449	auto-kill - A feature on some BBS's that will delete a message on
   450	a board if a certain threshold limit is reached.  For example, a
   451	BBS might delete the second message on a board if there are
   452	already 100 messages and someone posts another message.  This 
   453	would limit the board to 100 messages, but still keep the first 
   454	message (which is usually left by the SysOp).
   455	
   456	auto-redial - A feature that allows a modem or a communications 
   457	program to dial a number again after it finds out that the number 
   458	is busy.  This is very handy when trying to get through to popu-
   459	lar bulletin boards that are often busy.
   460	
   461	auto-reliable - The ability of a modem to be able to communicate 
   462	both with modems that do have error-control and/or data compres-
   463	sion, and those that do not.
   464	
   465	auto-reply - To send a message (either public or private) immedi-
   466	ately after reading a message on a BBS.  Usually, this is used to 
   467	respond to the author of the original message.
   468	
   469	auto-syncing driver - This is the part of a BBS program that 
   470	automatically determines the bps rate of a caller.  [See also 
   471	manual-syncing driver].
   472	
   473	auto-typing - This is when a communications program can upload 
   474	information to a BBS as if the user were typing in the informa-
   475	tion.  For example, the user might type a message into a file, 
   476	and then the communications program can send it to a BBS (which 
   477	assumes the user is actually typing the message) to post as a 
   478	message.
   479	
   480	
   481	
   482	---B---
   483	
   484	
   485	
   486	backdoor - A way of getting into certain BBS's and getting full 
   487	access, without using a regular account.  Usually the author of 
   488	the BBS program built the backdoor into the program so that he 
   489	could get access to any BBS running his software.  Backdoors are 
   490	less common today than they used to be.
   491	
   492	background send/receive - The ability of a fax/modem to send or 
   493	receive faxes while the computer is being used for other pur-
   494	poses.
   495	
   496	backslash - The character \.
   497	
   498	backspace - The character (CTRL-H) that causes the cursor on your
   499	screen to move back one space.  [See also destructive backspace,
   500	non-destructive backspace].
   501	
   502	bandwidth - A range of radio, audio, or other frequencies.  
   503	Telephone lines have a bandwidth from 300 hertz to 3400 hertz.  
   504	Since it is so limited, a modem must carefully change data into 
   505	sounds that "fit" within this range.  Similar to frequency spec-
   506	trum.
   507	
   508	bannerware - A software program that is free to use and copy, but 
   509	advertises another program or product.  [See also public domain].
   510	
   511	batch file transfer - This is when more than one file is sent at 
   512	a time by a file transfer protocol.  The user will tell the BBS 
   513	what files he wants, and then the BBS will send all the files 
   514	before the user needs to do anything else.
   515	
   516	baud - A term referring to the speed at which modems communicate.  
   517	Technically, it is the number of changes in an electronic signal 
   518	per second.  Since the number of changes used to be the same as 
   519	the number of bits sent or received per second, bps and baud are 
   520	often used interchangeably.  However, there is a difference, 
   521	which is very often confused.  For example, many 1200bps modems 
   522	were advertised as 1200 baud, even though they operate at 600 
   523	baud.  They send out 2 bits 600 times a second, which means that 
   524	it is 600 baud.  However, since it is so often misunderstood, you 
   525	can assume that when you see "baud" it means bits per second, 
   526	unless it is stated otherwise.  The term comes from the scientist 
   527	J. M. E. Baudot.  [See also bps, dibit].
   528	
   529	BBS - An acronym for Bulletin Board System.  Usually it is a home 
   530	computer that has a modem attached and is waiting for calls from 
   531	other computers.  It can, however, also refer to commercial serv-
   532	ices (such as CompuServe and Prodigy) and any other computers 
   533	that you can call via telephone lines. BBS's almost always allow 
   534	you to leave messages for other users.  Most BBS's have programs 
   535	that you can download and use on your computer.  BBS can also be 
   536	expanded more simply to `bulletin board'.
   537	
   538	BCC - Block Check Character.  This is used to help make sure that 
   539	a group of data has not been accidentally altered.
   540	
   541	Bell 103 - See 103.
   542	
   543	Bell 212A - See 212A.
   544	
   545	bisync - Refers to a modem that synchronizes with an electronic 
   546	signal over the telephone lines that marks the beginning of 
   547	blocks of data.  It is one of a number of synchronous protocols.
   548	
   549	bit - A Binary digIT.  It is a number in base 2 (binary), which 
   550	means that it can only be a 0 or a 1.  It is used in the expres-
   551	sion `bits per second'.  [See also byte].
   552	
   553	bitstream - BBS's and related activities.  For example, you could 
   554	say that a lot of public domain programs can be found in the 
   555	bitstream.
   556	
   557	blind dial - This is when a modem will dial a number without 
   558	waiting for a dial tone.  Some long-distance telephone services 
   559	require a number to be dialed, even though there is no dial tone.  
   560	In this case, your modem should be set to blind dial.
   561	
   562	block - A group of data bytes.  For example, when downloading a 
   563	program, blocks of 128 or 1024 characters are often sent.
   564	
   565	block check character - See BCC.
   566	
   567	block size - This term, when used with either error control or 
   568	data compression protocols, refers to the number of characters to 
   569	be sent at one time.  If error control is used, the codes are 
   570	sent immediately following this block.  Typical block sizes are 
   571	64, 128, 192, or 256 characters.  Small block sizes are better 
   572	when the line quality is bad (such as for long distance calls), 
   573	while large block sizes are better during good connections (such 
   574	as for local calls).
   575	
   576	board - [1] See BBS.  [2] See message base.
   577	
   578	bps - Bits Per Second.  The transmission speed of most modems is 
   579	measured in baud or bps.  Bps is literally the number of bits 
   580	sent by the modem every second.  [See also baud].
   581	
   582	braces - The characters { and }.  [See also left brace, right 
   583	brace].
   584	
   585	brackets - The characters [ and ].  [See also left bracket, right 
   586	bracket].
   587	
   588	break signal - This is a signal sent from one modem to another 
   589	that lasts for about a second.  It is sometimes used to try to 
   590	clear up synchronization problems.  On CCITT V.42 modems, there 
   591	are more specialized procedures involved with the break signal, 
   592	such as regarding the timing.  In V.42 there are three kinds of 
   593	break signals.  [See also expedited signaling, destructive sig-
   594	naling, in sequence signaling].
   595	
   596	browse - To go through the list of titles of messages or files on 
   597	a BBS and note which ones you want to read.  On some BBS's, you 
   598	can search through the messages and look for specific words.  
   599	This can be handy if there are lots of messages, and you do not 
   600	want to go through them all.
   601	
   602	buffer - [1] (verb) To save all incoming data in memory.  [2] 
   603	(verb) to temporarily save incoming data until the computer has a 
   604	chance to process it.  [3] (noun) The place in memory where the 
   605	saved information is stored, as in "I have a 32K buffer."
   606	
   607	bulk mailing - Used on a BBS when you send the same message to 
   608	more than one person.  This saves you from having to rewrite the 
   609	message.  [See also E-mail].
   610	
   611	bulletin - A special message posted on a BBS, usually written by 
   612	the SysOp.  In most cases all users are expected to read any new 
   613	bulletins that may have been posted since their last call.
   614	
   615	bulletin board - [1] See BBS. [2] Sometimes same as message base.
   616	
   617	bulletin board system - See BBS.
   618	
   619	busy - When a bulletin board is being used by as many users as it 
   620	can handle, which is when all the telephone lines are being used.
   621	
   622	busy signal - The sound that you hear on a phone when the phone 
   623	number you are trying to reach is in use (busy).  It usually 
   624	consists of 60 cycles per minute.  [See also audio monitor].
   625	
   626	byte - A group of 8 bits.  It usually represents one character.
   627	[See also ASCII].
   628	
   629	
   630	
   631	---C---
   632	
   633	
   634	
   635	call back unit - A device that can be attached to the phone line 
   636	of a BBS to make it more secure.  After you connect with the BBS 
   637	and tell it who you are, the device will then call your phone 
   638	number.  This is used to make a very secure system to help pre-
   639	vent hackers from invading a system.  It then becomes very diffi-
   640	cult, if not impossible, for a hacker to get into the computer 
   641	system.
   642	
   643	caller - Anyone who connects with a BBS.  It is usually used in a 
   644	phrase such as "You are caller #4328."
   645	
   646	caller I.D. - A code that is sent over the phone lines in some 
   647	areas when a person makes a phone call.  This code includes the 
   648	phone number of the person making the call.  Some modems are able 
   649	to understand this signal, and let you know who is calling you 
   650	before you answer the phone.
   651	
   652	caller log - A list of callers who have called a BBS within a 
   653	given time period.  The list may also keep information such as 
   654	the bps rate of the caller.  This is used so that the SysOp can 
   655	keep track of users, as well as any hackers, if they call the 
   656	BBS.
   657	
   658	call progress monitoring - This is when your modem tells you what 
   659	is happening when you dial another computer.  It will tell you 
   660	that it has dialed the number, if the number is busy, if you 
   661	connect, etc.
   662	
   663	call waiting - A service that the phone company offers that 
   664	allows the customer to hear a special sound on the phone if there 
   665	is an incoming call while the customer is talking on the phone.  
   666	The customer can then talk with either caller.  This is a nice 
   667	service unless you have a modem and call BBS's.  If you are 
   668	connected with a BBS and someone else calls you, you will be 
   669	disconnected.  In most areas there is a special 2 or 3 digit 
   670	number that you can dial before a phone call that will disconnect 
   671	call waiting for that call.  If you have call waiting, check your 
   672	phonebook or call the phone company to find out how to disconnect 
   673	call waiting.
   674	
   675	capital letters - See uppercase.
   676	
   677	capture - To 'catch' text that is being sent to your computer 
   678	from a BBS and put it in a buffer or a file.
   679	
   680	capture buffer - The area in a computer's memory where a communi-
   681	cations program stores incoming data that is to be saved.  [Also 
   682	called capture memory].  [See also buffer].
   683	
   684	capture memory - See capture buffer.
   685	
   686	card (peripheral) - Any computer peripheral that can be connected 
   687	directly, inside a computer.  Internal modems are usually periph-
   688	eral cards.
   689	
   690	caret - The character ^.
   691	
   692	carriage return - See return.
   693	
   694	carrier - The tone that the modem sends over the phone lines 
   695	before any data is sent on it.  It has a fixed frequency and a 
   696	fixed amplitude.  It is then modified to indicate data.
   697	
   698	carrier detect - The wire in an RS-232C cable that holds the 
   699	information as to whether or not the modem senses a carrier (and 
   700	therefore is connected to another computer).  [Also called CD].
   701	
   702	carrier detect threshold - A way of measuring how well a modem
   703	can detect valid data over noisy phone lines.  It is measured in
   704	negative dBm's (decibel-milliwatts).  The bigger the number (the
   705	more negative) the better.  For example, -45 dBm is better than
   706	-40 dBm.  [Same as receive sensitivity].
   707	
   708	carrier detect LED - This LED will light up on an external modem 
   709	when it senses a carrier on the phone line.  This indicates that 
   710	the modem is connected to another modem.  [See also LED indica-
   711	tors].
   712	
   713	carrier frequency - This is the frequency which a modem uses to
   714	transmit or receive data.
   715	
   716	carrier loss time - The amount of time your modem will remain on 
   717	the line when the carrier is lost.  It will stay on the line for 
   718	this amount of time, to see if the carrier comes back.  If the 
   719	carrier does not come back, the modem will hang up the phone 
   720	line.
   721	
   722	CAS - Communications Applications Specification.  This is a 
   723	standard for fax communications.  The other fax standards are 
   724	class 1, class 2, and class 3.  [See also class 1, 2, 3].
   725	
   726	CB simulator - A computer service where there are multiple phone 
   727	lines (usually at least 5).  The CB simulator allows all the 
   728	users to send messages to one another while they are on-line.  It 
   729	usually allows you to send both public messages that everyone who 
   730	is on-line can see and private messages that only one specific 
   731	user can see.
   732	
   733	CCITT - International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Com-
   734	mittee.  This group, created by the United Nations, establishes 
   735	certain standards for data transmission.  Their transmission, 
   736	data compression, and error control standards all begin with V, 
   737	for example V.22.  To find the standards in this dictionary, look 
   738	up the standard name, i.e. V.42.  Note that this organization is 
   739	now referred to as ITU-TSS.  [See also ITU-TSS].
   740	
   741	CD - See carrier detect.
   742	
   743	character - Any letter, numeral or symbol.  [See also ASCII].
   744	
   745	character format - See format.
   746	
   747	characters per second - The number of bytes or characters that 
   748	can be sent over the phone lines in 1 second.  This is determined 
   749	by dividing the bps rate by the number of bits it takes to send 
   750	one byte (usually 10--the start bit, 8 bits of data, and the stop 
   751	bit).  So, a 2400bps modem can send 240 characters per second 
   752	(2400/10).  [Same as CPS].
   753	
   754	chat - A mode that allows two or more people (almost always a 
   755	SysOp and a user on a BBS) to communicate directly with each 
   756	other using the modem.  Usually, each person can see what the 
   757	other is typing at all times and can interrupt them (a beeping 
   758	sound with a CTRL-G is useful to interrupt with).  [See also page 
   759	(verb)].
   760	
   761	chat mode - This is when a communications program is set up so 
   762	that the user can "chat" with someone on the other end of the 
   763	line.  One way this can work is that anything that is typed by 
   764	the other person is printed on the top half of the screen, but 
   765	anything you type would appear on the bottom half of the screen.  
   766	[See also chat].
   767	
   768	checksum - A number that represents a larger group of numbers in 
   769	order to check for errors in data transmission.  It is commonly 
   770	used when downloading a program, as well as in error control 
   771	protocols.  The checksum is the result of a mathematical equa-
   772	tion, such as adding all the numbers in a block together (al-
   773	though it is usually more complex than that).
   774	
   775	chip set - A group of important IC chips on a modem (or other 
   776	computer peripheral) that are all made by the same manufacturer.  
   777	While there are many companies that make modems, there are only a 
   778	few that make the chips for them.  Because the chip manufacturer 
   779	is making the chips for many companies, they produce more chips, 
   780	and the price of the chips is lower than if each company produced 
   781	their own.  This decreases the price of the modems on the market.
   782	
   783	Christensen protocol - See Xmodem.
   784	
   785	CIM - CompuServe Information Manager.  This is a program created 
   786	by CompuServe which is supposed to make it easier to use Compu-
   787	Serve.
   788	
   789	circular dialing queue - This is used in some communications 
   790	programs to allow you to enter a list of phone numbers to call, 
   791	and it will keep going through the list and dialing numbers until 
   792	it reaches one of them.  This is useful if you are trying to 
   793	reach BBS's that are often busy.
   794	
   795	CIS - Compuserve Information Service.  See CompuServe.
   796	
   797	city code - With many foreign countries, you need to dial a city 
   798	code before the phone number you are trying to reach.  You must 
   799	dial the country code before the city code.  The city code will 
   800	be from 1 to 5 digits.  [See also country code].
   801	
   802	class 1, 2, 3 - Fax standards.  [See also CAS].
   803	
   804	clear to send - See CTS.
   805	
   806	columns - A measurement of the width of your screen as measured 
   807	by the number of characters your screen can fit across it.  BBS's 
   808	often ask for your screen width.  Most computers have a screen 
   809	width of 80 columns.
   810	
   811	COM port - IBM and compatible computers have the ability to hook  
   812	up devices (such as modems and mice) to the computer, through 
   813	ports.  These ports are called COM ports, and are numbered 1-8.  
   814	While all 8 could be used, usually only #1 and #2 are used, while 
   815	#3 and #4 are used occasionally.  [See also selectable COM port].
   816	
   817	comm program - See communications program.
   818	
   819	command buffer - The place in your modem's memory where it stores 
   820	the commands that you give it.  [See also buffer].
   821	
   822	command echo - When this is on, any AT command sent to the modem 
   823	will then be sent back from the modem to the computer.  For 
   824	example, if you were to type "ATS11=40," the modem would act on 
   825	the command, and then send "ATS11=40" back to the computer.
   826	
   827	command mode - This is when your modem interprets what you type 
   828	as commands, rather than just sending the data over the phone 
   829	line.  [See also data mode, terminal mode, voice mode].
   830	
   831	command set - A list of all the possible commands that you can 
   832	give something, such as a modem, a BASIC program, or a BBS.  [See 
   833	also Hayes AT command set].
   834	
   835	commands - Instructions that you can give to a modem, a BBS, or 
   836	another similar device.
   837	
   838	commercial host system - An on-line system that you can call up, 
   839	that is operated by a company that charges you to use it.
   840	
   841	commercial software - Software that is copyrighted and may not 
   842	legally be distributed by BBS's or copied and given to other 
   843	users.  [See also public domain, copyright].
   844	
   845	communication - The idea of transferring one's thoughts or ideas 
   846	to another person.  This can be through speaking, radio, T.V., 
   847	telephones, mail, etc.
   848	
   849	Communications Applications Specification - See CAS.
   850	
   851	communications program - A program that controls a modem, and has 
   852	features that allow the user to do such things as upload, down-
   853	load, etc.  It is similar to a terminal program but more sophis-
   854	ticated.  It used to be used interchangeably with terminal pro-
   855	gram.  [Same as comm program].
   856	
   857	compatible - When one object can work just like another.  Al-
   858	though the term is usually used with computers, it is often used 
   859	with modems.  Many modems are compatible with other popular 
   860	modems.  [See also V.42 compatible].
   861	
   862	compliant - See V.42 compliant.
   863	
   864	compress - To make data take up less space.  Archiving programs 
   865	do this, which means that files will take less time to transfer 
   866	with modems.  Many modems now have the ability to automatically 
   867	compress the information they send and receive.  [See also ar-
   868	chive, data compression].
   869	
   870	compression ratio - The ratio of the original size of data that 
   871	is sent to the compressed size.  For example, a 3:1 compression 
   872	ratio means that the original data takes up 3 times the amount of 
   873	space as the compressed data, and a modem would transfer the data 
   874	3 times more quickly than if it was not compressed.
   875	
   876	CompuServe - The first major commercial on-line service.
   877	
   878	CompuServe Information Service (CIS) - See CompuServe.
   879	
   880	computer network - See LAN.
   881	
   882	conference - A group of related messages on a BBS.  Often, many 
   883	BBS's are linked together for a conference (so that all users on 
   884	all the BBS's see the messages and can reply to them).  For 
   885	example, there may be a conference just on Windows.  [Same as 
   886	forum].
   887	
   888	configure - To set something to your liking.  To configure a BBS, 
   889	you may have to tell it your screen width, whether you need line 
   890	feeds and other such information.
   891	
   892	configuration - Configuration is the information describing what 
   893	your computer's hardware and software is like, so that a BBS can 
   894	send information properly.  For example, you need to tell a BBS 
   895	how wide your screen is.
   896	
   897	connect - [1] To get to a point where you can start communicating 
   898	with a BBS, as in "I have connected with the BBS."  [2] Any point 
   899	after you have established contact with a BBS, as in "I am still 
   900	connected with the BBS" or "I have been connected with the bulle-
   901	tin board for just over an hour."
   902	
   903	connect speed - The speed, in bps, which your modem uses when it 
   904	connects with a BBS.  This speed will depend on the speed of your 
   905	modem, and the BBS's modem.  It will be no higher than the lower 
   906	of the two speeds.  If you have a 2400bps modem, and call a 
   907	1200bps BBS, your connect speed should be 1200bps.
   908	
   909	connection - The actual contact with a BBS.  It is used most 
   910	often in expressions such as "I have a bad connection," meaning 
   911	that there is line noise.
   912	
   913	control character - Any of the 32 ASCII characters that do not 
   914	print on your screen or printer.  These characters are usually 
   915	used to control your computer.  [See also CTRL].
   916	
   917	copyright - A term meaning that a program or text file is pro-
   918	tected by the government so that it may not legally be copied, 
   919	except to make backup copies, or as specified by the author of 
   920	the program.  You should not upload a copyrighted program to a 
   921	BBS, unless it is shareware or freeware.  [See shareware, free-
   922	ware].
   923	
   924	Co-SysOp - A term similar to a vice president.  The Co-SysOp of a 
   925	BBS has more access to the BBS than any other user except the 
   926	SysOp.  The Co-SysOp might check messages to make sure that they 
   927	are suitable for the BBS (not containing illegal messages), and 
   928	he may be able to validate users.  Sometimes a Co-SysOp is just a 
   929	title given to someone who helped the BBS a lot by doing things 
   930	such as posting messages and uploading.  Also, many times there 
   931	is more than one Co-SysOp.  [See also SysOp].
   932	
   933	country code - The code that the telephone company uses to desig-
   934	nate a certain country.  If you need to call a BBS (or a person) 
   935	in a foreign country, you need to dial the country code, then 
   936	usually the city code, and then the local phone number.  The 
   937	country code will be 2 to 3 digits.  [See also city code].
   938	
   939	CPS - See characters per second.
   940	
   941	<CR> - Carriage Return.  See return.
   942	
   943	CRC - Stands for Cyclic Redundancy Check.  CRC is a system to 
   944	make sure that a block of data (usually from a downloaded pro-
   945	gram) is as free from error as possible.  It is usually 16 or 32 
   946	bits long (CRC-16 and CRC-32 respectively).
   947	
   948	crash - When a BBS is harmed in such a way that it is temporarily 
   949	inoperable.  The usual cause is that some files are destroyed, 
   950	either by accident or by a hacker.  Some people try to crash 
   951	BBS's, a fact that most users (and especially SysOps) think is 
   952	sad.
   953	
   954	crash recovery - This feature of some file transfer protocols 
   955	allows a user to continue a download or upload that had been 
   956	interrupted.  With this system, a user will not have to receive 
   957	the data that had already been sent before the disconnection, 
   958	which will save time.
   959	
   960	crippleware - This is software, usually distributed as shareware, 
   961	but it is not the complete program.  If it is a game, it might 
   962	only let you play the first level.  If it is a database program, 
   963	it might only let you have 50 entries (whereas the real version 
   964	would have more).  Some SysOps refuse to have programs on their 
   965	system that are crippled.
   966	
   967	cross-link - This occurs when 2 or more echos are joined togeth-
   968	er, either accidently or purposely.  If this happens, the joined 
   969	echos then contain the same messages.
   970	
   971	CRT - Cathode Ray Tube.  This is another name for a computer 
   972	monitor.
   973	
   974	CTRL - The abbreviation for ConTRoL.  This abbreviation is fol-
   975	lowed by a dash and then a character, such as CTRL-C, meaning the 
   976	control character C.  [See also control character].
   977	
   978	CTRL-G - The control character G, which usually causes the com-
   979	puter to produce a beeping sound.
   980	
   981	CTS - Clear To Send.  This is when the modem lets the other 
   982	computer know that it can send information to the other computer. 
   983	[See also flow control, RTS].
   984	
   985	CTS/RTS - The method of flow control that uses the CTS and RTS 
   986	signals.  It is built into the hardware, not software.  [See also 
   987	CTS, RTS, flow control].
   988	
   989	cursor - The marker that points out where text will next appear 
   990	on your screen.  It can be one of many things, usually a plain 
   991	white or flashing square, or an underline character.
   992	
   993	cyclic redundancy check - See CRC.
   994	
   995	cycling - When a light (such as the RD light) on an external 
   996	modem continuously turns on and off.
   997	
   998	
   999

  1005	Agency.
  1006	
  1007	dash - The character -.
  1008	
  1009	data - A group of characters that represents meaningful informa-
  1010	tion.  This information can be anything, ranging from bank ac-
  1011	count numbers to computer programs.  [See also information].
  1012	
  1013	database - [1] A program that keeps track of data, such as the 
  1014	information contained on mailing labels, or the price of stocks.  
  1015	[2] A large group of data.  The sum of the information that you 
  1016	can receive on extensive pay services such as CompuServe can be 
  1017	considered a database.
  1018	
  1019	database hack - A way that hackers attempt to gain access to 
  1020	someone's account on a BBS.  They create a list of common pass-
  1021	words (such as SECRET and MINE) and try every one on an account 
  1022	to see if it is the right password.  Because of this, an intelli-
  1023	gent BBS user will not use easy-to-guess passwords.
  1024	
  1025	data bits - [1] The number of bits that the modem uses to repre-
  1026	sent one byte.  This is usually 8, though it can be 7 since ASCII 
  1027	needs only 7 of the 8 bits.  [See also format].  [2] the actual 
  1028	bits within a byte being sent through the phone lines.
  1029	
  1030	data byte - A byte of information that is being sent over the 
  1031	phone lines.
  1032	
  1033	data carrier detect - See DCD.
  1034	
  1035	data communications equipment - See DCE.
  1036	
  1037	data compression - Some modems have the capability to 'squash' 
  1038	data so that it takes up less space.  When another modem (that 
  1039	also has this capability) receives the data, it 'unsquashes' the 
  1040	data to its original form.  By using data compression, a modem 
  1041	can send information faster.  It's a lot like shorthand--all the 
  1042	information is still there, but it takes less space and is quick-
  1043	er.  [See also MNP-5, V.42bis].
  1044	
  1045	data grade - A phone line that is set up by the phone company to
  1046	be more convenient for data communications.  It should have 
  1047	better electronic characteristics than a regular phone line.  
  1048	[See also voice grade].
  1049	
  1050	data mode - The mode that a modem is in where all information 
  1051	typed on the computer will be sent through the modem, and all 
  1052	information received by the modem will be placed on the screen.  
  1053	[See also command mode, terminal mode, voice mode].  [Same as 
  1054	on-line mode].

  1068	
  1069	data transmission rate - The speed at which data travels.  For 
  1070	example, data may be sent at 115,200bps.  [Same as transmission 
  1071	rate, transmission speed, data rate].  [See also bps].
  1072	
  1073	dB - See decibel.
  1074	
  1075	dBm - Decibel referred to one milliwatt.  This is used to measure 
  1076	certain levels, such as transmit level.  [See also transmit 
  1077	level, receive level, carrier detect threshold].
  1078	
  1079	DB-25 - The 25 pin plug that connects an RS-232C cable to the 
  1080	RS-232 port.
  1081	
  1082	DCD - Data Carrier Detect.  This tells the computer whether or 
  1083	not the modem is connected to another modem.
  1084	
  1085	DCE - Data Communications Equipment.  These are computer periph-
  1086	erals that communicate.  A modem is a DCE.  [See also DTE].
  1087	
  1088	decibel - A unit describing how loud one sound is compared to 
  1089	another.  [Same as dB].
  1090	
  1091	decompress - The process of converting compressed data back to 
  1092	its original form.  [See also archive].
  1093	
  1094	decoy program - A program or text sent on mainframes and multi-
  1095	line BBS's that simulates the log-on procedure.  The unsuspecting 
  1096	user will see this and enter his password, and the person who 
  1097	made the decoy program will get the password and can use the 
  1098	account.
  1099	
  1100	default - A setting or an answer to a question that is automati-
  1101	cally assumed.  If 80 columns is a default, then you only have to 
  1102	change it if you want something other than 80 columns.
  1103	
  1104	delay time - The time it takes between sending data on a computer 
  1105	and receiving a response from the remote computer.  If the delay 
  1106	is long, most file transfer protocols will slow down.  [See also 
  1107	protocol].
  1108	
  1109	Delphi - One of the major on-line services.  As of this writing, 
  1110	it does not support high speed modems.
  1111	
  1112	demodulate - To convert the tones that a modem sends over the 
  1113	phone lines back into data.  [See also modulate].
  1114	
  1115	department name - This is the last piece of information needed 
  1116	for an internet address.  [See also internet address].
  1117	
  1118	destructive backspace - A term that indicates that your communi-
  1119	cations program deletes the character the cursor is on when it 
  1120	receives the backspace character.  [See also non-destructive 
  1121	backspace].
  1122	
  1123	destructive signaling - This is a type of break signal that 
  1124	causes all data to be destroyed while the break signal is being 
  1125	sent.  [See also break signal].
  1126	
  1127	dial - To send out either the tones or pulses that the phone 
  1128	company needs to understand what number you are calling.  Most 
  1129	modems will dial automatically (auto-dial).
  1130	
  1131	dialing speed - See touchtone dialing speed.
  1132	
  1133	dialout facility - A service where you call a computer, and from 
  1134	that computer you can call other computers.  It is usually used 
  1135	with packet switching networks, which saves you money on long 
  1136	distance calls.
  1137	
  1138	dialup line - A telephone line connected to the telephone compa-
  1139	ny.  This is a regular phone line.  [Compare to leased line].

  1142	phone lines.
  1143	
  1144	dial modifiers - Any commands that are sent to a modem which 
  1145	change the way a phone number is dialed.  For example: tone, 
  1146	pulse, and pause.
  1147	
  1148	dial tone - The sound that you hear when you pick up the phone if 
  1149	it is ready to have an outgoing call made.  Your modem, if it can 
  1150	dial, should understand this tone.
  1151	
  1152	dibit - Two bits sent simultaneously by a modem.  For example, a 
  1153	modem can operate at 1200bps and 600 baud.  What happens in this 
  1154	case is that 600 times a second, the modem sends out a dibit (two 
  1155	bits).  Therefore, it is sending 1200 (600 times 2) bits per 
  1156	second.  [See also bps, baud].
  1157	
  1158	dictionary - The V.42bis data compression protocol stores certain 
  1159	data that is being sent/received in a "dictionary," which it 
  1160	refers to when compressing/decompressing data.  [See also 
  1161	V.42bis, dictionary size].  [Same as encoder dictionary].
  1162	
  1163	dictionary size - This is the number of characters in the dic-
  1164	tionary used for the V.42bis data compression protocol.  It is 
  1165	usually 2048, but can also be 1024, 512, or 4096.  [See also 
  1166	dictionary, V.42bis].
  1167	
  1168	digital - A system using discrete numbers to represent data.  In 
  1169	computer systems, these are the numbers 0 and 1 (for binary).  
  1170	[See also analog].
  1171	
  1172	digital signal processing - This is what is used to perform echo 
  1173	cancellation on a CCITT V.32/V.42 modem.  [Same as DSP].  [See 
  1174	also echo cancellation].
  1175	
  1176	DIP switch - DIP stands for Dual In-line Package.  DIP switches 
  1177	are a group of small switches placed together on electronic 
  1178	equipment.  Many modems have these.  The switches can be changed 
  1179	to alter various settings.  For example, one DIP switch on a 
  1180	modem may change the status of the DTR.
  1181	
  1182	direct mode - See MNP direct mode.
  1183	
  1184	disconnect - To hang up the phone and cause the connection be-
  1185	tween your modem and another computer to be stopped.  Most BBS 
  1186	programs have a way of disconnecting a user who has called the 
  1187	bulletin board, if it is needed.
  1188	
  1189	disk capture - This is when a communications program will save
  1190	incoming information to the disk.  This is useful if you are
  1191	receiving a text file that you want to read later.
  1192	
  1193	dither tone - See echo suppressor defeat tone.
  1194	
  1195	domain - The domain is the main category for an internet address.  
  1196	[See also domain name].
  1197	
  1198	domain name - This is the name for an internet domain.  The most 
  1199	common domains are COM (commercial), EDU (educational), and GOV 
  1200	(government).
  1201	
  1202	door - A gateway that will allow a bulletin board to run a pro-
  1203	gram while a user is on the BBS.  Games are popular doors on 
  1204	BBS's, although doors can be used for serious purposes, too.
  1205	
  1206	down - A word meaning that a bulletin board is not working, so 
  1207	that you can not connect with it.  This can mean that there was a 
  1208	crash, or it could simply mean that the SysOp is playing a game 
  1209	on his computer.  Often a SysOp will leave a phone connected to 
  1210	his BBS line off the hook when he is using the computer so that 
  1211	you will get a busy signal.  [See also running].
  1212	
  1213	download - To receive a computer file from a bulletin board.  It 
  1214	is usually a computer program, but can also be a text file.  [See 
  1215	also upload, protocol].
  1216	
  1217	DSP - See Digital Signal Processing.
  1218	
  1219	DSR - Data Set Ready.  This indicates that the modem is on, and 
  1220	ready to accept input from the computer (either commands or data 
  1221	to be sent over the phone line).  [Same as modem ready].
  1222	
  1223	DTE - Data Terminal Equipment.  This is computer equipment which 
  1224	is not directly responsible for communicating, for example, the 
  1225	computer itself and printers.  [See also DCE].
  1226	
  1227	DTMF - Dual Tone Multi-Frequency.  This is used in tone dialing.  
  1228	It is a method where 2 distinct tones are sent for each digit 
  1229	dialed.
  1230	
  1231	DTR - Stands for Data Terminal Ready.  The DTR signal is sent 
  1232	from the computer to the modem, to let the modem know that the 
  1233	computer is ready to communicate.
  1234	
  1235	dumb modem - A modem that only sends and receives characters to 
  1236	or from the phone line.  [See also smart modem].
  1237	
  1238	dumb terminal - A keyboard and monitor that receive and send 
  1239	information either to or from another computer or a phone line.  
  1240	It is up to the other computer to do anything else, such as word 
  1241	wrap.  [See also terminal, smart terminal].
  1242	
  1243	duplex - The capability of both sides of a connection to send 
  1244	information at the same time.  Full duplex is the same as duplex.  
  1245	When you are talking on the telephone to someone you are using 
  1246	duplex (you can both talk at the same time if you want to).  [See 
  1247	also half duplex].
  1248	
  1249	
  1250	
  1251	---E---
  1252	
  1253	
  1254	
  1255	EBCDIC - Stands for Extended Binary-Coded Decimal Interchange 
  1256	Code.  It is a way of coding characters.  It is similar to ASCII, 
  1257	but it uses 8 bits instead of 7.  [See also ASCII].
  1258	
  1259	EBBS - Electronic Bulletin Board System.  See BBS.
  1260	
  1261	echo - [1] A reference to an echomail conference.  For example, 
  1262	"This echo has too many messages."  [2] A character that is sent 
  1263	back from a BBS instead of the character that was sent to the 
  1264	BBS.  For example, if you enter your password on a BBS it will 
  1265	often say `dots will echo', meaning that it will send a period 
  1266	for every character in your password (it is a safety feature).  
  1267	[3] When a bulletin board or your terminal program sends back the 
  1268	characters that you type.  If the bulletin board does not send 
  1269	back the characters, your terminal program should print them to 
  1270	your screen as you type them.  [4] Echo on the phone lines is 
  1271	when you hear an echo on a long distance call.  This can inter-
  1272	fere with modem transmissions.  [See also local echo, echo sup-
  1273	pression].
  1274	
  1275	echomail - Many BBS's have message bases that are shared with 
  1276	other BBS's.  Usually late at night the BBS's will exchange any 
  1277	new messages.  This way a user on one BBS can interact with users 
  1278	on other BBS's.  Sometimes echomail can extend across the world.
  1279	
  1280	echo canceling - This is included in the CCITT V.32 standard.  It 
  1281	attempts to cancel echoing on long distance calls, which other-
  1282	wise would interfere with the transmission.  It sends the exact 
  1283	opposite of the sound it receives, which cancels the echo.  [See 
  1284	also echo suppression, digital signal processing].
  1285	
  1286	echo suppression - Echo suppression is a technique that the phone 
  1287	company uses in an attempt to make long distance voice calls 
  1288	sound better, by minimizing echo.  However, this can cause the 
  1289	carrier of a modem to be lost (or at least garbled, causing a 
  1290	loss of data).  In order to prevent this problem, a modem needs 
  1291	to send a certain tone over the phone line at all times.  [See 
  1292	also echo suppression defeat tone].
  1293	
  1294	echo suppression defeat tone - This is a signal sent over the 
  1295	phone lines by some modems in an attempt to cancel out the nega-
  1296	tive effects of echo suppression.  In the Bell standard, it is 
  1297	2225Hz +/- 10Hz, in CCITT standards it is 2100Hz +/- 15Hz.  [Same 
  1298	as dither tone].  [See also echo suppression].
  1299	
  1300	editor - The part of the BBS that allows you to enter a message 
  1301	and edit it.
  1302	
  1303	effective throughput rate - See effective transfer rate.
  1304	
  1305	effective transfer rate - This is the rate at which data can be 
  1306	sent after data compression has been accounted for.  For example, 
  1307	a modem may be rated at 9600bps.  If it uses data compression 
  1308	with a ratio that averages 2:1, it has an effective transfer rate 
  1309	of 19,200bps.  While only 9600 bits are sent over the phone line, 
  1310	they represent 19,200 bits of real information after they are 
  1311	decoded.  [Same as throughput, data throughput, effective 
  1312	throughput rate].  [See also raw speed, data compression].
  1313	
  1314	EIA - Electronics Industry Association.  They developed the RS-
  1315	232C standard.  [See also RS-232C].
  1316	
  1317	electronic mail - See E-mail.
  1318	
  1319	E-mail - Electronic mail.  Messages that are sent to individual 
  1320	people.  You choose who to send the message to and (usually) only 
  1321	that person receives the message.  (Some BBS programs allow you 
  1322	to send bulk E-mail, which goes to more than one person, but the 
  1323	concept is still the same.)  Originally, you could only send mail 
  1324	to people on the same BBS.  Now, through networks, it is possible 
  1325	to send mail to anyone on any BBS in the network.
  1326	
  1327	emoticons - See emotion icons.
  1328	
  1329	emotion icons - These are groups of several characters that are 
  1330	used to express emotion over the phone line.  For example, :) is 
  1331	a happy face (when you look at it from the side).  Similarly, :( 
  1332	is a sad face.  [Same as emoticons].  [See Appendix B].
  1333	
  1334	emulate - When a communications program imitates a certain brand 
  1335	of terminal.
  1336	
  1337	encoder dictionary - See dictionary.
  1338	
  1339	encryption - Coding data so that people who are not supposed to 
  1340	see the data will not be able to understand it.
  1341	
  1342	ENQ character - This is the same as Control-E, ASCII value 5.  It 
  1343	stands for Enquiry.
  1344	
  1345	EOF - Stands for End Of File.  It is the character CTRL-Z, which 
  1346	can mark the end of a text file.
  1347	
  1348	equalization - When a modem adjusts its transmit level for dif-
  1349	ferent frequencies, to account for the greater loss at certain 
  1350	frequencies over the phone line.  [See also transmit level, 
  1351	receive level].
  1352	
  1353	error - When there is line noise and one or more characters are 
  1354	changed.  This is especially noticeable when downloading or 
  1355	uploading a program.  In this case the error must be detected, 
  1356	and the data must be re-sent (or else the file will be 
  1357	destroyed).  [See also line noise].
  1358	
  1359	error control - The ability of a modem to notice errors in trans-
  1360	mission, and have any incorrect data re-sent.  [See also MNP 1-4, 
  1361	LAPM, V.42].
  1362	
  1363	error correction - See error control.  (Error control is a more 
  1364	correct term, since the modem does not correct incorrect data, it 
  1365	just has it sent again).
  1366	
  1367	error free - When referring to data transmission, error free 
  1368	refers to communications equipment in which data is transmitted 
  1369	perfectly.  This is actually an impossible situation, but it is 
  1370	possible to have data that is very, very close to error-free.
  1371	
  1372	ESC - See escape key.
  1373	
  1374	escape character - ASCII character 27.  [See also escape key, 
  1375	ASCII].
  1376	
  1377	escape character guard time - See guard time.
  1378	
  1379	escape code - See escape sequence.
  1380	
  1381	escape key - The key marked ESC on a computer keyboard.  It is 
  1382	often used to 'escape' out of a program or procedure in a pro-
  1383	gram.  Also, the ASCII character (ASCII 27) is used by ANSI to 
  1384	produce limited graphics.  [Same as ESC].  [See also ANSI].
  1385	
  1386	escape sequence - A sequence of characters (usually +++) that 
  1387	instruct a modem to change from data mode to command mode, if 
  1388	they are typed with a certain delay before and after they are 
  1389	typed.  [See also data mode, command mode, guard time].
  1390	
  1391	even parity - This indicates that the parity bit is always set 
  1392	such that the sum of the "1" bits in each byte that is sent, plus 
  1393	the parity bit, is an even number.  [See also parity bit, 
  1394	format].
  1395	
  1396	executive mode - When a user is connected to a bulletin board, 
  1397	but the SysOp is controlling the bulletin board.  The most common 
  1398	use of an executive mode is when the SysOp validates users with-
  1399	out the user having to hang up.
  1400	
  1401	exit - See logoff.
  1402	
  1403	expedited signaling - Break signals that are sent before any 
  1404	other data.  All data will remain intact.  [See also break sig-
  1405	nal].
  1406	
  1407	expert mode - Many BBS's have this feature, which allows a user 
  1408	who feels that he knows the system well to save time by not 
  1409	having menus sent to his system.  If he forgets some commands 
  1410	that are available, he can have the menu appear.  Otherwise, the 
  1411	menus will not appear.  This is especially helpful at slow 
  1412	speeds.
  1413	
  1414	extension - The extension of a filename on an MS-DOS system is 
  1415	the last three characters, which are separated from the rest of 
  1416	the filename by a period.  For example, the filename SPREDSHT.WKS 
  1417	has the extension "WKS".  [See also archive].
  1418	
  1419	external modem - A modem that is located outside of the computer.  
  1420	It is hooked up to the computer with a cable, most commonly an 
  1421	RS-232C cable.  [Same as stand-alone modem].  [See also internal 
  1422	modem].
  1423	
  1424	external program - A computer program that is separate from 
  1425	another program.  When BBS software runs a program that is sepa-
  1426	rate from it, it is called an external program.  [See also door].
  1427	
  1428	external protocol - This is a file transfer program that is not 
  1429	built into your comm program, but the comm program is able to run 
  1430	it anyway (as an external program).  [See also internal proto-
  1431	col].
  1432	
  1433	extract - To take out files from an archive.  [See also archive, 
  1434	unarchive].
  1435	
  1436	
  1437	
  1438	---F---
  1439	
  1440	
  1441	
  1442	factory configuration - The way that your modem was set up when 
  1443	it left the factory.  Typing ATZ normally returns your modem to 
  1444	the factory configuration.
  1445	
  1446	fall-back - The ability of a modem to change to a lower speed 
  1447	when there is a problem communicating at the higher speed (usual-
  1448	ly caused by line noise).  [Same as auto fall-back].
  1449	
  1450	fall-forward - This is when a modem will change to a faster speed 
  1451	if line conditions improve after a fall-back occurs.
  1452	
  1453	fax - Short for facsimile.  It is a copy of a piece of paper that 
  1454	is sent over the phone lines by a fax machine.  Some modems also 
  1455	have fax machines built in them, so that they can send and/or 
  1456	receive faxes.  [See also faxmodem].
  1457	
  1458	faxmodem - A modem that also has the capability of sending and 
  1459	receiving faxes.  [See also fax].
  1460	
  1461	FCC - Federal Communications Commission.  This is the government 
  1462	agency that is responsible for making sure that phone lines are 
  1463	being used correctly and that radio interference is at acceptable 
  1464	levels.
  1465	
  1466	FDM - Frequency Division Multiplexing.  A way that some modems 
  1467	transmit full duplex information, by splitting the telephone 
  1468	bandwidth into two sections.  One is used to receive data, the 
  1469	other is used to send data.  This method can be used at speeds of 
  1470	up to 2400bps.  [See also modulate].
  1471	
  1472	feature negotiation - This is when a modem can determine the best 
  1473	protocol to use when connecting to another modem.  This includes 
  1474	the fastest speed, error control, and data compression.  It is 
  1475	part of hand-shaking.  [Same as negotiation scheme].
  1476	
  1477	feed - The connection between a BBS and a message network.  When 
  1478	a BBS "loses its feed," that means that it is no longer receiving 
  1479	messages from the network, and can not send to the network.
  1480	
  1481	feedback - A message that is sent by a user to the SysOp of a 
  1482	bulletin board.  While it is meant to be a way for the user to 
  1483	let the SysOp know of any complaints or compliments they may 
  1484	have, it is more often a convenient way of sending E-mail to the 
  1485	SysOp.
  1486	
  1487	fidonet - A public network connecting thousands of BBS's around 
  1488	the world.
  1489	
  1490	filter - When a communications program or a BBS program takes out 
  1491	certain characters or words and doesn't accept them.  For exam-
  1492	ple, a bulletin board program may filter out CTRL-G's so that the 
  1493	SysOp does not hear the beeping.  Also, some BBS programs have 
  1494	the ability to take out obscene words from messages.  [See also 
  1495	profanity filter].
  1496	
  1497	filter device - A piece of hardware which goes between the modem 
  1498	and the phone line of a BBS.  When a user calls up, they will 
  1499	either have a voice or computer connection that asks them for a 
  1500	special password before they can gain access to the main computer 
  1501	system.  This makes it more difficult for hackers to get into the 
  1502	system, but is also more of a burden for the legitimate users.
  1503	
  1504	FINGER - On internet, a function that allows you to determine if 
  1505	a user is connected to the network.
  1506	
  1507	flash - On a normal telephone, this is when you quickly push down 
  1508	and release the off-hook button.  It is often used for call 
  1509	waiting.  Many modems have a command that will simulate this 
  1510	action.
  1511	
  1512	flag - A piece of information that is either TRUE or FALSE.  It 
  1513	is used in some bulletin board security systems to indicate 
  1514	whether the user has access to certain parts of the bulletin 
  1515	board.  It is also used by modems for certain indicators such as 
  1516	DTR.
  1517	
  1518	flow control - A method of controlling when information is sent. 
  1519	One method is Xon/Xoff, where a BBS will send information until 
  1520	your computer sends an Xoff (CTRL-S).  It will resume sending 
  1521	information when you send an Xon (CTRL-Q).  [See also Xon/Xoff, 
  1522	CTS/RTS].
  1523	
  1524	format - Information such as "8N1" that describes the way that 
  1525	your computer and a bulletin board should be connected.  The 
  1526	first digit is normally 7 or 8, the number of data bits.  The 
  1527	second character is a letter describing the parity (N for None, M 
  1528	for Mark, S for Space, O for Odd, and E for Even).  The last 
  1529	number is the number of stop bits.  8N1 is the most common for-
  1530	mat.  Data is sent as follows: Start bit (0) - 7 or 8 bits of 
  1531	data - (parity bit, if used) - stop bit (1) - (gap bits, if used) 
  1532	[Same as settings].
  1533	
  1534	forum - See conference.
  1535	
  1536	forward - To send E-mail that you received to someone else.
  1537	
  1538	FOSSIL driver - Fido-Opus-SEAdog Standard Interface Layer.  This 
  1539	is a program that allows BBS and related programs to communicate 
  1540	with different types of modems, keyboard, and monitors.
  1541	
  1542	framing bits - Bits that are used to separate characters.  The 
  1543	bits themselves are not used as information.  [See also stop 
  1544	bits, start bits].
  1545	
  1546	framing error - This occurs when the UART in a modem does not 
  1547	detect a stop bit.  The modems are probably out of sync with each 
  1548	other.
  1549	
  1550	freeware - Computer programs that are copyrighted, but they may 
  1551	be legally copied if there is no payment involved.  They are 
  1552	almost the same as public domain programs, except that public 
  1553	domain programs are not copyrighted and may be sold for payment.  
  1554	Freeware programs often can not be changed when they are distrib-
  1555	uted.  [See also public domain].
  1556	
  1557	freq - Short for "File REQuest."  It is used to get program(s) 
  1558	from a BBS, without logging on.  In order to do this, you need to 
  1559	be part of a network that that the BBS is also part of.
  1560	
  1561	frequency division multiplexing - See FDM
  1562	
  1563	frequency shift keying - See FSK.
  1564	
  1565	frequency spectrum - A range of frequencies having similar char-
  1566	acteristics.  All sounds we hear are grouped as the audio fre-
  1567	quency spectrum.  Similar to bandwidth.
  1568	
  1569	FSK - Frequency Shift Keying.  This method that low-speed modems 
  1570	use to transmit information over phone lines uses 4 frequencies, 
  1571	which are used to represent 0's and 1's for both sending and 
  1572	receiving.  These modems can only operate up to a speed of 600bps 
  1573	at full duplex (or 1200bps at half duplex).  [See also modula-
  1574	tion].
  1575	
  1576	FTP - File Transfer Protocol.  This is the method of transfering 
  1577	files on internet.
  1578	
  1579	full duplex - See duplex.
  1580	
  1581	full flow - See streaming.
  1582	
  1583	
  1584	
  1585	---G---
  1586	
  1587	
  1588	
  1589	gap - See gap bits.
  1590	
  1591	gap bits - A series of 0's that are sometimes sent between data 
  1592	bytes over the phone lines.
  1593	
  1594	garbage - Unwanted characters that appear because of either line
  1595	noise or incorrect settings.  [See also line noise, format].
  1596	
  1597	gateway - A connection between one network and another.  For 
  1598	example, on some commercial on-line services, you can reserve 
  1599	airplane tickets.  This usually involves the on-line service you 
  1600	called connecting to the airline's computer.
  1601	
  1602	general file - Any kind of text on a bulletin board that is not 
  1603	specifically E-mail, a bulletin of any sort, or a message.  
  1604	Usually they are long files for the user's information.  Some 
  1605	examples of general files are: a file containing more information 
  1606	on the bulletin board program, a newspaper article about a con-
  1607	troversial issue, and an article that explains how to make your 
  1608	own disk drive.  
  1609	
  1610	GENIE - One of the major on-line services.
  1611	
  1612	global scan - When a bulletin board goes through all the messages 
  1613	on all boards to check for new messages that the user has not yet 
  1614	read.  This is very useful as it prevents the user from having to 
  1615	go through each board to check for new messages.  [See also 
  1616	quickscan].
  1617	
  1618	goodbye - See logoff.
  1619	
  1620	group III FAX - The standard controlling fax communication.
  1621	
  1622	guard time - When the escape sequence is sent to your modem, the 
  1623	guard time is the amount of time that must occur between charac-
  1624	ters of the escape code, for it to be considered the escape code.  
  1625	Otherwise, it will assume you are entering data that is meant to 
  1626	be sent to the other modem.  [See also escape code, data mode, 
  1627	command mode].
  1628	
  1629	guard tone - A tone that is sometimes sent over the phone line 
  1630	for echo suppression.  1800 hertz and 550 hertz are sometimes 
  1631	used.
  1632	
  1633	guest - When a user is just looking at a bulletin board and does 
  1634	not want to receive an account there.  The user usually has the 
  1635	same privileges as a new user who has not yet been validated.  
  1636	Many bulletin board programs allow guests.  This is a good fea-
  1637	ture, since the SysOp does not have to validate users who will 
  1638	not be calling the board more than once or twice.
  1639	
  1640	
  1641	
  1642	---H---
  1643	
  1644	
  1645	
  1646	hacker - [1] A programmer who likes to experiment with computers 
  1647	(this is the type of person who often will not read the documen-
  1648	tation to software before using it, so he can figure out how to 
  1649	use it by himself).  [2] A person who attempts to abuse the 
  1650	privileges of computer BBS's and other services.  His activities 
  1651	may range from getting and exploring an account he is not sup-
  1652	posed to have on a mainframe computer to attempting to crash a 
  1653	bulletin board.  These people are unwanted by most BBS's.  They 
  1654	are often not malicious.  The media sometimes confuses them with 
  1655	phreakers. [See also phreaker].
  1656	
  1657	half card - For IBM compatible computers, this is a card that is 
  1658	smaller than normal (about half the size).  It does not affect 
  1659	the operation of the modem.
  1660	
  1661	half duplex - This is a mode which allows only one modem at a 
  1662	time to transmit information.  When one modem is finished, the 
  1663	other can then start to transmit.  [Same as simplex].  [See also 
  1664	duplex].
  1665	
  1666	hand-shaking - The process of establishing an electronic link 
  1667	between two modems.  Handshaking lets both modems know informa-
  1668	tion such as the speed they will be using, and whether or not the 
  1669	modems have the same type of error correction capability.  [See 
  1670	also feature negotiation].
  1671	
  1672	handle - See alias.
  1673	
  1674	hang - When a bulletin board all of a sudden starts to do noth-
  1675	ing.  That is, it will not accept calls or even let the SysOp 
  1676	type anything until the computer is reset.  This can be caused by 
  1677	a problem with the BBS software, or the computer itself.
  1678	
  1679	hang up - When someone closes a switch which stops a telephone 
  1680	connection.  This either happens when someone puts a telephone 
  1681	receiver into its cradle or when the person instructs the modem 
  1682	to hang up.
  1683	
  1684	hardware error control - This is when error control is performed 
  1685	by the modem, not the communications program.  [See also error 
  1686	control].
  1687	
  1688	Hayes compatible - Any modem which operates in the same way as 
  1689	the modems developed by Hayes.  Most modems up to 2400bps are 
  1690	Hayes compatible.
  1691	
  1692	Hayes AT command set - This is the set of commands used to oper-
  1693	ate Hayes modems and Hayes compatible modems.  Almost all of the 
  1694	commands start with AT.
  1695	
  1696	help file - Many BBS systems will include information on how to 
  1697	run the system in case you are having troubles.  Often just 
  1698	pressing "H" or a question mark at the main menu will show you 
  1699	the information, but with some systems you have to find the help 
  1700	file somewhere, occasionally amidst the files to be downloaded.
  1701	
  1702	hertz - A unit of frequency, which equals cycles per second.
  1703	
  1704	high speed - A modem that operates at a high speed.  In most 
  1705	cases it is assumed to be at least 9600bps.
  1706	
  1707	host - The computer that is being used to store information from 
  1708	other computers.  Every BBS is a host, and so are pay services.  
  1709	On a network, hosts are all the computers that are connected to 
  1710	the network.
  1711	
  1712	host program - A computer program that allows your computer to 
  1713	accept incoming calls, and let the callers upload or download 
  1714	files.  It is limited compared to a BBS.  If you want to do any-
  1715	thing more, such as record information or print it out, you 
  1716	usually have to do the programming yourself.  [Similar to unat-
  1717	tended mode].
  1718	
  1719	hot-keys - A term which means that you only have to press one key 
  1720	at a menu, rather than several.  You don't have to hit the return 
  1721	key.  Usually you can do this while a menu is being sent to your 
  1722	computer (so you don't have to wait for the whole menu to be 
  1723	sent).
  1724	
  1725	HS/LINK - A file transfer protocol that allows you to upload and 
  1726	download at the same time, which can theoretically double your 
  1727	transferring time.
  1728	
  1729	HST - High Speed Technology.  A high speed protocol developed by 
  1730	US Robotics.  It allows for 14400bps one way, and 450bps the 
  1731	other way.  The two computers can switch when one has more infor-
  1732	mation to send than the other.  It is not compatible with the 
  1733	CCITT protocol.
  1734	
  1735	hyphen - The character -.
  1736	
  1737	Hz. - See hertz.

  1740	
  1741	---I---
  1742	
  1743	
  1744	
  1745	IBM graphics - On IBM computers, there is a group of "graphic" 
  1746	characters (such as lines, used to make boxes) that can be shown 
  1747	on the screen.  Some BBS's will send these graphic characters if 
  1748	requested.  Most non-IBM computers will not recognize these 
  1749	characters.  These characters' bytes have their 8th bit set to 1.
  1750	
  1751	ID number - See user number.
  1752	
  1753	idle time - When a computer is not being used.  This refers to 
  1754	either  a computer running a BBS that is not busy, or a caller 
  1755	that is not sending anything or receiving anything.  Some BBS's 
  1756	will hang up a user if there is a certain amount of idle time 
  1757	(such as a minute).
  1758	
  1759	inactivity timer - When this is on, a modem will automatically 
  1760	disconnect from a remote computer after a given amount of time 
  1761	passes without any information sent or received.
  1762	
  1763	incoming - Information that is being sent to your computer.
  1764	
  1765	information - Any data that is sent between computers.  Data 
  1766	usually refers to numbers and small pieces of information.  
  1767	Information is usually used for larger things, such as text 
  1768	files.  [See also data].
  1769	
  1770	initialize - To set up either hardware or software to work cor-
  1771	rectly with your system.  Many modems have to be initialized each 
  1772	time they are used so they `know' how to act with the communica-
  1773	tions program.  When your software initializes your modem, it may 
  1774	tell the modem to expect 2400 baud and no parity, as well as the 
  1775	fact that you do not want any information to echo on your screen.  
  1776	[See also initialization string].
  1777	
  1778	initialization string - This is the command that your communica-
  1779	tions program sends to the modem when the program is started.  In 
  1780	most cases, it is an AT command just like you would type in.  
  1781	[See also initialization].
  1782	
  1783	interdigit interval - When pulse dialing is used, you need a 
  1784	certain amount of time free of "clicks" so that the phone company 
  1785	knows when each digit is finished.  When you are dialing on a 
  1786	rotary phone, you don't need to worry about this because the time 
  1787	it takes to turn the dial is sufficient.  A modem that sends 
  1788	pulse codes must wait a specified amount of time before going 
  1789	from one digit to the next in a phone number.  A value between 
  1790	1/2 second a 1 second is usually used.
  1791	
  1792	internal modem - A modem that is `hidden' inside your computer.  
  1793	Outside of your computer you will only see the phone cord.  An 
  1794	internal modem can either be on a peripheral card that is placed 
  1795	inside your computer, or it can be built into your computer.  
  1796	[See also external modem].
  1797	
  1798	internal protocol - A file transfer protocol that comes as part 
  1799	of a comm program, and is not separate from it.  [See also exter-
  1800	nal protocol].
  1801	
  1802	International Telephone Union - See ITU.
  1803	
  1804	internet - This is the largest network of BBS's.  It was origi-

  1806	thousands of host computers.
  1807	
  1808	internet address - This is an address used to reach someone on 
  1809	the internet.  It is actually a 32-bit number assigned by the 
  1810	U.S. Government agency DDN Network Information Center.  It is 
  1811	broken down into 4 parts, the domain, the organization, the 
  1812	system, and the department.  [Same as IP address].
  1813	
  1814	internet format - An address on internet.  For example, 
  1815	Joe_User@place.loc.edu.
  1816	
  1817	internet relay chat - On the internet, it is possible for 2 or 
  1818	more users to talk to each other in "semi-real time", meaning 
  1819	that their messages may take a while to reach each other, but 
  1820	quick enough that they can wait for replys and "chat."
  1821	
  1822	interrupt - An interrupt, as far as modems and computers are
  1823	concerned, is an electronic signal that tells the computer that
  1824	something important is happening.  Most modems can be set up by
  1825	software to send an interrupt every time a character is received
  1826	by the modem.  When operating at fast speeds, this makes sure
  1827	that the computer doesn't miss characters as it is printing them
  1828	on the screen or saving them to a disk.
  1829	
  1830	in sequence signaling - Break signals that are sent in the proper 
  1831	order among data, as opposed to expedited signaling (which will 
  1832	send the signal before other data).  No data is harmed, it all 
  1833	remains intact.  [See also break signal].
  1834	
  1835	IP - Internet Protocol.  See internet address.
  1836	
  1837	IP address - Internet Protocol address. See internet address.
  1838	
  1839	IRC - See Internet Relay Chat.
  1840	
  1841	ITU - International Telephone Union, a part of the United Nations 
  1842	involving telephone systems.  Its divisions are responsible for 
  1843	creating standards, and helping underdeveloped countries with 
  1844	their phone systems.  [See also ITU-TSS].
  1845	
  1846	ITU-TSS - Telecommunications Standards Sector of the Internation-
  1847	al Telephone Union.  ITU-TSS can be considered the new name of 
  1848	the CCITT.  It is responsible for creating standards relating to 
  1849	computer telecommunications, namely the V. series of standards.  
  1850	It is expected to be able to bring standards to the industry 
  1851	faster than the CCITT was able to.  [See also ITU, CCITT].

  1864	
  1865	jumper - This is a piece of plastic and metal that can be moved 
  1866	on an internal modem to change a setting, such as the COM port to 
  1867	be used.  [See also selectable COM port].
  1868	
  1869	
  1870	
  1871	---K---
  1872	
  1873	
  1874	
  1875	K - When K is placed after a number, it means 1024 times that 
  1876	number.  If you computer has 640K that means that it has a little 
  1877	more than 640,000 bytes of memory.  Often communications software 
  1878	will tell you that you have a certain amount of free memory to 
  1879	use as a buffer.
  1880	
  1881	Kermit protocol - An almost error-free file transfer protocol 
  1882	usually used for text transfers.  It was developed at Columbia 
  1883	University.  [See also protocol].
  1884	
  1885	keyboard macro - A macro that will allow you to hit one or sever-
  1886	al keys and have the program act as though you had typed a lot 
  1887	directly from the keyboard.  [See also macro].
  1888	
  1889	kill - When referring to a message on a bulletin board, it means 
  1890	deleting that message from the board.  Usually you can only 
  1891	delete the messages that you write (unless you are a SysOp).
  1892	
  1893	
  1894	
  1895	---L---
  1896	
  1897	
  1898	
  1899	LAN - Local Area Network.  This is a group of computers that are 
  1900	all connected.  Usually, there is one computer that controls all 
  1901	peripherals (such as printers and a hard disk drive).  The other 
  1902	computers are linked to the controlling computer, which lets the 
  1903	other computers take turns using the peripherals.  [Same as 
  1904	computer network].
  1905	
  1906	LAPB - Link Access Procedure Balanced.  This is a form of error 
  1907	control found in X.32 packet switched networks.
  1908	
  1909	LAPM - Link Access Procedure for Modems.  A type of error control 
  1910	used by some modems.  It is included in the V.42 protocol 
  1911	(V.42bis also includes it, since V.42bis includes all V.42 error 
  1912	control methods).  It is NOT a compression method, even though 
  1913	some modem manufacturers have incorrectly advertised it as such.  
  1914	[See also V.42, error control].
  1915	
  1916	leased line - A telephone line that directly connects two comput-
  1917	ers.  It is usually rented from the telephone company.  A leased 
  1918	line doesn't have many of the electronic restrictions that a 
  1919	dialup line has, so data can be sent faster.  However, data 
  1920	therefore can only be sent between those two computers.  [Compare 
  1921	to dialup line].  [Same as private line].
  1922	
  1923	LED indicators - The lights on external modems that indicate 
  1924	conditions such as speed, RD, DCD, etc.
  1925

  1927	contribute much to the BBS by uploading programs or using the 
  1928	message bases.
  1929	
  1930	left-brace - The character {.  It's not used often.
  1931	
  1932	left-bracket - The character [.
  1933	
  1934	letter - [1] The characters A-Z (uppercase or lowercase)  [2] 
  1935	Another term for a message posted on a BBS.
  1936	
  1937	LF - Line Feed.  This is a control character (ASCII 10) that is 
  1938	used on some computers and printers to move down one line (on the 
  1939	screen or paper).  It is usually used right after a carriage 
  1940	return.  [See also return].
  1941	
  1942	LHARC - A program that will extract archives with the extension 
  1943	"LZH".  [See also archive, LZH].
  1944	
  1945	line - [1] A row of characters on your screen, for example, many 
  1946	computers have screens with 25 lines.  [See also columns].  [2] 
  1947	The connection between your computer and a BBS.  Most commonly 
  1948	used in the term "line noise."  [3] A phone line connected to a 
  1949	BBS.  For example, a BBS might advertise that it has "4 lines," 
  1950	meaning that 4 people can call the BBS and use it at the same 
  1951	time.  [Same as node].
  1952	
  1953	line delay - See delay time.
  1954	
  1955	linefeed - See LF.
  1956	
  1957	line noise - This is interference on the telephone lines.  It 
  1958	will cause a character or many characters of garbage to appear on 
  1959	your screen.  In general, the higher the bps rate of your modem, 
  1960	the more line noise will appear.  However, error control proto-
  1961	cols strive to eliminate line noise (and get rid of most of it).  
  1962	[See also error control].
  1963	
  1964	link access procedure - See LAPM, LAPB.
  1965	
  1966	local - On a computer that is running a BBS, there are 1 or more 
  1967	phone lines connected to it.  However, the SysOp can usually use 
  1968	the BBS, too, from the keyboard.  This is considered a local 
  1969	connection.
  1970	
  1971	local analog loopback - Tests the connection between a modem and 
  1972	the computer.  [See also local digital loopback].
  1973	
  1974	local area network - See LAN.

  1976	local call - A phone call to a phone number in your local area, 
  1977	which will not incur long distance charges.  [See also long 
  1978	distance call].
  1979	
  1980	local digital loopback - Tests the connections between a comput-
  1981	er, the modem, the phone line, and the remote computer.  [See 
  1982	also local analog loopback].
  1983	
  1984	local echo - This is when a communications program will send 
  1985	information (either that you type or from a file) to your screen, 
  1986	as well as to the other modem.  Usually local echo is not used, 
  1987	and the BBS you are connected to will send the information back 
  1988	to you, and only then will the communications program print what 
  1989	you typed on your screen.
  1990	
  1991	local number - The phone number used after a country code, area 
  1992	code and/or a city code.  In the United States, it is 7 digits 
  1993	long.
  1994	
  1995	log - A log is a file that keeps track of some kind of use.  In a 
  1996	communications program, it might keep track of what BBS's you 
  1997	call.  A BBS can keep a user log, which is a file that indicates 
  1998	which users called up and when.  [See also user log].
  1999	
  2000	logic bomb - This is part of a software program that will do 
  2001	something malicious.  For example, the author of a BBS program 
  2002	might have the program set up so that if he enters his initials 
  2003	in a certain point while the program is running, it will destroy 
  2004	all of the files on the BBS.  These are no longer as common as 
  2005	they used to be.
  2006	
  2007	logoff - To leave a BBS.  When you choose to logoff, the BBS will 
  2008	usually ask if that's what you really want to do, then it will 
  2009	hangup.  It may also ask if you want to leave a note to the 
  2010	SysOp.  [Same as exit, quit, goodbye].
  2011	
  2012	logon - The process of connecting to a BBS.  The is what occurs 
  2013	after you have called the computer and the phone starts to ring, 
  2014	but before you actually start using the BBS.  "Logon" can also 
  2015	include the process of entering your name and password (which is 
  2016	also called sign-on).  [See also signon].
  2017	
  2018	long distance call - A telephone call that is outside your local 
  2019	calling area, and that you must pay for.  [See also local call].
  2020	
  2021	lowercase - The letters that are normally used, such as in this 
  2022	sentence.  The other kind of letters are UPPERCASE.  [See also 
  2023	uppercase].
  2024	
  2025	lurk - This is a term used on some CB simulators, which means 
  2026	that the person is leaving his computer for a while (and there-
  2027	fore will not be able to respond to messages).
  2028	
  2029	LZH - This file extension refers to an archive that was com-
  2030	pressed with the program LHARC.  You need to get the program 
  2031	LHARC from a BBS before you can un-archive the file.  [See also 
  2032	archive, unarchive, LHARC].
  2033

  2037	
  2038	
  2039	
  2040	macro - A series of instructions or text that can be entered by
  2041	hitting a couple of keys.  For example, a communication program
  2042	might let you enter your user name and password just by hitting
  2043	CTRL-N.  [See also trigger character].
  2044	
  2045	mailer - A program used by BBS's that allows for other BBS's to 
  2046	call, so that mail and/or files can be transfered automatically 
  2047	between the two.
  2048	
  2049	mainframe - A large computer that many people can use at the same 
  2050	time.  Usually, a mainframe computer is owned by a large company, 
  2051	and it has a lot of memory and storage for its users.  Some 
  2052	mainframes have phone lines connected to them so that employees 
  2053	(or other authorized people) can use the mainframe from home.
  2054	
  2055	make/break pulse ratio - During pulse dialing, the make/break 
  2056	pulse ratio is the ratio of the time that the phone is off the 
  2057	hook to the time the phone is on the hook.  In America and Cana-
  2058	da, it should be 39/61.  
  2059	
  2060	manual-syncing driver - This is what a BBS uses if the BBS pro-
  2061	gram can not determine directly what the user's bps rate is, and 
  2062	the user must hit the return key several times before the BBS can 
  2063	figure out the user's speed.
  2064	
  2065	mark - When you are looking at the titles of messages to read, 
  2066	some BBS programs will allow you to choose certain ones you want 
  2067	to read.  This is called marking.
  2068	
  2069	mark bit - A bit that is set to 1.  [See also space bit].
  2070	
  2071	mark parity - This is when the parity bit is always set to a 
  2072	binary 1.  [See also parity bit, format].
  2073

  2079	maximum string length - In V.42bis data compression, this refers 
  2080	to the maximum length of data (in characters) represented by one 
  2081	word.  It can range from 6 to 250 characters, although it is 
  2082	usually 32.
  2083	
  2084	menu - A list of options that you can choose from.  A BBS might 
  2085	have a menu that lets you choose from reading messages, download-
  2086	ing, or logging off.  In reality, there would be many more op-
  2087	tions.
  2088	
  2089	message - Any text that is left in a message base on a BBS.  
  2090	These can range from questions for other users to answer, to 
  2091	information on new computer programs, to just about any topic you 
  2092	could imagine.  [See also message base].
  2093	
  2094	message base - A group of messages on a BBS pertaining to a 
  2095	certain topic.  For example, a BBS might have message bases for 
  2096	general messages, computer-related messages, and social informa-
  2097	tion.  Some BBS's have dozens or even hundreds of message bases.  
  2098	[Same as subboard, board].
  2099	
  2100	message network - A network of BBS's that transfer messages 
  2101	between each other.  [See also network].
  2102	
  2103	minicomputer - A scaled-down version of a mainframe.  A minicom-
  2104	puter usually has many terminals connected to it, and can run
  2105	many programs at the same time.  It is more powerful than a
  2106	microcomputer.
  2107	
  2108	MNP - Microcom Networking Protocol.  A type of error control and 
  2109	data compression, created by Microcom, that many newer modems 
  2110	use.  It is built into the modem, unlike software error correc-
  2111	tion in file transfer protocols.  There are different MNP levels.  
  2112	Levels 1-4 are error control protocols, and level 5 is a data 
  2113	compression protocol that can compress data to about 50% of its 
  2114	original size.  A modem with MNP-5 also has MNP-4.  MNP 1-4 is 
  2115	also included in the CCITT V.42 error correction system.
  2116	
  2117	MNP direct mode - This is a mode used on modems with the MNP 
  2118	protocols, where the speeds from the modem to the remote modem 
  2119	and to the computer are the same.  Also, there is no buffering, 
  2120	and no flow control.  [Same as direct mode].  [See also MNP 
  2121	normal mode].
  2122	
  2123	MNP normal mode - This is the more common mode used with modems 
  2124	that have MNP capability, where the speed from the computer to 
  2125	the modem can be higher than the connection between the modem and 
  2126	the remote modem.  This mode uses buffering to prevent lost data.  
  2127	[Same as normal mode].  [See also MNP direct mode].
  2128	
  2129	mode - The state that a computer or a program is in.  For exam-
  2130	ple, a computer can be in a text mode, and a communications 
  2131	program can be in a chat mode (which operates differently than 
  2132	the normal mode).
  2133	
  2134	modem - MODulator/DEModulator.  This is a computer peripheral 
  2135	which allows a computer to communicate over telephone lines.  
  2136	This is the heart of computer telecommunications.  The main 
  2137	factor that differentiates modems is their speed, measured in 
  2138	bps.
  2139	
  2140	modem ready - See DSR.
  2141	
  2142	moderator - The person who is in charge of a conference.  This 
  2143	person usually checks to make sure that all rules are followed

  2147	
  2148	modular cord - A standard telephone cord, with a modular plug at 
  2149	either end.  [Same as modular line.  [See also modular jack, 
  2150	modular plug].
  2151

  2153	(that has a modular plug).  [See also modular cord, modular plug, 
  2154	42A block].
  2155	
  2156	modular line - See modular cord.
  2157	
  2158	modular plug - The square piece of plastic at the end of a tele-
  2159	phone cord.  It plugs into a modular jack.  [See also modular 
  2160	cord, modular jack].
  2161	
  2162	modulate - When a modem changes information from computer bits

  2171	network under the X.400 electronic mail system.  [See also
  2172	X.400].
  2173	
  2174	multiple-speed - This refers to a modem that can operate at 
  2175	several speeds.  Most modems are capable of doing this.  While a 
  2176	modem may be listed as having a speed of 2400bps, it most likely 
  2177	also can operate at 1200bps and 300bps.
  2178	
  2179	multiple-state modulation - A modulation scheme that sends more 
  2180	than one bit per baud.

  2189	
  2190	
  2191	NAK - This control character (CTRL-U) is sometimes used by commu-
  2192	nications or BBS programs (usually in file transfers) to indicate 
  2193	that the information it received was bad.  NAK stands for Nega-
  2194	tive AcKnowledgement.  [See also ACK].
  2195

  2201	netmail - Messages that are sent over networks of BBS's to spe-
  2202	cific people.  It is the same as E-mail, except that E-mail goes 
  2203	to a user on the same BBS that you are calling.  Netmail goes to 
  2204	a user connected to a BBS that is on a network of BBS's that is 
  2205	hooked up to the BBS you call.  [See also E-mail].
  2206	
  2207	network - A group of BBS's that are "linked" together.  This
  2208	means that the BBS's share messages and sometimes files.  Usually
  2209	the BBS's will call each other late at night to get the messages
  2210	and files.  [See also echomail].
  2211	
  2212	network address - In order for a message to find its way to the 
  2213	correct BBS in a network, it must include an address.  Every node 
  2214	in a network should have its own address.  [See also address].
  2215	
  2216	new user - When you use a BBS, usually you will have the status
  2217	of new user for the first few calls, until the SysOp verifies
  2218	your account (at which time you will normally be considered a
  2219	registered user).  A new user usually has less privileges, such
  2220	as not being able to download programs.
  2221	
  2222	news - Some BBS programs will have announcements that are shown 
  2223	when you log on to the BBS.  These are often referred to as news, 
  2224	since they often inform you of changes to the BBS.  [Same as 
  2225	system news].  [See also sign-on message].
  2226	
  2227	next - A command in BBS programs that will let you view the next 
  2228	message in the message base.
  2229	
  2230	node - [1] See line.  [2] A BBS that is connected to a network.

  2238	noise - See line noise.
  2239	
  2240	noise level - See noise power.
  2241	
  2242	noise power - The "loudness" or strength of noise on a phone 
  2243	line.  It is measured in -dBm's.  [See also signal power].
  2244	
  2245	non-destructive backspace - This is when a communications program 
  2246	will not delete any characters on the screen when the backspace 
  2247	key is pressed.  [See also destructive backspace].
  2248	
  2249	non-volatile memory - This is memory that many modems have which 
  2250	is not destroyed when the power is turned off.  Using this memo-
  2251	ry, you can store a certain configuration in the memory, and have 
  2252	the modem automatically use the configuration when you turn it 
  2253	on.
  2254	
  2255	normal mode - See MNP normal mode.
  2256	
  2257	NSF - National Science Foundation.  See NSFNET.
  2258

  2260	government agency.  This network was the basis for the internet.
  2261	
  2262	null character - The ASCII character 0, or CTRL-@.  This charac-
  2263	ter usually will not be printed on the screen.  It was originally 
  2264	used when communications programs were slower and could not 
  2265	receive information as fast as it was sent, so BBS programs would 
  2266	send these characters after every line to slow down the speed at 
  2267	which information had to be received.
  2268	
  2269	null modem - A special connection between two computers that will 
  2270	make the computers think that they are hooked up to a modem, so 
  2271	that the two computers can communicate with each other.
  2272	
  2273	numeric result codes - These are result codes that are printed as 
  2274	numbers, rather than words.  [See also result codes, verbal 
  2275	result codes].

  2277	
  2278	
  2279	---O---
  2280	
  2281	
  2282	
  2283	odd parity - This indicates that the parity bit is always set so 
  2284	that the sum of the bits set to 1 in a byte, plus the parity bit, 
  2285	is an odd number.  [See also parity, format].
  2286	
  2287	off hook - The state that your telephone is in when you pick it 
  2288	up.  In non-computer life, it usually means when the telephone 
  2289	connection is accidentally disconnected, such as "Someone must 
  2290	have left the phone off the hook."  A modem that takes the phone 
  2291	"off hook" is taking control of the phone line, and it will 
  2292	usually then dial a phone number for you.  When a telephone line 
  2293	is "off hook," you are not able to receive calls from other 
  2294	people, unless you have call waiting.  [See also on hook].
  2295	
  2296	off hook button - This is the button on a real telephone that is 
  2297	depressed when you put down the receiver.  It signals the phone 
  2298	company when your phone is off hook, and ready to place calls.
  2299	
  2300	off-line - When your computer is not connected to another BBS.  
  2301	[See also on line].
  2302	
  2303	offline mail reader - A program that allows you to read messages 
  2304	and reply to them after you call a BBS.  This can save you money 
  2305	if you call BBS's long distance (because you do not spend the 
  2306	time reading messages while online with the BBS).  Also, it makes 
  2307	it easier for other callers to reach the BBS, since you spend 
  2308	less time on line.
  2309	
  2310	on hook - When your telephone is not being used, and it is ready 
  2311	to ring if someone calls.  [See also off hook].
  2312	
  2313	on-line - When your computer is connected to a BBS.  For example, 
  2314	some communications programs will keep track of how long you have 
  2315	been on line.  This lets you know how long you have been connect-
  2316	ed to the BBS.
  2317	
  2318	on-line conference - This is when a group of people "get togeth-
  2319	er" and have a conference using their computers.  Some of the 
  2320	major on-line services do this.  [Same as real-time conference].
  2321	
  2322	on-line games - Any game that is played on a BBS.  Sometimes they 
  2323	are played in real time against other players who are using the 
  2324	BBS at the same time, and sometimes they are played by making a 
  2325	move and waiting for their opponent(s) to make their move when 
  2326	they next call.  [See also Role Playing Game].
  2327	
  2328	on-line information service - Any on-line service that provides 
  2329	information.  Most commercial systems fall into this category.  
  2330	[See also on-line service].

  2337	hooked up to the phone line, it usually means a pay service such 
  2338	as Compuserve or GEnie.  [Same as on-line system].  [See also 
  2339	on-line information service].
  2340	
  2341	on-line system - See on-line service.
  2342	
  2343	organization name - This is part of an internet address.  It is 
  2344	usually an abbreviation of the name of the company or organiza-
  2345	tion that controls the computers at that point in the network.  
  2346	[See also internet address].
  2347	
  2348	originate - To call another computer and connect to it.  The 
  2349	originating computer is the one that placed the telephone call 
  2350	(as opposed to the BBS, which is the answering computer).
  2351	
  2352	originate-only modems - Some older modems only operate using an 
  2353	originate frequency, which means that if you try calling one, you 
  2354	must change your modem to send an answer tone.  This can be done 
  2355	on many modems by typing ATDT, the phone number you want to call, 
  2356	and then the letter R (before hitting return).
  2357	
  2358	originating computer - The computer which dials another computer.
  2359	This is most likely referring to your computer (unless you have a
  2360	BBS, or other people are calling your phone number, and you have
  2361	your computer's modem answer the phone).  [See also answering
  2362	computer].
  2363	
  2364	originate frequency - This is the frequency of the carrier that
  2365	is used by the modem that places a call to another modem.  [See
  2366	also answer frequency].
  2367	
  2368	originate mode - This is when a modem is ready to place a call,
  2369	rather than accept an incoming call.  [See also answer mode].

  2383	protocol.
  2384	
  2385	packet radio - The equivalent of a BBS, but with with radio 
  2386	connections instead of telephone connections.  It requires an 
  2387	amateur (ham) radio setup, instead of a modem.  With the right 
  2388	setup, you can read/send messages and even files, using radio 
  2389	waves.
  2390	
  2391	packet switching network - A telecommunications service that 
  2392	transmits data from one computer to another using packets of 
  2393	data.  They usually have telephone numbers in most areas of the 
  2394	country so that users can connect to on-line services without 
  2395	toll charges.
  2396	
  2397	pad - This happens when a file that is being transferred ends in
  2398	the middle of a block of data.  The communications program must
  2399	add blank data to fill up the block.  This is called padding.
  2400	[See also protocol].
  2401	
  2402	PAD - Packet Assembler/Disassembler.  This is a device that 
  2403	disassembles incoming packets, and assembles outgoing packets.

  2405	page - [1] (noun) A page is one screen's worth of information.  
  2406	Many BBS's will automatically wait for you to press a key after 
  2407	it has sent you a page of information. [2] (verb) to alert the 
  2408	SysOp that you would like to speak with him.  Many BBS's will 
  2409	allow you to do this, and it will make beeping sounds so that the 
  2410	SysOp will know you want to talk to him.  [Same as yell].  [See 
  2411	also chat].
  2412	
  2413	PAK - [1] The extension for files archived with the program of
  2414	the same name.  You need the program PAK to un-arc an archive
  2415	with this extension.  [2] The program itself.  [See also archive,
  2416	unarchive].
  2417	
  2418	parallel - This is when a computer sends data one byte (or any
  2419	number of bits other than one) at a time.  This is faster than
  2420	the alternative, serial.  [See also serial].
  2421	
  2422	parallel interface - Any interface that transmits or receives 
  2423	more than one bit at a time.  In most cases, 8 bits are trans-
  2424	ferred at a time.  The RS-232C standard involves a parallel 
  2425	interface.  [See also serial interface].
  2426	
  2427	parity bit - Most modems have the capability to send an extra bit 
  2428	for every byte sent, which is used to help sense errors.  This is 
  2429	called the parity bit.  It can be set to no parity, mark parity, 
  2430	space parity, odd parity or even parity.  Most BBS's do not use a 
  2431	parity bit.  [See also format, mark, space, odd, even].
  2432	
  2433	password - A special code that only you should know.  This code 
  2434	will allow you to gain access to your account on a computer.  
  2435	Different BBS's have different rules as to how long your password 
  2436	can be and what characters can be used.  You should not use a 
  2437	password that is easy to guess (such as your name, or 
  2438	"password"), because a hacker might try to gain access to your 
  2439	account by guessing your password.
  2440	
  2441	pause - On most modems, you can send the modem a command that
  2442	will pause at some point while dialing a number.  This can be
  2443	useful on PBX systems, if you have to wait for a dial tone.
  2444	
  2445	PBX - Private Branch Exchange.  This is the telephone system that 
  2446	many offices have, allowing extensions for each telephone, and a 
  2447	connection to the main telephone system.

  2454	phone number - A number identifying a specific phone line.  In 
  2455	the United States, a phone number consists of a 3 digit area code 
  2456	and a 7 digit number.  If you call BBS's in other countries, 
  2457	there may be a specific country code and city code that is part 
  2458	of the phone number.  You can find many of these codes in a phone 
  2459	book.  A BBS will usually ask you to tell it your phone number 
  2460	before you can be a registered user.
  2461	
  2462	phreaker - A person who spends a lot of time trying to find out 
  2463	as much as possible about the telephone company, and how it 
  2464	works.  They often try to find out ways to make long distance 
  2465	calls for free.  Some steal calls from telephone credit card 
  2466	users, some steal calls from the phone company directly, and 
  2467	others don't make "free" long distance calls.  They are sometimes 
  2468	confused with hackers.  [See also hacker].
  2469	
  2470	pick up - To pick up a carrier is when the 2 modems recognize

  2497	it can get its power from the phone line.
  2498	
  2499	point - A person who has his computer connected to a node on a 
  2500	network.  This person has a special address for his computer.  A 
  2501	person who has a point is considered part of the network.  If you 
  2502	just call a BBS, you are not considered part of the network.  
  2503	[See also node].
  2504	
  2505	poll - [verb] The process when a computer checks to see whether a

  2521	user can do more than a regular user.  For example, they may be 
  2522	able to download more programs than regular users.  [See also 
  2523	user level].
  2524	
  2525	profanity filter - Some BBS's have a special function that will 
  2526	take out specified words (usually swears) from messages that 
  2527	people leave.  That way, the BBS will automatically keep itself 
  2528	"clean," even if users try to leave swears in their messages.
  2529	
  2530	prompt - A character or group of characters that are meant to 
  2531	remind the user of a BBS that he needs to enter some information.  
  2532	It might say "What now?" or it might list the name of the message 
  2533	base the user is currently in, or a list of possible commands.
  2534	
  2535	protocol - [1] When referring to file transfers, a protocol is a 
  2536	method of sending and receiving a program.  There are many meth-
  2537	ods available, each with different advantages and disadvantages.  
  2538	[See also upload, download, Xmodem, Ymodem, Zmodem, Kermit].  [2] 
  2539	Protocol is also used to describe the way that hardware error 
  2540	control is managed.  [See also error control].
  2541	
  2542	PSK - Phase Shift Keying.  In this method of modulation/demodula-
  2543	tion, there are two frequencies used (usually 1200 hertz and 2400 
  2544	hertz).  There are 4 different phase angles (0, 90, 180, and 270 
  2545	degrees), representing dibits 00, 01, 10, and 11.  This is usual-
  2546	ly used for 1200bps transmission.  Note that the baud rate using 
  2547	PSK is really 1/2 of the bps rate, since 2 bits are sent at a 
  2548	time instead of one.  [See also modulation].
  2549	
  2550	PSTN - Public Switched Telephone Network.  This is the regular 
  2551	phone lines that just about everybody uses.

  2603	receive - To transfer information from another computer to your
  2604	computer.  To receive a file is the same as downloading the file.
  2605	[See also send].
  2606	
  2607	receive data LED - On external modems, this LED will light up 
  2608	when the modem is receiving data.  [See also LED indicators].
  2609	
  2610	receive level - The "loudness" of the sound that is received by a 
  2611	modem.  It is measured in -dBm's.  A modem will have a certain 
  2612	range which it can understand, for example, -33dBm to -9dBm.  
  2613	[See also equalization].
  2614	
  2615	receive sensitivity - See carrier detect threshold.
  2616	
  2617	register - A location in memory that stores a value which refers 
  2618	to something specific.  This value can be changed.  For example, 
  2619	most modems have a register that holds a number which tells the 
  2620	modem how many rings it should wait for before picking up the 
  2621	phone.
  2622	
  2623	registered user - This is the most common user level on most 
  2624	BBS's.  It usually allows reasonable usage of the BBS (perhaps it 
  2625	will give you a time limit of 45 minutes per day, and let you 
  2626	download up to 200K of programs per day).  [Same as regular 
  2627	user].  [See also user level].
  2628	
  2629	regular user - See registered user.
  2630	
  2631	reliable link - A connection that is "error-free," meaning that 
  2632	an error control protocol is being used.  [See also auto-reliable 
  2633	link].
  2634	
  2635	remote - A computer in a different location.  For a BBS, the user 
  2636	is at a remote location (since they are connected by the phone 
  2637	line, and not right there).  For a user, the BBS is at a remote 
  2638	location.
  2639	
  2640	request to send - See RTS.
  2641	
  2642	reread - After a message is sent to your computer from a BBS, the 
  2643	reread command will send the message again.  This can be useful 
  2644	if the message is long, and you miss part of it.
  2645	
  2646	reset - A modem can be reset.  This will change any options (such
  2647	as parity and speed) to the values that they have when the modem
  2648	is first used.  This can be useful if you change some values for
  2649	the modem and aren't sure what they do, and then you find that 
  2650	the modem won't work.  Resetting the modem will fix everything 
  2651	for you.
  2652	
  2653	response format - The way that a modem sends certain information 
  2654	to the computer.  It can either be verbal (such as "BUSY" or "NO 
  2655	CARRIER"), or it can be numeric ("7" or "3").
  2656	
  2657	response time - How long it takes for the computer or modem to 
  2658	respond to a certain condition.  For example, a carrier detect 
  2659	response time of 10ms means that it takes the modem 10 millisec-
  2660	onds to figure out that there is a carrier.
  2661	
  2662	result codes - These are either numbers or words that the modem 
  2663	sends to the communications program (which will usually print 
  2664	them on the screen for you to see) that indicate how the modem 
  2665	responded to an action you requested.  For example, if you tell 
  2666	the modem to dial a number, it may respond with "CONNECT 1200", 
  2667	which is a result code that means that the computer dialed the 
  2668	number and connected to a computer on the other end.  [See also 
  2669	numeric result codes, verbal result codes].
  2670	
  2671	retrain - Some modems have the capability of monitoring the phone 
  2672	line to "see" how good the connection is.  If the line quality is 
  2673	poor, these modems can "retrain"--they change their equalization 
  2674	so as to better accommodate the lines.  [See also equalization].
  2675	
  2676	retransmit - To transmit information that was previously sent.  
  2677	Whenever an error is encountered, retransmitting the data will 
  2678	fix the problem.
  2679	
  2680	return - ASCII character 13.  This is the key marked "RETURN" or 
  2681	"ENTER".  It will advance the cursor to the next line.  On some 
  2682	printers, it will just move the print head to the left hand side, 
  2683	and the printer then needs a linefeed to move to the next line.  
  2684	[Same as carriage return, <CR>].
  2685	
  2686	reverse - When you are in a message base, you may find this 
  2687	command which will allow you to read messages is backwards order 
  2688	(from newest to oldest messages).
  2689	
  2690	reverse mode - When a modem switches the signals it should send.  
  2691	For example, in reverse mode, a modem that dials another computer 
  2692	will act as though it just received the call.  Some modems only 
  2693	let you dial out (they do not accept calls).  In order to call 
  2694	one of these modems, you would have to set your modem to reverse 
  2695	mode, and then call the computer.
  2696	
  2697	RI signal - See ring indicator signal.
  2698	
  2699	right brace - The character }.
  2700	
  2701	right bracket - The character ].
  2702	
  2703	ring - When someone calls you on the telephone, the sound that
  2704	your phone makes is called a "ring."  Also, when you call someone
  2705	(or a computer), it will ring before they pick it up.  This
  2706	indicates that the number is not busy, but nobody has picked up
  2707	the phone yet.
  2708	
  2709	ringback - The sound that you hear over the phone that indicates
  2710	that the phone is ringing on the other end, and not busy.  It
  2711	sounds a lot like a phone actually ringing.
  2712	
  2713	ringing indicator LED - This is an LED on some external modems 
  2714	that lights up when the phone is ringing.  [See also LED indica-
  2715	tors].
  2716	
  2717	ring indicator signal - This is the line on an RS-232C cable that 
  2718	indicates that the phone is ringing.
  2719	
  2720	RJ-11 - This is a normal phone jack.  Modems usually have 2 jacks
  2721	like this, one to connect to the phone line, and the other to
  2722	connect to a telephone (that you can use when the modem isn't
  2723	being used).
  2724	
  2725	RPG - See Role Playing Game
  2726	
  2727	Role Playing Game - Some computers don't act as places to leave 
  2728	messages or programs, but instead let you play a game.  On these 
  2729	computers, you have a character and call up the computer to move 
  2730	around in a world with other characters (other people who call 
  2731	up), and you interact with them (for example, you may try to kill 
  2732	the character).  [Same as RPG].  [See also on-line games].
  2733	
  2734	rotary - A phone that dials with the pulse method.  [See also
  2735	pulse dialing, tone dialing].
  2736	
  2737	RS-232 - The name of a specific type of port on the back of some 
  2738	computers, or peripherals such as modems.  It has 9 or 25 pins.  
  2739	[See also RS-232C].
  2740	
  2741	RS-232C - The name of a standard (created by the Electronics 
  2742	Industry Association) for communication between a computer and a 
  2743	serial device.  The interface consists of 25 wires, although a 
  2744	variation contains 9 wires.  Computers and peripherals which both 
  2745	have an RS-232 port can be connected easily with an RS-232C 
  2746	cable.
  2747	
  2748	running - Working.  If a BBS is running, then it is working 
  2749	correctly and people can call it.  [See also down].
  2750	
  2751	RTS - Request To Send.  This is when the computer tells the modem
  2752	that it wants to send information to the other computer.  It is
  2753	only used in half duplex mode.  [See also flow control, CTS].
  2754	
  2755	
  2756	
  2757	---S---
  2758	
  2759

  2765	find new messages or files or look for certain key words within 
  2766	the messages or descriptions.
  2767	
  2768	screen width - The number of characters that a computer can  
  2769	display on one line.  On most modern computers, it is 80 columns.  
  2770	[Same as video width].  [See also columns].
  2771	
  2772	script language - Many communications programs allow the user to 
  2773	write a program, or script, which allows them to use the communi-
  2774	cations program without actually typing anything.  It is often 
  2775	used to call BBS's late at night to download programs or look for 
  2776	new messages.  This way, the user does not have to be there when 
  2777	the communications takes place.
  2778	
  2779	scripting language - See script language.
  2780	
  2781	sector - A unit to measure storage space.  It usually refers to 
  2782	256 bytes.  It is rarely used any more.
  2783	
  2784	security level - Some BBS programs have different user levels, 
  2785	usually numbered, which allow different levels of access.  For 
  2786	example, 0 might refer to an unregistered user, 10 a registered 
  2787	user, and 99 for the SysOp.  Each has different levels of access 
  2788	on the BBS.  [Similar to user level].
  2789	
  2790	selectable COM ports - On internal modems for IBM compatible 
  2791	computers, this allows you to change something on the modem 
  2792	(usually a jumper or DIP switch) to allow you to change which COM 
  2793	port the modem will be connected to.  [See also COM port, jumper, 
  2794	DIP switch].
  2795	
  2796	selftest - The ability of a modem to test itself to make sure it 
  2797	is functioning properly.
  2798	
  2799	send - To transfer information from one computer to another.  To 
  2800	send a file is called uploading the file.  [See also receive].
  2801	
  2802	SendFax(TM) - A modem that can send faxes, but not receive them.
  2803	
  2804	serial - The method used when a computer sends and receives data 
  2805	one bit at a time.  Contrast this to parallel.  [See also paral-
  2806	lel].
  2807	
  2808	serial interface - An interface that transmits only 1 bit at a 
  2809	time.  [See also parallel interface].
  2810	
  2811	serial port - A port on a computer that is used to transmit and
  2812	receive data in a serial fashion (one bit at a time).  [See also
  2813	RS-232C].
  2814	
  2815	service class - The level of MNP protocol that is being used, 
  2816	such as MNP Class 4 or MNP Class 5.  [See also MNP].
  2817	
  2818	settings - See format.
  2819	
  2820	set-up - (noun) - Information that a BBS has about your computer. 
  2821	(verb) - To give the information about your computer to a BBS.  
  2822	This information usually includes screen width, whether or not 
  2823	you want hot-keys, and other miscellaneous information.
  2824	
  2825	shareware - Programs that can be distributed freely, but you must 
  2826	pay for these programs if you use them.  They usually allow you 
  2827	to try them for a specified period of time and then you must 
  2828	either pay for the program or get rid of it.  Many BBS's have 
  2829	shareware programs that you can download without paying the BBS, 
  2830	but you must remember that if you use a shareware program you are 
  2831	supposed to pay for it.  [See also public domain].
  2832	
  2833	shell virus - A virus which places itself either before or after 
  2834	a program on a disk or in memory.  It can be easy to detect such 
  2835	a virus, since the length of the program will be longer after the 
  2836	virus hits than it was before.  [See also virus].
  2837	
  2838	SIG - Special Interest Group.  This is similar to a message base,
  2839	but it may also contain files.  It is generally used on large
  2840	services, such as CompuServe.  [See also SIGop].
  2841	
  2842	SIGop - SIG OPerator.  The coordinator of a SIG.  This person is 
  2843	responsible for checking messages to make sure that they pertain 
  2844	to the topic of the SIG.  [See also SIG].
  2845	
  2846	signal power - The loudness or strength of what a modem sends 
  2847	over the phone line.  It is measured in -dBm's.  [See also noise 
  2848	power].
  2849	
  2850	sign-off message - A message that is displayed when you log off a
  2851	BBS.  Often the message will include the numbers of other BBS's,
  2852	and in some cases the BBS will allow you to leave a message for
  2853	the next user to call the BBS.
  2854	
  2855	sign-on - The procedure of letting a BBS know who you are.  This 
  2856	involves giving the computer information such as you user number, 
  2857	name, password, and sometimes even phone number.  [See also 
  2858	logon].
  2859	
  2860	sign-on message - A message that is displayed by a BBS after you 
  2861	sign on.  Often news about the BBS will go here.  On some BBS's 
  2862	you can leave a sign-on message for the next caller.  [See also 
  2863	news].
  2864	
  2865	simplex - See half duplex.
  2866	
  2867	smart modem - Originally the brand name of a modem, it refers to 
  2868	a modem which has capabilities which make it 'smart'.  Most 
  2869	modems now sold are considered smart.  Basically, it means that 
  2870	the modem has many features.  [See also dumb modem].
  2871	
  2872	smart terminal - A terminal that is capable of certain editing 
  2873	features.  [See also terminal, dumb terminal, terminal 
  2874	emulation].

  2877	
  2878	space parity - This is when the parity bit is always set as a 
  2879	binary 0.  [See also parity bit, format].
  2880	
  2881	special interest group - See SIG.
  2882	
  2883	speed - This refers to the bps rate of a modem.  The most common 
  2884	modem speeds are 300bps, 1200bps, 2400bps, and 9600bps.  [See 
  2885	also effective transfer rate].
  2886	
  2887	stand-alone modem - See external modem.
  2888

  2890	file transfers, that is separate from your comm program, but can 
  2891	be called by it.
  2892	
  2893	start bit - This framing bit indicates that the data byte will be 
  2894	following.  It is always a binary 0.  [See also format, framing 
  2895	bits].
  2896	
  2897	statistics - Any information that a BBS keeps on its users.  Some 
  2898	BBS's keep track of how many messages a user posts, how many 
  2899	programs the user uploads or downloads, and even how many times 
  2900	the user calls.
  2901	
  2902	stats - See statistics.
  2903	
  2904	status line - In communications programs, sometimes the bottom 
  2905	line of the screen will contain a status line, which has informa-
  2906	tion such as the speed of the modem, the parity, how long you 
  2907	have been connected to a BBS and other such information.
  2908	
  2909	status lights - See LED indicators. 
  2910	
  2911	stop bit - When a modem sends a byte of data, it usually sends 
  2912	one or two framing bits after the data byte, before the next byte 
  2913	is sent.  These bit(s) are called stop bits.  They are always a 
  2914	binary 1.  [See also format, framing bits].
  2915	
  2916	streaming - When a file transfer protocol sends data continuous-
  2917	ly, without waiting to make sure there are no errors.  A stream-
  2918	ing protocol should check for errors, but if an error occurs the 
  2919	file transfer should be stopped.  A streaming protocol should 
  2920	only be used with modems that have hardware error control.  [See 
  2921	also Ymodem-g, protocol].  [Same as full flow].
  2922	
  2923	streaming Ymodem - See Ymodem-g.
  2924	
  2925	STU-III - Secure Telephone Unit, generation III.  This is a
  2926	system used by the government that makes voice and data calls
  2927	much more secure.
  2928	
  2929	subboard - See message base.
  2930	
  2931	subject - Most BBS's require that you leave a short description
  2932	about any messages that you post on the BBS.  This description is
  2933	referred to as the subject of the message.  [Same as title].
  2934	
  2935	subop - A term used for the operator of a subboard.  Some BBS's 
  2936	allow a person besides the SysOp to control a specific message 
  2937	base.  This person would be able to kill any messages that he/she 
  2938	felt were inappropriate.
  2939	
  2940	synchronous communication - With synchronous communication, data 
  2941	bytes are not marked with a beginning and end, but instead are 
  2942	sent at a specific interval.  When computers send data to modems, 
  2943	it is synchronous communication.  When modems send the informa-
  2944	tion they get from the computer, the modem usually will add start 
  2945	and stop bits to identify the bytes.  That is asynchronous commu-
  2946	nication.  [See also asynchronous communication].
  2947	
  2948	SysOp - Short for SYStems OPerator.  This is the person who is in
  2949	charge of a BBS.  He has the power to change anyone's user level,
  2950	delete users, delete or edit messages.  Usually this is the same
  2951	person who paid for the BBS equipment and pays for the phone
  2952	line.  [See also Co-SysOp].
  2953	
  2954	SysOp window - Some BBS programs have an area of the computer 
  2955	screen (on the computer that the BBS runs on, not the user's 
  2956	screen) that gives information about the user who is on-line, 
  2957	such as his password, where he is from and his phone number.  
  2958	This is called the SysOp window, and is for the convenience of 
  2959	the SysOp.  [Similar to top of screen display].
  2960	
  2961	system - [1] Your computer.  When a BBS asks for your system 
  2962	configuration, it is referring to information about your comput-
  2963	er, such as screen width.  [2] A BBS.
  2964	
  2965	system files - Any computer files that are used by an operating
  2966	system, or in the case of BBS's, files that are used by the BBS
  2967	program that do not get changed.

  2980	tab - The key on your keyboard that will move the cursor forward
  2981	about 5 spaces.  It is not an ASCII character (it is similar to a
  2982	function key, since it does not output a single character).
  2983	
  2984	tag - To choose what you want from a list.  A BBS might let you 
  2985	tag certain files to download all at once.  Also, you can tag 
  2986	certain message areas.  This way, the BBS will assume those are 
  2987	the only message areas you are interested in, and it will not 
  2988	send you messages from other areas.
  2989	
  2990	tagline - When using an offline mail reader, you often have the 
  2991	option of including a "tagline" at the end of your messages.  
  2992	This is often a funny saying or a quote, and usually takes up 
  2993	just 1 line.
  2994	
  2995	talk mode - See voice mode.
  2996	
  2997	TCM - Trellis Coded Modulation.  This is a form of error control

  3012	
  3013	telecommunication(s) - This word has no precise definition, but 
  3014	is frequently used.  Its definition ranges from "any form of 
  3015	communication over a distance" to "any communication by electric 
  3016	means" to "two computers 'talking' to each other via modems."  
  3017	Methods of communications that probably are considered telecommu-
  3018	nications: BBS's, telephones, TV's and fax machines.  The word is 
  3019	used both in singular and plural.
  3020	
  3021	telecommuting - The idea of company employees working from home, 
  3022	rather than their office.  At home, they can communicate with the 
  3023	office (and other entities) by modem or voice calls.
  3024	
  3025	telecomputing - Using computers to communicate.  This usually 
  3026	involves using modems to communicate over the phone lines, but 
  3027	can also involve other media such as the air waves.
  3028	
  3029	Telenet - The packet-switched network that is used for PC-Pur-
  3030	suit, which is operated by U.S. Sprint.

  3040	terminal mode - Some modems have a built in terminal program.  On 
  3041	these modems, if that program is running, the modem is said to be 
  3042	in its terminal mode.  It also refers to the state where a modem 
  3043	is ready to accept commands, although command mode is the pre-
  3044	ferred term.
  3045	
  3046	terminal program - A program that allows a person to use a modem.  
  3047	It is generally very limited.  A communications program is a more 
  3048	advanced version of a terminal program.  Usually a terminal 
  3049	program will simulate a specific brand of terminal.  It generally 
  3050	does not support file transfers.  [Also called term program].
  3051	
  3052	terminate - To disconnect with another computer.  This is some-
  3053	times listed as a command in menus on BBS's.
  3054	
  3055	text file - Any information that can be read, and is stored in a 
  3056	computer file.  A text file can be any kind of information, such 
  3057	as a description of a computer program.
  3058	
  3059	thread - A group of related messages on a BBS, within the same 
  3060	message base.  If a user posts a reply to a message, some BBS's 
  3061	will start a thread.  If a message is part of a thread, the BBS 
  3062	will have a command so that you can see the original message, 
  3063	which started the thread.
  3064	
  3065	throughput - See effective transfer rate.
  3066	
  3067	tilde - The character ~.
  3068	
  3069	time limit - Most BBS's have a time limit, where you can only be 
  3070	on the BBS for a certain amount of time.  On some BBS's you can 
  3071	only be on for a certain amount of time each time you call, on 
  3072	others there is a limit of time that you can be on the BBS per 
  3073	day.
  3074	
  3075	time out - BBS programs often will disconnect a user if he
  3076	doesn't type anything for a certain amount of time.  Time out
  3077	occurs when the time limit is reached and the BBS program hangs
  3078	up on the user.  This is done so that users do not tie up the
  3079	BBS.  If a user is connected to the BBS but is not using it, 
  3080	other callers might not be able to use the BBS.
  3081	
  3082	timing signal - A signal sometimes sent by modems over the phone 
  3083	line that lets the receiving modem know when a byte of informa-
  3084	tion starts.  It is required in synchronous communication.
  3085	
  3086	title - See subject.
  3087	
  3088	tone dialing - This is a method that a phone or modem can use to 
  3089	dial a phone number.  It uses one audible tone per digit to be 
  3090	dialed.  [See also pulse dialing].
  3091	
  3092	top of screen display - Some BBS's have this display on the top 
  3093	of the screen of the computer running the BBS.  This will show 
  3094	the SysOp certain information about the user who is on-line, such 
  3095	as his phone number, how many programs he has downloaded, etc.  
  3096	[Similar to SysOp window].
  3097	
  3098	topology - How a network is organized.  In other words, which 
  3099	computers (or BBS's) are connected to each other.  
  3100	
  3101	touchtone dialing speed - The length of time that your modem 
  3102	sends each touchtone digit over the phone lines.  It is the 
  3103	equivalent to the length of time that you hold down the buttons 
  3104	on a phone when you make a call.
  3105	
  3106	training sequence - A way of detecting the quality of the phone 
  3107	lines.  Two compatible modems can do this by sending out the 
  3108	"training sequence," which tests the phone line at various fre-
  3109	quencies.  When one of the modems receives this information, it 
  3110	compares it to what it should be (if the phone lines were per-
  3111	fect).  The modem then can adjust various frequencies (using 
  3112	equalization) to accomodate the problems in the phone line.
  3113	
  3114	transfer - To send a computer program from one computer to anoth-
  3115	er.  [See also download, upload, protocol].
  3116	
  3117	transfer protocol - See protocol.
  3118	
  3119	transmission control protocol - See TCP.
  3120	
  3121	transmission rate - See data transmission rate.
  3122	
  3123	transmission speed - See data transmission rate.
  3124	
  3125	transmit data LED - This is an LED on an external modem that will 
  3126	light when the modem is transmitting data over the phone line.  
  3127	[See also LED indicators].
  3128	
  3129	transmit level - The "loudness" level of the sound leaving a 
  3130	modem to go over the phone lines.  It is measured in -dBm's.  It 
  3131	should be different at different frequencies, since certain 
  3132	frequencies have more loss over the phone line than others.  [See 
  3133	also equalization].
  3134	
  3135	trapdoor - This usually refers to a BBS program (or a mainframe 
  3136	that you call up) that has a special code that can be entered to 
  3137	give you high access.  Usually, it is entered as a user name and 
  3138	password when logging on.  These are undocumented by the program, 
  3139	and usually were created by the programmers so that they could 
  3140	gain access to any computer running their BBS program.  Hackers 
  3141	try to find trapdoors, but they are usually not created by hack-
  3142	ers.  (Some other kinds of software have trapdoors, such as video 
  3143	games, which might have trapdoors to give you extra lives).
  3144	
  3145	Trellis-coded modulation - See TCM.
  3146	
  3147	trigger character - This is a character that, when pressed, 
  3148	starts a macro.  [See also macro].
  3149	
  3150	trojan horse - A trojan horse is a program within another pro-
  3151	gram, usually on a mainframe or a computer running a BBS.  The 
  3152	original program looks innocent, but when run it will trigger the 
  3153	trojan horse, which will usually try to gain access to the main-
  3154	frame computer system or BBS.
  3155	
  3156	TTY - A TeleTYpe machine.  It is a keyboard and a printer com-
  3157	bined in one unit.  It is hooked up to another computer.
  3158	
  3159	TTY mode - This is when a communications program emulates a TTY 
  3160	machine, which only involves printing characters and recognizing 
  3161	the linefeed, carriage return and backspace characters.  [See 
  3162	also TTY].
  3163	
  3164	two-wire leased line - See leased line.
  3165	
  3166	Tymnet - A packet-switched network.
  3167	
  3168	type-ahead buffer - Some BBS programs let you type characters to 
  3169	the BBS, even while it is sending information to you.  When it is 
  3170	finished sending the information to you, it will then act on the 
  3171	information you sent.  The type-ahead buffer refers to the proc-
  3172	ess, and the space in the BBS computer's memory where the charac-
  3173	ters are held.
  3174	
  3175	
  3176	
  3177	---U---
  3178	
  3179	
  3180	
  3181	UA - User Agent.  It is the program that people use to create and
  3182	read messages under the X.400 system.  [See also X.400].
  3183	
  3184	UART - Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter.  This is a 
  3185	device in a computer or modem that will change serial data (the 
  3186	way data comes in over the phone line) to parallel, and vice 
  3187	versa.  [See also serial, parallel, 16550 UART, 8250 UART, 16450 
  3188	UART].
  3189	
  3190	un-arc - See unarchive.
  3191	
  3192	unarchive - To take out the files from an archive.  [Same as 
  3193	unarc].  [See also archive, extract, ARJ, ZIP, ARC, PAK, LZH].
  3194	
  3195	unattended mode - This mode is available on some communications 
  3196	programs.   It will let your computer wait for a telephone call 
  3197	from another computer, and will let the person using that comput-
  3198	er access your computer (usually to download or upload programs).  
  3199	It is called unattended because you don't have to wait for the 
  3200	person to call, the program will automatically answer when some-
  3201	one calls.  [See also attended mode].  [Similar to host program].
  3202	
  3203	underline character - The character _.
  3204	
  3205	underscore character - Any character (although almost always the
  3206	underline character) that is used for underlining.  When this
  3207	method is used, the text to be underlined will be sent (usually
  3208	to a printer), and then backspaces will be sent, and then the
  3209	underscore character will be printed over the text, so it looks
  3210	like it is underlined.
  3211	
  3212	upload - To send a program from your computer to a BBS.  [See 
  3213	also download, protocol].
  3214	
  3215	uppercase - Letters that are used for emphasis, as opposed to 
  3216	regular lowercase letters.  CAPITAL letters are the same as 
  3217	uppercase letters.  The first word in a sentence is in uppercase.  
  3218	Some older computers were only capable of displaying uppercase 
  3219	characters.
  3220	
  3221	user - A person who uses a BBS.  For example, a BBS might claim 
  3222	that it has 500 users, which means that there are 500 different 
  3223	people who have called the BBS.
  3224	
  3225	user level - The level of security which a user has.  This usual-
  3226	ly is in the form of word(s), usually progressing from: New User, 
  3227	Registered User, Privileged User, SysOp Level.  [See also securi-
  3228	ty level].
  3229	
  3230	user list - Most BBS programs will allow you to see a list of all 
  3231	its users.  It will show the user's name, and often city and 
  3232	state.  This is called the user list.  Rarely will it show any 
  3233	phone numbers or more detailed information.
  3234	
  3235	user log - A file on a computer running a BBS that lists which 
  3236	users called, what time they called, and sometimes information as 
  3237	to what they did while they were on the BBS.
  3238	
  3239	user name - This is the name that a person uses on a computer 
  3240	system.  Sometimes an alias is used, but it is more often the 
  3241	user's real name or a variation of it.  [See also alias].
  3242	
  3243	user number - A number that is used by some older BBS programs to 
  3244	keep track of users.  On these BBS's, a user would have to remem-
  3245	ber a specific number as well as his password.  Most BBS's now 
  3246	just use the person's user name instead, which is much easier for 
  3247	a user to remember.  [Same as account number, ID number].
  3248	
  3249	userfile - A file that a BBS program has that keeps track of all 
  3250	users of the BBS and their statistics.
  3251	
  3252	
  3253	
  3254	---V---
  3255	
  3256	
  3257	
  3258	V.17 - The CCITT standard for fax transmission at 14,400bps.
  3259	
  3260	V.21 - The international standard, created by CCITT, that con-
  3261	trols transmission at 300bps.  [See also 103].
  3262	
  3263	V.22 - The international standard for transmission at 1200bps, 
  3264	created by CCITT.  [See also 212A].
  3265	
  3266	V.22bis - The international standard, created by CCITT, that 
  3267	controls data transmission at 2400bps.
  3268	
  3269	V.23 - The CCITT protocol for transmission of 1200bps one way, 
  3270	75bps the other way.
  3271	
  3272	V.24 - This, combined with V.28 is the CCITT standard equivalent 
  3273	to EIA's RS-232C standard.  V.24/V.28 has 25 pins, just like the 
  3274	original RS-232C standard.  [See also RS-232C].
  3275	
  3276	V.28 - Part of V.24.  [See also V.24].
  3277	
  3278	V.29 - The CCITT standard for 9600bps half-duplex communications.
  3279	
  3280	V.32 - The international standard controlling transmission at 
  3281	9600bps.  It was created by CCITT.  It has provisions for fall-
  3282	back, if the line is too noisy.
  3283	
  3284	V.32bis - The international standard for 14,400 bps modems, 
  3285	created by CCITT.
  3286	
  3287	V.42 - A standard error control system created by CCITT that is 
  3288	in use on many 9600bps modems and some 2400bps modems.  It in-
  3289	cludes LAPM, as well as MNP 2-4.  [See also error control, V.42 
  3290	compatible, V.42 compliant].
  3291	
  3292	V.42 compatible - This is a modem that follows all the V.42 
  3293	specifications, except for LAPM error control (instead it uses 
  3294	MNP).  [See also V.42].
  3295	
  3296	V.42 compliant - This is a modem which follows all the V.42 
  3297	specifications, and uses LAPM error control if possible.  Other-
  3298	wise, it will go to MNP error control.  [See also V.42].
  3299	
  3300	V.42bis - A CCITT standard for data compression.  It can compress
  3301	data with about a 3:1 compression ratio, although it can compress
  3302	up to 4:1 given the right conditions.  Any modem with V.42bis
  3303	also has V.42 error control.  [See also data compression].
  3304	
  3305	V.Fast - At this time, the proposed CCITT standard for communica-
  3306	tions at up to 28,800bps.  It will most likely be the new stand-
  3307	ard for high-speed data communications.  It probably will use 
  3308	adaptive line probing and symbol rates to determine the fastest 
  3309	acceptable speed, given the condition of the phone line.  Most 
  3310	people will not be able to achieve 28.8Kbps rates originally, 
  3311	until phone line conditions improve.
  3312	
  3313	verbal result codes - These are result codes which are printed as 
  3314	words, rather than numbers.  [See also result codes, numeric 
  3315	result codes].
  3316	
  3317	verify - This is when a SysOp makes sure that a new user is who 
  3318	he or she claims to be.  The normal procedure is for the SysOp to 
  3319	call up a new user, just to make sure that the phone number he 
  3320	listed is real.  This is a way to make sure that the users are 
  3321	less likely to abuse the system.  However, most SysOps do not 
  3322	call new users, since it is time consuming.  Some SysOps will 
  3323	look at the information the new user left just to make sure it 
  3324	"looks" right (if the new user says his phone number is 555-1212, 
  3325	the SysOp knows it is not real).  After verifying the user, the 
  3326	SysOp will usually raise the user's user level.
  3327	
  3328	verified user - Any user who has been verified by the SysOp.  It 
  3329	is also used to refer to users who have access better than that 
  3330	of new users.
  3331	
  3332	video width - See screen width.
  3333	
  3334	videotex - The idea of getting information by computer, over the
  3335	phone lines, and paying for it.  It is the computer version of
  3336	audiotex (900 numbers, voice mail, having computers call you).
  3337	
  3338	virus - Any program which spreads itself secretly.  It reproduces 
  3339	within a computer, and also will go to other computers if possi-
  3340	ble (through file transfers).  At a certain point in time, the 
  3341	virus will do something (anything from saying "Boo" to something 
  3342	destructive, such as erasing all files on a hard disk drive).  
  3343	They are often hidden inside legitimate programs that seem to run 
  3344	normally, but contain the virus.  It will usually spread to every 
  3345	program you run.  Viruses became widespread because BBS's can 
  3346	inadvertently spread virus all across the country.  Whenever you 
  3347	download a program, it might have a virus in it.  However, there 
  3348	are several programs available which find many viruses and can 
  3349	destroy them.
  3350	
  3351	voice detection - The ability of a modem to detect whether a
  3352	computer answers the phone, or whether it is a human voice.
  3353	
  3354	voice grade - A telephone line that is designed to transfer human 
  3355	voice.  This is the way most phone lines are set up.  However, 
  3356	the phone company also has data grade lines, which are supposed 
  3357	to make data communications better.  [See also data grade].
  3358	
  3359	voice mail - An addition to some modems.  This allows the modem 
  3360	to also answer incoming voice calls, send recorded (voice) mes-
  3361	sages to the caller, and let them leave a message.  [Same as 
  3362	answering machine].
  3363	
  3364	voice mode - Some older modems require the user to manually dial 
  3365	phone numbers through a telephone.  When this is done, the modem 
  3366	is in voice mode.  When the remote computer picks up the phone, 
  3367	the user must switch his modem from voice mode to data mode.  
  3368	[Same as talk mode].  [See also data mode].
  3369	
  3370	vote - Some BBS's have this feature, which allows the SysOp to 
  3371	find out user's preferences about things ranging from operation 
  3372	of the BBS to political positions.  It is similar to a survey in 
  3373	the non-computer world.  [Same as poll].
  3374	
  3375	VT100 - A smart terminal, which is emulated by many communica-
  3376	tions programs.  It uses ANSI codes.  [See also ANSI].
  3377	
  3378	VT52 - Another smart terminal, which is emulated by some communi-
  3379	cations programs.
  3380	
  3381	
  3382	
  3383	---W---
  3384	
  3385	
  3386	
  3387	WHOIS - A way of finding out biographical information about a 
  3388	user on internet, if the user has provided such information.
  3389	
  3390	window - A distinct area of a computer screen that contains 
  3391	information different than the rest of the screen.  Sometimes it 
  3392	covers other information 'underneath' the window (in which case 
  3393	it is temporary), or it is permanent and does not contain other 
  3394	information.  [See also SysOp window].
  3395	
  3396	word wrap - A function of editors on BBS's (just like that found
  3397	in most word processors) which will move a word that won't fit at
  3398	the very right hand of the screen down to the next line.
  3399	
  3400	worm - A program which embeds itself within another program.  
  3401	Either it tries to find a space in which it won't be noticed, or 
  3402	it will just stick itself anywhere within the main program (which 
  3403	will ruin that program).  A worm is almost always destructive.  
  3404	[See also virus].
  3405	
  3406	
  3407	
  3408	---X---
  3409	
  3410	
  3411	
  3412	X.25 - This is a packet-switching protocol developed by CCITT.
  3413	It is used to carry large amounts of data at fast speeds over
  3414	leased phone lines.  [See also X.32].
  3415	
  3416	X.25 dialup - See X.32.
  3417	
  3418	X.32 - This is CCITT's 1984 update of X.25, also known as X.25 
  3419	dialup.  [See also X.25].
  3420	
  3421	X.400 - This is the CCITT standard protocol for a global system
  3422	for the exchange of electronic mail.
  3423	
  3424	X.500 - The CCITT standard for a directory of the users of the
  3425	X.400 system.  [See also X.400].
  3426	
  3427	xfer - Short for transfer.  It usually refers to file transfers.  
  3428	[See also upload, download].
  3429	
  3430	Xmodem - A file transfer protocol developed by Ward Christensen 
  3431	around 1977.  It is fairly slow by today's standards, but was the 
  3432	first widespread file transfer protocol.  It uses blocks of 128 
  3433	bytes, and after each block is sent, it sends a 1 byte checksum 
  3434	to check for errors.  If an error is encountered, the block will 
  3435	be re-sent.  Almost every communications program offers this 
  3436	protocol.  [Same as Christensen protocol].  [See also protocol].
  3437	
  3438	Xmodem/CRC - The same as Xmodem, but it has a 16-bit CRC instead 
  3439	of the checksum, which makes it more reliable (it catches more 
  3440	errors).  [See also protocol].
  3441	
  3442	Xmodem-1K - This is similar to Xmodem/CRC, except it uses blocks 
  3443	of 1024 bytes, rather than 128.  It is faster than Xmodem, since 
  3444	it needs to stop less often to check for errors.  This is some-
  3445	times incorrectly called Ymodem.  [See also protocol, Xmodem, 
  3446	Ymodem].
  3447	
  3448	Xoff - The CTRL-S character.  This is often used to pause infor-
  3449	mation that is being sent.  The information will be continued 
  3450	when an CTRL-Q is received.  [See also flow control, Xon].
  3451	
  3452	Xon - The CTRL-Q character.  This will sometimes continue paused 
  3453	information.  [See also flow control, Xoff].
  3454	
  3455	Xon/Xoff - The flow control method using the Xon and Xoff charac-
  3456	ters.  It is built into the software, not the hardware.  [See 
  3457	also Xon, Xoff, flow control].
  3458

  3461	---Y---
  3462	
  3463	
  3464	
  3465	yell - See page (verb).

  3467	Ymodem - A file transfer protocol which can transfer more than 
  3468	one file at a time.  It transfers both a file and some informa-
  3469	tion about the file (including its length, and the name of the 
  3470	file).  It is similar to Xmodem/CRC, except that Ymodem can 
  3471	transfer more than one file at a time.  It will use CRC-16 if 
  3472	possible, or else it will use a 1 byte checksum.  It will use 
  3473	both 1024 byte blocks and 128 byte blocks.  [See also protocol].
  3474	
  3475	Ymodem-g - This is Ymodem changed to provide best results with 
  3476	error-correcting modems.  Errors can be discovered by the proto-
  3477	col, since Ymodem-g uses CRC, but if there are any errors in the 
  3478	transmission, the transmission will be aborted.  [See also Ymo-
  3479	dem, protocol, streaming].  [Same as streaming Ymodem].

  3487	ZIP - The file extension which refers to archives that were
  3488	created by the program PKZIP.  You need the program PKUNZIP to
  3489	get the files out of the archive.  [See also archive, unarchive,
  3490	PKZIP, PKUNZIP].
  3491	
  3492	Zmodem - A file transfer protocol which is known for its speed, 
  3493	as well as the ability to transfer information about the files 
  3494	which it sends.  It has crash recovery and auto-download fea-
  3495	tures, and can use a 32 bit CRC, which makes it almost error-
  3496	free.  [See also protocol].

  3757	                             HISTORY
  3758	
  3759	Telecommunications Dictionary version 0.99:
  3760	
  3761	     This was the first version available.  It was incomplete, 
  3762	with about 150 words, only covering A-K.  But it was nice for 
  3763	people not to have to wait another year to see part of it.  It 
  3764	was released in 1989.  It was usually in a file called 
  3765	"MODEMDIC".
  3766	
  3767	
  3768	Telecommunications Dictionary version 1.00:
  3769	
  3770	     This was the first real version.  It had somewhere around
  3771	430 words defined in it.  It was released on August 15, 1991.  It
  3772	was sent out originally as "TDIC100" in a ZIP compressed format.
  3773	
  3774	
  3775	Telecommunications Dictionary version 1.10:
  3776	
  3777	     This version had more than 530 words listed. Many words were 
  3778	added, some extra information was added to some old words, and 
  3779	several minor errors were corrected.  It was released on August 
  3780	22, 1991 (I was very busy that week!).  It should be called 
  3781	TDIC110.TXT, or if archived, TDIC110.ZIP (or whatever extension).
  3782	
  3783	
  3784	Telecommunications Dictionary version 1.20:
  3785	
  3786	     This version was not officially released.  It was an interim 
  3787	version.  It updated about half the definitions existing in 
  3788	version 1.10, and minor inconsistencies were fixed.  Also, a few 
  3789	words were added.
  3790	
  3791	Telecommunications Dictionary version 1.21:
  3792	
  3793	     Another interim version, not officially released.  Last 
  3794	modification in August, 1992.
  3795	
  3796	The Modem Dictionary version 1.25:
  3797	
  3798	     An interim version, just before 1.30.  The name was changed, 
  3799	since the dictionary is specific to modems, just a small portion 
  3800	of telecommunications.
  3801	
  3802	The Modem Dictionary, version 1.30:
  3803	
  3804	     This version was widely distributed, and contains all of the 
  3805	improvements found in the previous, unreleased versions.  It was 
  3806	marketed as shareware on a trial basis.  This version is on file 
  3807	at the United States Copyright Office, in Washington.  Released
  3808	in November 1992.
  3809	
  3810	The Modem Dictionary, version 1.50:
  3811	
  3812	     The current version.  The main change is that is was changed 
  3813	back to freeware.  It will remain that way.  Released 1/93.
  3814	
  3815	The Modem Dictionary, version 2.00:
  3816	
  3817	     This version.  It has been improved quite a bit, mostly due 
  3818	to the appendixes and the new definitions relating to the Inter-
  3819	net and offline readers.  Released 9/93.
