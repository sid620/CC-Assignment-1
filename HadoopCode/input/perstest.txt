     2	Mind reader: do personality tests pick out bad apples?

     6	For years, employers have given job applicants paper-and-pencil tests
     7	to assess basic skills such as reading and arithmetic.  These days,
     8	candidates may be confronted with a different type of exam as well: a
     9	personality test that asks about their attitudes toward a variety of
    10	stituations.  Answers are often run through a computer to produce a
    11	profile that rates the applicant on scales, or "personality
    12	constructs," as they are called in the jargon of the trade, with names
    13	like "gregarious" and "tough-minded."
    14	
    15	But widespread screening worries some psychologists and personality
    16	researchers.  The tests, marketed in the U.S. by such companies as the
    17	Institute for Personality and Ability Testing in Champaign, Ill.,
    18	Consulting Psychologists Press in Palo Alto, calif., and the
    19	Psychological Corporation in San Antonio, Tex., are being used by
    20	employers to exclude those not suited for sensitive jobs, in police
    21	departments and nuclear power plants, for example.  They are also a
    22	means of selecting candidates with desirable traits, such as
    23	extroversion, for marketing positions.
    24	
    25	Rodney L. Lowman, a psychologist at Duke University Medical center and
    26	author of a book about testing, offers some words of caution:  "There
    27	is far more practice than there is research literature to support the
    28	proactive use of these tests."  Lowman believes that "mistakes are
    29	being made by screening services that may be overly aggressive at
    30	weeding people out."  And the desirable characteristics used for
    31	screening applicants "often read like a Boy Scout list of virtues, and
    32	the specific job relevancy has yet to be demonstrated."  Lowman points
    33	out that one commonly used test--the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality
    34	Inventory, published by the University of Minnesota Press-was designed
    35	for clinical patients rather than job applicants.
    36	
    37	In addition, few commercial personality tests have been validated in
    38	published studies.  The confirming studies that have appeared, charge
    39	Steve Blinkhorn and Charles Johnson, industrial psychologists at
    40	Psychometric Research and Development Ltd. in England, are so full of
    41	statistical errors that it is doubtful whether most of the constructs
    42	predict anything.  The two fired a broadside at preemployment
    43	personality testing in the December 20-27, 1990, issue of Nature,
    44	where they accused psychologists of adopting "an approach to
    45	correlation that would have left its inventor Karl Pearson gasping."
    46	
    47	Usually, the British critics suggests, developers of tests have
    48	identified apparently significant associations by sifting through
    49	thousands of combinations of response patterns and job performance
    50	measures.  But such trawls throw up spurious correlatios by blind
    51	chance, a complication that test marketers tend to overlook.  Nor have
    52	the test services often checked their claimed correlations against new
    53	data.  Blinkhorn and Johnson found that for three well-known
    54	commercial tests, most of the supposed correlations between] scoores
    55	and job performance were likely to be the result of pure chance.
    56	
    57	Other critics are concerned about tests that purport to measure
    58	honesty or integrity, which have become increasingly popular since
    59	polygraph testing by businesses was banned in 1988.  More than five
    60	million people in the U.S. take honesty tests each year, accordnig to
    61	one estimate.  These tests attempt to flag job candidates who are
    62	likely to steal property or company time by asking about their past
    63	behavior and their attitudes to variouis types of theft.
    64	
    65	Despite the obvious possibilities for cheating, some sellers claim the
    66	tests can predict subsequent inventory disappearances or detect
    67	previous criminal behavior.  But validating such tests is difficult
    68	because employee-thieves are seldom caught.  In addition, publishers
    69	of honesty tests "intentionally err on the side of lenience" to avoid
    70	making false accusations, contends Richard E. Clingenpeel, who runs
    71	Personnel Selection International, a job agency in Milford, Mich.
    72	
    73	According to a draft report on honesty tests by the American
    74	Psychological Acsociation, "a few firms have made public a number of
    75	reports of studies having to do with the reliability and validity of
    76	their instruments, but most firms have produced nothing of this sort."
    77	The congressional Office of Technology Assessment concluded recently
    78	that published validations of integrity tests are flawed and
    79	inadequate.
    80	
    81	Still, basic personality tests have their proponents, who argue that
    82	they can be a useful screening tool.  "I agree there's plenty of very
    83	bad research using personality tests, but I wouldn't characterize the
    84	whole field that way," says Paul R. Sackett, a psychologist at the
    85	University of Minnesota.
    86	
    87	Since the mid-1980s a consensus has emerged that there are five or six
    88	robust personality dimensions out of the many more that have been
    89	proposed.  Michael K. Mount, an organizational psychologist at the
    90	University of Iowa, groups personality constructs into one or other of
    91	what he calls the Big Five categories (extroversion, emotional
    92	stability, agreeableness, conscientousness and openness to
    93	experience).
    94	
    95	Mount and some other psychologists say they are finding modest
    96	correlations between such personality traits and job performance. 
    97	Using the emerging technique of meta-analysis, which rigorously
    98	compares data collected in different studies, Mount and his colleague
    99	Murray R. Barrick surveyed 117 studies of personality traits and job
   100	performance for a paper that will be published shortly in Personnel
   101	Psychology.  "In a nutshell, personality indicators were not good
   102	predictors," Mount says.  One measure, conscientiousness, did show a
   103	persistent correlation with job performance.  But the correlation is
   104	about half as strong as that achieved by mental ability tests.
   105	
   106	The U.S. Army has for some years been conducting an exercise, known
   107	cryptically as Project A, to develop personality tests.  Long-term
   108	validation studies with large numbers of subjects are under way. 
   109	Leaetta M. Hought of the Personnel Decisions Research Institute in
   110	Minneapolis, the principal contractor for Project A, has also used
   111	meta-analysis to show that some aggregated personality constructs may
   112	predict something about job performance.  One of these, called
   113	dependability, is similar to Mount's conscientiousness construct.
   114	
   115	Ivan Robertson, a psychologist at the University of Manchester in
   116	England, agrees that meta-analysis shows that "there's a definite
   117	effect of personality--but it's small."  Properly constructed
   118	personality tests seem to give unique information that could be useful
   119	to employers if used with other forms of screening, Robertson says.
   120	
   121	So will meta-analysis bring validated personality tests that are the
   122	answer to a corporate recruiter's prayer?  Blinkhorn doubts it because
   123	of the difficulty in training testers.  Moreover, he points out that
   124	if Hough's results are typical, a test would have to be used very
   125	stringently to hire noticeably better workers.  If only the
   126	best-scoring 10 percent of candidates were hired, the proportion of
   127	above-average workers in a group would rise from 50 percent to only 59
   128	percent, and many good workers would be wrongly rejected.
   129	
   130	The suspicion that personality tests unjustly reject some applicants
   131	is probably why they are unpopular, admits Scott Martin, a
   132	psychologist at London House, a test publisher in Park Ridge, Ill. 
   133	"Once you make it objective, it gives people something to criticize." 
   134	But Martin argues that even a poor test will erroneously turn away
   135	fewer good candidates than selecting at random.
   136	
   137	Martin's argument may be irrelevant in the real world.  Although some
   138	pre-employment test publishers say their tests should accompany other
   139	forms of assessment, such as an interview, in practice personality and
   140	honesty tests are often used instead of other forms of assessment.  So
   141	they could be a step backward.  Lou Maltby of the American Civil
   142	Liberties Union fears that tests may create an unemployable group who
   143	"test dishonest" or otherwise prove unsuitable.  If Maltby is right,
   144	pseudopsychology will hurt employers as well as employees.
