     3	                              Young and Young-at-heart
     4	
     5	                YouthNet is an international network that gears itself to
     6	          the interests of the "young and young at heart".  We have echos
     7	          designed to allow young people to talk with other young people
     8	          around the world. The echos covers a wide range of topics from
     9	          entertainment to fantasy to science. Everything from learning how
    10	          to have fun all the way to having fun while learning. Which ever
    11	          your preference may be, there is a place for you in YouthNet.
    12	
    13	                But young people around the world are not the only ones
    14	          interested in young people. Many adults are either "young at
    15	          heart" or have serious interest in how the next generation of
    16	          adults are doing. What are they interested in, how are they
    17	          dealing with in today's society, what do they think of where our
    18	          planet is heading? There are many places for these people to talk
    19	          with others like them and even the young people themselves!
    20	
    21	                Besides our own forums, we have gateway arrangements with
    22	          both DiscNet and WorldNet. Several echos are passed between these
    23	          networks, giving you greater reach with a single message.
    24	          Messages can be sent person to person within YouthNet and even to
    25	          individuals in these other networks. Many other ideas are
    26	          currently being considered and discussed in the both the sysop
    27	          and coordinators echos. You input to the growth of YouthNet will
    28	          be most welcomed.

    30	                We are a young network ourselves, with coverage in many
    31	          places around the country and in Canada. However there are still
    32	          many cities where we are in need of interested people to serve as
    33	          Coordinators to help our network grow. So even if there isn't a
    34	          YouthNet system in your city, there is no reason why you still
    35	          can join.
    36	
    37	                I hope to hear from you soon. Please feel free to contact me
    38	          if you have any questions I may be able to help you with. Later!
