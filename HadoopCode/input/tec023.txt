     4	Subject: Upgrading to DRDOS 6.0 with STACKER installed.
     5	
     6	Tech023 - 2/20/92
     7	______________________________________________________________________
     8	
     9	STACKER has been found to be compatible with DR DOS 6.0. This note
    10	outlines the procedure for upgrading your system to DR DOS 6.0 when
    11	Stacker is installed.
    12	
    13	This procedure is NOT required if the following conditions are true:
    14	
    15	    1. STACKER has not yet been installed.  Install DRDOS 6.0, then
    16	       STACKER.
    17	    2. The boot drive is NOT being SSWAPped, AND there is enough room
    18	       on the uncompressed drive C: (3 MB) for the DR DOS 6.0 files. 
    19	       In this case, simply boot up with the DRDOS 6.0 STARTUP
    20	       diskette and run INSTALL.
    21	
    22	Installation Procedure:
    23	
    24	   Note: this procedure assumes that:
    25	       1. Drive C: is the boot drive.
    26	       2. It may or may not be SSWAPped with a Stacker drive
    27	       3. There is enough disk space (3MB) on the Stacker drive to install
    28	          DR DOS 6.0.
    29	
    30	In the following sequence of steps, you will need to know which drive
    31	letter refers to your boot drive and which drive letter refers to your
    32	Stacker drive. This information may be obtained by running the SWAPMAP
    33	utility which came with Stacker. One of the lines will look like the
    34	following:
    35	
    36	    Drive x: was drive C: at boot time
    37	
    38	Letter 'x:' will be the boot drive. If 'x:' is 'C:', then 'Drive C: is
    39	NOT swapping' and, in the procedures which follow:
    40	     drive C: will be the boot drive, and
    41	     your Stacker drive letter should be inserted for drive 'x:'.
    42	
    43	If 'x:' is not 'C:' then 'Drive C: IS swapping' and:
    44	     drive C: is the Stacker drive,
    45	     drive x: is the boot drive.
    46	
    47	1. Remove the read-only attribute from files already on the system.
    48	Please insert your Stacker diskette into drive A: (or drive B:).
    49	Change to the diskette drive by typing A:       (or B:) and hitting
    50	Enter. Then type the following commands (ignore any 'File not found'
    51	messages):
    52	
    53	    SATTRIB  -R  C:\CONFIG.SYS
    54	    SATTRIB  -R  C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT
    55	    SATTRIB  -R  C:\COMMAND.COM
    56	
    57	(In the next command, substitute the name of your DOS directory if it
    58	is named something other than 'DOS'.)
    59	
    60	    SATTRIB  -R  C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM
    61	
    62	In the following four commands, if drive C: is swapping, remember to
    63	use the boot drive letter you found above to replace the drive letter
    64	'x:'. If drive C: is not swapping, use the drive letter of your Stacker
    65	drive in place of 'x:'.
    66	
    67	    SATTRIB  -R  x:\CONFIG.SYSc
    68	    SATTRIB  -R  x:\AUTOEXEC.BAT
    69	    SATTRIB  -R  x:\COMMAND.COM
    70	
    71	(As before, in the next command, substitute the name of your DOS
    72	directory if it is named something other than 'DOS'.)
    73	
    74	    SATTRIB  -R  x:\DOS\COMMAND.COM
    75	
    76	2. Copy the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files to the Stacker drive.
    77	   If drive C: is swapping, type the following:
    78	
    79	    REN C:\CONFIG.SYS CONFIG.STA
    80	    (ignore a 'Duplicate filename or file not found' message)
    81	    REN C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT AUTOEXEC.STA
    82	    COPY x:\CONFIG.SYS C:\
    83	    ('x:' is the boot drive swapping with C:)
    84	    COPY x:\AUTOEXEC.BAT C:\
    85	    ('x:' is the boot drive swapping with C:)
    86	
    87	If drive C: is not swapping, type the following:
    88	
    89	    REN x:\CONFIG.SYS CONFIG.STA
    90	    ('x:' is the Stacker drive) (ignore a 'Duplicate filename or file
    91	not found' message)
    92	    REN x:\AUTOEXEC.BAT AUTOEXEC.STA
    93	    ('x:' is the Stacker drive) (Ignore a 'Duplicate filename or file
    94	not found' message)
    95	    COPY C:\CONFIG.SYS x:\
    96	    COPY C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT x:\
    97	
    98	3. Insert the DR DOS 6.0 STARTUP Disk (Disk 1) in the A: drive. Then
    99	   type the following commands:
   100	
   101	    COPY A:\COMMAND.COM C:\
   102	    COPY A:\COMMAND.COM x:\
   103	
   104	(In the next commands, substitute the name of your DOS directory if it
   105	is named something other than 'DOS'.)
   106	
   107	    COPY A:\COMMAND.COM C:\DOS
   108	    COPY A:\COMMAND.COM x:\DOS
   109	
   110	4. Boot the system with the DR DOS 6.0 STARTUP Disk in the A: drive.
   111	
   112	5. At the opening screen of the DR DOS 6.0 installation, hit the F10
   113	   key to abort. Then choose "EXIT TO DR DOS" and hit Enter.
   114	
   115	6. At the A> prompt, type the following:    SYS C:
   116	  The system will respond with:
   117	  Destination Disk was not formatted under current Operating System.
   118	  Writing new boot sector.  System files copied.
   119	
   120	7. Remove the DR DOS 6.0 STARTUP disk from the A: drive and reboot the
   121	   system from the hard disk.
   122	   This will start the system with DR DOS 6.0 and the Stacker drive(s)
   123	   will be available. If any application is automatically loaded during
   124	   bootup, please exit the application and return to the DOS prompt.
   125	
   126	8. At the C> prompt, place the DR DOS 6.0 STARTUP disk back into the A:
   127	   drive.
   128	
   129	9. Change to the DR DOS diskette. Type the following:
   130	
   131	    A:AUTOEXEC
   132	
   133	10. The installation process for DR DOS 6.0 will begin.
   134	    At the opening screen, press the Enter key to continue. Choose to
   135	    install DR DOS on the C: drive and press Enter. Next, select the option
   136	    to "Use the information in the existing file(s)".
   137	
   138	11. You will now be asked to specify the drive letter and directory
   139	    name to receive the DR DOS 6.0 files. Move the cursor to the suggested
   140	    pathname for DR DOS 6.0. If drive C: is swapping, choose drive C:; if
   141	    drive C: is not swapping, choose drive x: (remember to substitute the
   142	    actual drive letter for 'x:', determined above). Also, change the
   143	    'DRDOS' subdirectory name to the name of your DOS directory. This is
   144	    because we want to overwrite the existing DOS version with DR DOS 6.0.
   145	    Otherwise, there will be two DOS versions on the system at the same
   146	    time - not a good situation.
   147	
   148	12. Choose to "Replace all DOS files on the destination drive."
   149	
   150	13. At this point you may choose either to skip the configuration and
   151	    go directly to installation, or you may choose to proceed with further
   152	    configuration.
   153	
   154	14. Follow the instructions displayed on your screen to complete the
   155	    installation of DR DOS 6.0.
   156	When DR DOS 6.0 is finished, you will be given a choice to "Exit to DR
   157	DOS" or "Reboot Computer". Choose "Exit to DR DOS".
   158	
   159	15. If drive C: is not swapping, type the following:
   160	
   161	           COPY x:\CONFIG.SYS C:\
   162	           COPY x:\AUTOEXEC.BAT C:\
   163	
   164	       If drive C: is swapping, type the following:
   165	
   166	           COPY C:\CONFIG.SYS x:\
   167	           COPY C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT x:\
   168	
   169	16. Remove the last DR DOS 6.0 diskette and reboot the system from the
   170	hard disk.
   171	
   172	17. DR DOS 6.0 adds new commands to your existing CONFIG.SYS file.
   173	When the machine is rebooted, DR DOS will ask if you want to execute
   174	any commands from your previous CONFIG.SYS. This will particularly
   175	affect the Stacker lines. Hit 'Y' to each of the questions about
   176	loading the Stacker drivers. When the system has completed booting, use
   177	your favorite text editor (or the DR DOS EDITOR program) to remove the
   178	'?' from in front of the Stacker lines. You will also need to examine
   179	any other lines which have been so marked. These changes need to be
   180	made to the CONFIG.SYS file on the uncompressed drive. After making
   181	these changes, copy the CONFIG.SYS file to the Stacker drive.
   182	
   183	Also during bootup, you may see a "Bad or missing file..." message as
   184	DR DOS attempts to find a DOS program or driver not copied to the
   185	uncompressed drive during the installation process. Simply copy the
   186	missing program file(s) from your DOS directory on the Stacker   drive
   187	to the directory on the uncompressed drive where DR DOS is looking.
   188	
   189	 For example, if you were previously loading the DOS file 'ANSI.SYS'
   190	from the 'DOS' directory on the uncompressed drive, type the following
   191	to update 'ANSI.SYS' to the DR DOS 6.0 version (as before, substitute
   192	the name of your DOS directory if it is named something other than
   193	'DOS'):
   194	
   195	           COPY C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS x:\DOS   (drive C: is SSWAPping)
   196	       or
   197	           COPY x:\DOS\ANSI.SYS C:\DOS   (drive C: is not SSWAPping)
   198	
   199	There may be other programs from the previous version of DOS on the
   200	uncompressed drive which will need to be replaced with the equivalent DR DOS programs. You will need to search
   201	both the root directory and the DOS directory for these programs.
   202	
   203	18. Finally, some files from your previous DOS version may still be
   204	located in your DOS directory.
   205	These files have no corresponding replacement in DR DOS 6.0. Please
   206	examine them and consult your User's Guide to see if they can be
   207	deleted. Be careful not to delete anything which may be required for
   208	normal operation of your system. Type the following to display a list
   209	of these files (substitute the name of your DOS directory if it is
   210	named something other than 'DOS'):
   211	
   212	          DIR C:\DOS /A | FIND /V "8-23-91" | MORE  (drive C:
   213	SSWAPping)
   214	       or
   215	          DIR x:\DOS /A | FIND /V "8-23-91" | MORE  (drive C: not
   216	SSWAPping)
   217	
   218	If you would like to send this listing to the printer, simply add the
   219	characters  > PRN  to the end of the above lines.
   220	
   221	    WARNING !! - DO NOT delete the files TASKMAX.INI, VIEWMAX.INI, or
   222	DRDOS.INI. These files are critical to the correct operation of DR DOS
   223	6.0. They will be included in the above listing because these files are
   224	customized during installation and, therefore, the dates of these files
   225	will be the date of your installation of DR DOS 6.0.
   226
