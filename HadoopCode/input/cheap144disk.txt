     2	                    Cheap 1.44mb Disk!
     3	
     4	 For those of you out there that like me are tired of paying
     5	OUTRAGEOUS prices for 1.44meg floppies here are two ways to get
     6	around the problem. But first a little insight as to what the
     7	actual difference is between the two disk types.
     8	 The reason a 720K disk will not format out to 1.4mb is that
     9	there is a second window on the high density disk. This window is
    10	picked up by a switch in the drive to determine the type of disk.
    11	If the window is not present the drive sends a fault to the
    12	controller and you get a message of invalid media. The people
    13	making the disks would like you to believe that the high density
    14	disk are totally different then the 720K disks. In reality they
    15	are all made in the same factories under the same conditions and
    16	with the same materials. The only difference is that the HD disks
    17	are guaranteed to format out to 1.44mb while the DSDD disk are
    18	not. I really don't think that this guarantee is worth 4 to 5
    19	times the price in disks!
    20	 The first and most obvious way to get around the problem is to
    21	simply put a hole in the disk case at the proper location. This
    22	works well and with care is very acceptable. I prefer to use a
    23	5/32" drill bit in a chuck that can be used by hand. This
    24	eliminates the possibility of getting dust on the inside of the
    25	case as you will get only one long chip if your bit is sharp. The
    26	hole must be place exactly opposite of the one for the write
    27	protect window. For the average person this is the best way. For
    28	those of you that are more confident in your abilities read on!
    29	 The second and by far the better way to solve this problem is to
    30	modify the drive so as to bypass the media detect switch all
    31	together. This requires the removal of the drive from the
    32	computer. Hold the drive upside down with the disk slot facing
    33	out. You will see the switch for the write protection on the left
    34	side just in back of the disk slot. Directly opposite this switch
    35	on the right side you will find a switch with two solder
    36	connections on it. This is the media detect switch. Simply
    37	install a jumper across the two pads and you can now use cheap
    38	disk for high density storage! NOTE..IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBTS ABOUT
    39	HAVING THE RIGHT SWITCH USE A HOLE IN THE DISK INSTEAD OF THIS
    40	MOD AS A MISTAKE COULD CAUSE IRREPARABLE DAMAGE TO YOUR DRIVE! A
    41	hole in the disk is less of a headache than having to buy a new
    42	drive! 
    43	 For those skeptics or purists who doubt that this truly works
    44	you should know that out of over 400 disks formatted in this
    45	matter I have a failure rate of less then .5%. I do however use a
    46	good quality of disk (BULK 3 1/2" DSDD from the MICRO CENTER). I
    47	for one do not like holes in the disk and have the other mod.
    48	However whichever one you choose, just think of all the money you
    49	can save by just a little time! 
    50	 REMEMBER TO MARK YOUR DISKS IF YOU DON'T HAVE A HOLE IN THEM OR
    51	YOU WILL END UP WITH FAILURES TRYING TO WRITE TO A WRONG FORMAT!
