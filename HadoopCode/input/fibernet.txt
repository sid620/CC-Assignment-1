     1	Simon Wong, Vice President, FiberNet Research Inc., announced the
     2	introduction by FiberNet Research Inc. of three series of Fiber
     3	Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) network interface cards, and a high
     4	performance FDDI-Ethernet bridge.
     5	
     6	The products represent advances in the state of the art for their
     7	respective product categories. They bring the 100 Mbit/second data rate of
     8	FDDI more affordable to the desktop. They are fully compliant with the
     9	ANSI X3T9.5 FDDI standard, and feature an industry-first single board
    10	implementation.
    11	
    12	The network interface cards will be available with driver code for Netware,
    13	UNIX, and LAN Manager, and feature LLC, SNMP, and SMT as appropriate.
    14	
    15	The FR1100 series network interface card for the ISA/IBM PC AT bus,
    16	incorporates an Intel i80960CA 25 MHz RISC processor, 1 MB RAM (with 4 MB
    17	option), second generation Motorola or AMD FDDI chipset. It features a 45
    18	MBps memory bandwidth and about 30 MIPS raw processor power. The cards
    19	list from as low as $4,195 for the single attachment shielded twisted pair
    20	version to $7,995 for the dual attachment fiber based version.
    21	
    22	The FR1200 series network interface card for the EISA bus uses the Motorola
    23	MC68EC040 25MHz processor, 1 MB RAM (with 4 MB option), second generation
    24	Motorola FDDI chipset. It features a 45 MBps memory bandwidth and about
    25	25MIPS raw processor power. The cards list from as low as $4,695 for the
    26	single attachment shielded twisted pair version to $9,495 for the dual
    27	attachment fiber based version.
    28	
    29	The FR1600 series network interface card for the Sun SPARC SBus boasts the
    30	Intel i80960CA 25 MHz RISC processor, 1 MB RAM (with 4 MB option), and
    31	second generation Motorola FDDI chipset. It features 45 MBps memory
    32	bandwidth, and about 30 MIPS raw processor power. The cards list from as
    33	low as $5,195 for the single attachment shielded twisted pair version to
    34	$9,995 for the dual attachment fiber based version.
    35	
    36	The FR2110 fiber based and FR2120 STP based high performance FDDI-Ethernet
    37	bridge has an industry-leading 500,000 packet/second filtering rate and a
    38	14,700 packet/second forwarding rate. It has 1 FDDI port and 1 Ethernet
    39	AUI port and comes in a compact desktop enclosure. It features the Intel
    40	i80960CA 25 MHz RISC processor, 1 MB RAM (with 4 MB option), second
    41	generation Motorola FDDI chipset, and Intel 82596CA 32bit Ethernet
    42	coprocessor. List prices are $11,995 and $9,995 respectively.
    43	
    44	Fibernet's management and engineering team have had five years' experience
    45	with FDDI product design and manufacturing. They have formed strategic
    46	alliances with industry leaders in key areas of the networking industry.
    47	
    48	FiberNet will be exhibiting at the Networld Boston show in February and at
    49	the Interop Washington DC show in May 1992
    50	
    51	The products will be available for sale in the second quarter of 1992.
