     1	SUNNYVALE, Calif.--January 27,1992--Telebit Corporation (NASDAQ: trading
     2	symbol TBIT), a pioneer of high-speed modems, dial-up networking, and
     3	wide-area communications products, introduced today the ModemMizer,
     4	Telebit's newest member of the ACS (asynchronous communication server)
     5	product family that functions as a non-dedicated communications server
     6	solution for Novell Netware and NetBIOS networks.
     7	
     8	ModemMizer is a modem-sharing software solution that operates on any
     9	existing PC workstation and supports up to two modems with port speeds up
    10	to 38,400bps. Providing both dial-in and dial-out functionality, the
    11	ModemMizer utilizes dynamic allocation of ports to effectively manage LAN
    12	modem resources. This insures that no modems or telephone lines are
    13	inaccessible unless they are actually being used. Since the ModemMizer
    14	operates in the background of any PC, local and remote users can access
    15	other applications such as electronic mail and file transfer as well as
    16	dial-out service providers without interrupting the host PCs activity on
    17	the network.
    18	
    19	ModemMizer also offers comprehensive network management features including
    20	activity reporting, built-in breakout box, data trace, and remote console
    21	capabilities that are typically offered only in dedicated communications
    22	servers. All of these features can be accessed from any local or remote PC
    23	on the network.
    24	
    25	"ModemMizer is the ideal modem-sharing solution for small PC LANs that want
    26	to maximize the performance of high-speed modems and reduce hardware and
    27	phone line costs at the same time," said Michael Ballard, President and
    28	CEO.
    29	
    30	The Telebit ModemMizer software package is available immediately for a list
    31	price of $349 and includes a standard 90 day warranty.
    32	
    33	Included with ModemMizer is a two concurrent user license for pcANYWARE
    34	IV/LAN version 4.5 software and two copies of pcANYWARE IV/Remote
    35	providing terminal emulation, remote control and support for remote
    36	Windows. Additionally, ModemMizer operates with other third-party
    37	communications packages that support either the Telebit APL Interrupt 14
    38	or NASI workstation interfaces.
    39	
    40	Telebit Corporation designs, manufactures and markets advanced highspeed
    41	products for dial-up networking and wide-area communications. The
    42	company's digital signal processing technologies provide extremely
    43	reliable error-free communications across the global switched telephone
    44	network. Telebit markets its products worldwide through distributors,
    45	original equipment manufacturers and value-added resellers.
