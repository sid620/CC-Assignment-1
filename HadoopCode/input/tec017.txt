    17	  TITLE:          Using MAXIMIZE memory optimizer with SSWAP
    18	      
    19	
    20	  OVERVIEW:
    21	        Maximize doesn't "know" about situations in which drive letters are
    22	        abruptly switched during boot.  This situation occurs when the Stac
    23	        program SSWAP is used during the execution of config.sys.
    24	
    25	  ISSUES/COMMENTS:
    26	        This procedure requires a bootable diskette.  Refer to the FORMAT
    27	        command in your DOS manual for instructions on creating one.
    28	
    29	        386MAX and BLUEMAX are equivalent programs for 386 based clones and
    30	        386 based PS/2 machines respectively.  In this technote, the term
    31	        386MAX is used to refer to both programs.
    32	
    33	  RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
    34	        This procedure is to be used with the Qualitas Corp. program MAXIMIZE
    35	        to modify your config.sys and autoexec.bat files to load all possible
    36	        programs and drivers into high memory.  It is designed to be used
    37	        from a bootable diskette.
    38	
    39	        This procedure is NOT necessary if:
    40	                1. A Stacker volume is not installed on drive C:, or
    41	                2. The Stacker volume installed on C: is not being SSWAPed.
    42	        For either of these situations, simply MAXIMIZE according to the
    43	        Qualitas instructions.
    44	
    45	        You will need to know which drive letter refers to your boot drive.
    46	        This can be determined by running the Stacker utility SWAPMAP.  One
    47	        of the lines will look like...
    48	
    49	                Drive x: was drive C: at boot time
    50	
    51	        Whatever letter is "x:" will be the boot drive.  In the procedure
    52	        below, the boot drive is referred to as "x:".
    53	
    54	        IF YOU ARE INSTALLING 386MAX FOR THE FIRST TIME...
    55	        After booting normally, exit any shell program you may be using and
    56	        unswap your boot drive by entering: SSWAP C: x:  Then install MAX.
    57	        DO NOT exercise the option to MAXIMIZE at this time.
    58	
    59	        STEP 1.
    60	        If you've just installed 386MAX...
    61	        Assuming you used the default installation options and the 386MAX
    62	        files are all in x:\386MAX, enter the commands below and reboot the
    63	        computer.
    64	        MKDIR C:\386MAX
    65	        COPY x:\386MAX\*.* C:\386MAX
    66	        
    67	        STEP 2.
    68	        Insert the bootable diskette into drive A: and enter the commands...
    69	        COPY x:\CONFIG.SYS A:\
    70	        COPY x:\AUTOEXEC.BAT A:\
    71	        COPY x:\386MAX\MAXIMIZE.EXE A:\
    72	        COPY x:\386MAX\MAXIMIZE.TRM A:\
    73	        
    74	        STEP 3.
    75	        Edit the autoexec.bat file on A: and insert the line...
    76	        PATH=C:\
    77	        as the first line.  Save the modified autoexec.bat file.
    78	
    79	        STEP 4.
    80	        Boot the computer from this diskette and run MAXIMIZE.  MAXIMIZE will
    81	        ask you to press Enter to reboot.  Do so.  
    82	        
    83	        STEP 5.
    84	        During this phase MAXIMIZE will give you the option of excluding 
    85	        programs in config.sys from consideration for being loaded high.
    86	        Exclude any occurrances of SSWAP.COM from consideration.  After a 
    87	        similar choice is made for autoexec.bat, the computer will reboot 
    88	        for the final phase.
    89	
    90	        STEP 6.
    91	        Enter the following commands...
    92	        COPY A:\CONFIG.SYS x:\
    93	        COPY A:\AUTOEXEC.BAT x:\
    94	        then reboot the computer.
    95	
    96	        STEP 7.
    97	        If you wish to return to your former configuration enter... 
    98	        COPY A:\CONFIG.MAX x:\CONFIG.SYS
    99	        COPY A:\AUTOEXEC.MAX x:\AUTOEXEC.BAT
   100	        then reboot the computer.
   101
