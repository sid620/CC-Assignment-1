     1	Boston, MA -- February 11, 1992 -- At NetWorld 92 Boston, XTree Company
     2	(Booth #430) will introduce its latest version of XTreeNet -- its file
     3	management utility for Novell networks. The company has added new features
     4	and revamped its licensing policy, making it more cost efficient for
     5	administrators of large networks with multiple server environments.
     6	
     7	Shipping now, XTreeNet 2.07 delivers an unprecedented set of file- and disk
     8	management features designed to give complete control of the network to
     9	the administrator. New features include remote control capabilities which
    10	allow users to control other workstations from a single PC. XTreeNet also
    11	offers full support for all NetWare 386 directory and file attributes.
    12	
    13	New Licensing Policy
    14	
    15	Effective immediately, users of XTreeNet 2.07 can purchase server
    16	extensions for only U.S.$100. This means that users no longer have to
    17	purchase additional product in order to access other servers on the
    18	network through XTreeNet. XTree Company decided to revamp its licensing
    19	product in order to make it more cost efficient for administrators of
    20	multiple server environments, explains Brad Bowen, XTree Company Network
    21	Product Manager.
    22	
    23	Like all XTree products, the new XTreeNet Version 2.07 provides the
    24	familiar graphical tree display of a disk's directory structure, allowing
    25	the easy manipulation of files by using the advanced commands found in the
    26	program. XTreeNet 2.07 can also access local drives as well as file server
    27	volumes. In addition, XTreeNet's new peer-to-peer capability allows access
    28	to any workstation on the network, thereby giving the administrator
    29	unparalleled distributed file management capabilities.
    30	
    31	Peer-to Peer Communications
    32	
    33	Using advanced communication techniques, XTreeNet 2.07 can now view and
    34	manipulate files of any workstation on the network. For the first time,
    35	files on distant workstations can be copied, deleted, and edited from one
    36	location. Instead of running from machine to machine, the administrator
    37	can manage the entire network from his desk enabling workstations to be
    38	setup and maintained with the highest level of convenience.
    39	
    40	Other special network capabilities include:
    41	
    42	* log entire or partial drives
    43	* display and modify all NetWare information associated 
    44	  with directories and files
    45	* map network drives 
    46	* send output from any program to any printer on the network
    47	
    48	Advanced File Management Features
    49	
    50	To provide the most complete set of file management capabilities in any
    51	network utility, XTreeNet 2.07 has advanced capabilities for searching and
    52	rapidly finding data in any file or set of files.
    53	
    54	For example, users can search for any group of files for data they need by
    55	specifying any convenient character sequence, such as a name or date they
    56	remember.
    57	
    58	Within seconds, XTreeNet automatically tags all files containing the
    59	specified data string for further file management operations, such as
    60	directly viewing, copying, or modifying parts of these files even when
    61	stored in Lotus 1-2-3, Microsoft Word, WordPerfect, MultiMate, or any
    62	popular data file format.
    63	
    64	The applications which created these files can then be LAUNCHed
    65	automatically. Text can also be GATHERed in blocks from these files and
    66	moved to a printer or directly into another file -- all with simple, easy
    67	keystrokes.
    68	
    69	At the touch of a single key, a split-screen window capability lets users
    70	see and manipulate files in two unrelated directory trees side-by-side. To
    71	speed and simplify repetitive operations, every XTreeNet command maintains
    72	a history for instant recall by either keystroke or click of a mouse
    73	button.
    74	
    75	Another exclusive feature of XTreeNet 2.07 is the Archive command that
    76	saves time, money and valuable hard disk space by compressing files into
    77	the industry standard .ARC format. Compressed files can be transferred to
    78	disks quicker, using fewer diskettes. They can also be sent via modem or
    79	downloaded from on-line services like CompuServe and MCI faster, reducing
    80	telephone costs and on-line access fees.
    81	
    82	Other new features include PRUNE and GRAFT commands, which allow the moving
    83	or deleting of entire directory tree structures as quickly, easily, and
    84	safely as moving a single file.
    85	
    86	XTreeNet 2.07 also provides a powerful, easy-to-use interface to the
    87	network operating system and all other application software through the
    88	use of an application menu. Up to 12 items can be placed on the menu, and
    89	when selected, will execute the commands assigned to that menu. Using the
    90	application menu or the command shell, XTreeNet can collapse to take up a
    91	minimum amount of RAM when other programs are executed.
    92	
    93	Highest Level of Network Security
    94	
    95	In addition to its disk management capabilities, XTreeNet 2.07 also offers
    96	network supervisors the highest level of security available in the network
    97	environment. "XTreeNet's advanced security features are the result of
    98	extensive research with experienced network managers," explains Bowen.
    99	
   100	XTreeNet 2.07 enhances NetWare's security features by allowing the
   101	supervisor to restrict XTreeNet commands to users or groups based upon
   102	their needs in a particular directory. For further file protection, only
   103	the files and directories to which a user has access rights will be shown
   104	in the XTreeNet display.
   105	
   106	Pricing, Availability, Requirements
