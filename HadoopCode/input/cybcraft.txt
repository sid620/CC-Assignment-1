    24			  INTRODUCTION TO CYBERCRAFT
    25	 
    26	     Up to this point in human history WoMankind has taken itself
    27	to the brink of doom and returned with most of our parts intact.
    28	That is our physical members are somewhat healthy. But our minds,
    29	our psyches have suffered.  And we are racing toward the time of
    30	mutation. Some of humanities minds are mutating already.  These
    31	minds and the resulting bodies will offer us a map into our
    32	future.
    33	 
    34	     The future calls us.  It calls us in a silent voice from the
    35	primordial deeps of our genetics and minds. The very chemicals
    36	which make up our minds and bodies are signaling a nearing of the
    37	time of transition.  It will be upon us soon and if we aren't
    38	prepared for the Changelings to manifest some humans may well
    39	start another series of witch hunts to eliminate these precious
    40	few new humans. Indeed it is in the best interest of Four Circuit
    41	humans to stifle the advantageous mutations. Otherwise Four
    42	Circuit humans will be quickly overcome.
    43	 
    44	     Already the Changelings may be about. Their wisdom has
    45	alerted them to the possibility of persecution.  The Hidden Ones
    46	do well to keep their existence unknown until the time of Knowing
    47	has been reached.
    48	 
    49	     But we all won't mutate together or at the same time.  We
    50	have a responsibility to those that will follow us to create a
    51	framework in which they may progress toward positive results. It
    52	is to these ends that the authors are creating a framework to take
    53	Eight Circuit humans into and beyond the time of transition.
    54	 
    55	     With a small electro-chemical voice we are being urged to
    56	communicate with you the possibilities of the current mind
    57	mutation. From this brief amateurish work we will develop a
    58	framework to help assist all inquiring Four Circuit humans on the
    59	path to the next stage of transition. CyberCraft is a path toward
    60	the transition.  It is not the only path either. And indeed we
    61	will probably discover competing organizations.  Some may hinder,
    62	others may assist the transition. From our pursers we ask only to
    63	be left alone in peace. We are not going to harm, only progress.
    64	Peace to you and yours.
    65	 
    66	     Hence we present you with a viable framework to approach the
    67	transition.  That framework is CyberCraft. The craft of piloting
    68	oneself through troubles to reach the point of transition.
    69	 
    70	     This is the first printed introduction and explanation of
    71	CyberCraft. In Colorado Springs on October 6th of 1987, I was
    72	initiated into an eclectic coven of Witches. Previously I was an
    73	ardent Born Again Christian from the Bible Belt of the South. Over
    74	time I came to discover the Christian Belief System, the CBS,
    75	didn't satisfy my personal needs. However after personal searching
    76	and synchronous meetings I was accepted into an intimate group of
    77	exciting and very wonderfully witchey people.
    78	 
    79	     Two years later in 1989 I felt that the most important and
    80	life changing aspects of Witchcraft were being misrepresented.
    81	American Witchcraft, among many other things, is an adaptation of
    82	a primitive form of group therapy, of extending one's immediate
    83	family, of resource sharing and most importantly, a better way of
    84	thinking.  But even after many years of practice, longtime
    85	initiates seem to not understand the basis of American Witchcraft.
    86	 
    87	     Herein is the first publication of CyberCraft, an addition
    88	and update to American Witchcraft. CyberCraft is not meant to
    89	replace Wicca or the Craft. It is meant to interpret the metaphor
    90	further and provide the needed time and energy for other deeply
    91	needed works.
    92	 
    93	     That's at least what this author perceives. I'm sure I'll
    94	receive some criticism for trying to add to or improve American
    95	Witchcraft.
    96	 
    97	     Which brings up the very valid question. Why attempt to
    98	update American Witchcraft when it seems to be doing so well?
    99	There are many reasons. Some of them are:
   100	
   101	o to provide a more expansive framework for the initiates to work
   102	  in.
   103	o to accelerate the trend toward some magikal social threshold,
   104	o to emphasize the really interesting aspects of the craft,
   105	o to further empower the individual,
   106	o to streamline the philosophy,
   107	o to bring it more in line with current psychology,
   108	o to weld the cosmology with current and progressive astronomy and
   109	  physics and finally,
   110	o to provide a more reasonable path of personal growth while
   111	  having fun.
   112	 
   113	     These are just some of the reasons. We also have a duty to
   114	align ourselves with the future, to protect and nurture the new
   115	arrivals. Among our children will come the Changelings. And if we
   116	gain the power to reincarnate purposefully we ourselves may indeed
   117	become The Children of the Changelings.
   118	     
   119	     The first chapter is the proposal. This has been published in
   120	draft form on several national computer networks as Cyber Wicca.
   121	However after some lengthy discussion with my partner we came to
   122	the conclusion that Cyber Wicca was too limiting and not
   123	descriptive enough of our efforts. The real commodity is now in
   124	your hands as CyberCraft.
   125	 
   126	     The second chapter is a description of the lower four bio-
   127	circuits as talked about by Robert Anton Wilson, a.k.a.  RAW.
   128	These bio-circuits are extremely important when considering
   129	CyberCraft.  I feel it of vital significance to begin to
   130	understand how and why we think what we think, which of course,
   131	causes us to do.
   132	 
   133	     Chapter Three is Darkmoor. Previously written about as Chapel
   134	Perilous we find it more interesting to call it Darkmoor.
   135	 
   136	     Chapter Four is of the upper four circuits.  These are the
   137	modes or circuits which we are all progressing toward. For once I
   138	feel we have an intelligent and useful map of our futures. History
   139	will be written in reference of what Leary and Wilson have framed
   140	it in. And because of the Semantic-Time Binding nature of the
   141	written word, we'll all benefit.
   142	 
   143	     There are other articles beyond these. Their purpose will be
   144	apparent upon reading them.
   145	 
   146	     Welcome to CyberCraft. We hope that the tradition will
   147	solidify in a satisfying way, offering the participants many
   148	advantages and insights for piloting their little ships through
   149	chaotic seas.
   150	
   151				 -------------
   152	
   153			  CYBERCRAFT -- The Proposal
   154	
   155	CyberCraft--An Interpretative Metaphor
   156	
   157	     Welcome to the CyberCraft Manual. We hope you will enjoy and
   158	benefit from this little exploration into the majikal mind-body
   159	complex.  Our purpose is to help others operate at higher levels
   160	on all planes of life.  It isn't our purpose to help them just
   161	feel better. Witchcraft has some very positive and life affirming
   162	teachings. The authors of this document hope to interpret those
   163	metaphors bringing them into a late 20th century framework from
   164	which we can springboard into the 21st century.
   165	
   166	     However we have strong forces to compete against.  The first
   167	struggle we are involved with is one of the mind-body complex.
   168	Who will control our mind-bodies?  Will it be the Aspirant, the
   169	one looking for a better life, or will it be the Controllers, the
   170	ones with the power and monies to mold our minds to their
   171	purposes? And will we nurture the emerging Changelings?  Or do we
   172	let the Persecutors administer the Last Rite to our offspring?
   173	
   174	     CyberCraft is not meant to be an end in itself.  CyberCraft
   175	is the art of living smart.  We hope that it will offer the
   176	Aspirant the options needed to create a better world to live in.
   177	Additionally CyberCraft is a psycho- spiritual metaphor for the
   178	21st century.  This metaphor is based upon embodiment spirituality
   179	whereas others are based upon disembodiment spirituality.
   180	
   181	     CyberCraft is the art of living that integrates rational and
   182	irrational process through mythopoetic structures primarily from
   183	Wicca, then neo-Paganism and other related religious belief
   184	systems.  It should incorporate knowledge from newer and emerging
   185	humanistic sciences.  Principles of ethical self-programming as
   186	written of by Timothy Leary, John Lilly, Robert Anton Wilson,
   187	Antero Alli, and Christopher Hyatt should be incorporated into the
   188	relational processes; those setting between solar and lunar
   189	knowledge.  CyberCraft is a self-modifying tradition.  It will
   190	change as culture changes.  CyberCraft is also a psycho-spiritual
   191	metaphor which will generate, sanctify and venerate the necessary
   192	tools for enjoying a healthy mind and body.
   193	      
   194	     The above mentioned authors are helping to shed light upon
   195	our thought processes. The terms and structures they use should be
   196	considered metaphorical.  But they provide a viable framework from
   197	which to build a newer, more appropriate belief system for our
   198	times.
   199	
   200	     Humans seem to have a need to be both rational and irrational
   201	at the same time. In doing so we generate quite a few problems and
   202	reap some benefits. At this point in human time we are not able to
   203	measure magik, nor are we able to measure or sense the so called
   204	etheric or astral. Providing that we are given time and if the
   205	interests are still mounted, we may be able to invent measuring or
   206	sensing devices for such indeterminate quantities.
   207	
   208	     Further the practice of dividing the mind from the body has
   209	broken sunder the human even further.  For the purposes of
   210	CyberCraft the mind-body is one complex, one swirl of energy. The
   211	mind and body are one entity, undivided, inseparable, and
   212	indivisible.
   213	
   214	     It is the opinion of this author that many features of the
   215	powers are misunderstood. Over the centuries and in various
   216	cultures humans have overlaid folk fables and their personal
   217	expectations of what the powers are into the framework of human
   218	abilities. And in doing so needless baggage has crept into the
   219	consensus framework.  It is time that we looked at our human
   220	nature without the clouded and marred lens of binary, Christian,
   221	Ceremonial and patriarchal expectations.
   222	
   223	     At the base of the concern humans are animal by definition.
   224	Human magik should firstly be animal magik.  But does that mean we
   225	should be satisfied with an animal expectation of what our
   226	abilities can be? Should we push back the normal or natural
   227	boundaries? How far?
   228	
   229	     The first order of business is to know ourselves. Does this
   230	mean know just our bodies?  How about desires? How about hopes,
   231	dreams and aspirations?  How about our minds? Why should we remain
   232	ignorant of why and how we think? Do we know now? Or do we think
   233	we know without really knowing?  What part do preconceived
   234	concepts play in the formulation of that sentiment? How do our
   235	respective cultures help us define our consciousness?  Are these
   236	definitions useful?  What can be replaced? With what?
   237	
   238	     It is useful to frame these questions in the milieu of the
   239	human mind.  Everything we can think of is thought with the bio-
   240	computer we term the brain.  How does the brain work?  Research
   241	effort is still in progress but at the core we find that the brain
   242	is composed of billions of cell bundles called neurons.  Each
   243	neuron could have as many as 10,000 gateways to other neurons.  We
   244	know that information is transmitted electro-chemically at about
   245	.07 volts.  But we don't know everything yet. And least of all we
   246	don't know why we think what we think.
   247	     
   248	     CyberCraft should be a psychological-religious-political
   249	thought system to meet and support the needs of individuals who
   250	feel both a romantic and classical approach is needed in their
   251	life.  These needs should be formatted into solar and lunar
   252	knowledge bases, ie., rational and irrational modes with
   253	relational processes sitting midway betwixt them.  These should be
   254	used to a maximal degree.
   255	
   256	     Humans are discovering that there is pity poor little
   257	difference between political and religious systems. In fact
   258	religious systems replace the tribal chief or monarch with a
   259	discarnate chief or monarch.  This eases the task of governing the
   260	populace through the revelations and commandments of the
   261	discarnate and absent ruler from on high. Humans always fear most
   262	what they cannot see, understand or comprehend. And we always fear
   263	the invisible punisher; the inner punisher who knows our greatest
   264	fears.  Consequently religious systems are political systems of a
   265	supplementary order.  Political systems should be considered
   266	metareligious systems in that political concerns lay at the base
   267	of or stand behind religious concerns. Religious systems are
   268	political systems of an inner nature.
   269	
   270	     Understanding our thoughts should become a little easier in
   271	the solar (daylight consciousness) and lunar (twilight
   272	consciousness) framework.  Additionally many other modes of
   273	consciousness could be mounted which straddle these tropes.  These
   274	should be termed the relational or relative processes.
   275	
   276	     Electronic and chemical assistance for modifying
   277	consciousness might be useful in helping to determine how
   278	individuals might drive ethically chosen programming deep into the
   279	psyche.  But once the message is received we should hang the phone
   280	up on chemical boosters. A new generation of brain machine is on
   281	the market today.  Recently we have had the opportunity to test
   282	drive a model of the audio-visual and suggestion type. The
   283	experience was positive.
   284	
   285	     CyberCraft should incorporate many of the concepts contained
   286	in Humanist Manifesto II.
   287	
   288	     Secular humanists have pioneered many valuable ideas needful
   289	in today's ever evolving political and social environments.
   290	CyberNauts should augment some humanistic concepts with high
   291	technology answers to pressing personal questions. And in applying
   292	technology to human service systems we might make a difference not
   293	only in our little corner of the planet but elsewhere.
   294	
   295	     CyberCraft should foster a new class of technology termed
   296	GreenTech.  GreenTech should be those technologies which recycle
   297	and/or conserve the Matrix's natural resources.
   298	
   299	     CyberCraft is a new psycho-spiritual system that is more
   300	importantly a mode of thinking.  Smart thinking usually leads to
   301	smart living.  Additionally the application of CyberCraft to
   302	mundane life should be easy and seamless.  Instead of taking the
   303	individual out of the social complex it should enable them to
   304	integrate easily with the social composite.
   305	
   306	     All human structures spawn from the human mind.  More
   307	powerful modes of thinking are needed to help us along our way in
   308	an ever increasingly propaganda polluted knowledge environment.
   309	We should take into our own hands the facilities to make rational,
   310	relative and irrational decisions void of fear of the outcome and
   311	infatuation of the process.
   312	
   313	     CyberCraft should appeal to the atheist as well as the
   314	religionist as it focuses upon mythopoetic stories and structures
   315	and the mystical connections between what is and is not seen, as
   316	opposed to dogmatic theoretical structures.  CyberCraft emphasizes
   317	relationship over religion. This author believes that most of the
   318	world's religions are based upon self-deception. These self-
   319	deceptions are usually meant to smooth difficult passages in life.
   320	But we should be honest with ourselves. To know ourselves we have
   321	to cope well with those human events that cause us much pain.
   322	Instead of telling ourselves pretty fairytales we need to work in
   323	harmony with our natures.  But first we need to know what our
   324	nature is. And then with greater understanding we can modify that
   325	nature.
   326	
   327	     The archetypes of Wicca, paganism and other systems should be
   328	thought of as patterns usefull for programming the human
   329	experience and the relationships between the various existant
   330	lifeforms.
   331	
   332	     In Scott Peck's book A DIFFERENT DRUMMER he surmises the
   333	following transitions for the religiously oriented.
   334	
   335	     First is a stage of naivete in which the human mind/body
   336	complex is not programed.
   337	
   338	     Then follows a phase of organization in which the mind/body
   339	complex is programed by an acceptable religious structure.  Over
   340	time the individual discovers that the religious structure is
   341	focused in ways undesirable to the follower. Stick is mounted upon
   342	stone until a way of escape is formulated which provides an
   343	honorable withdrawal.
   344	
   345	     Sometime afterwards the individual discovers they are bitter
   346	because of some single or multiple set of experiences. This stage
   347	is marked by some form of agnosticism or atheism.  It's a
   348	rejection of the organized systems which tend to exploit the
   349	seeker, the single, the separate and lonely for financial and
   350	political gains.
   351	
   352	     Still the seeker needs to feel they are a part of something
   353	greater than the individual alone. A mystic phase encroaches
   354	whereupon a glimmer of hope is seen in the natural intricacies of
   355	life. Generally the mystic phase has an eclectic twist as the bio-
   356	computer selectively compares, accepts and rejects concepts and
   357	structures which are useful or not.  This experience is intensely
   358	personal.  In many cases the experience is not expressible as
   359	words to describe the framework are found wanting.
   360	
   361	     Theoretical structures should be included as long as they are
   362	considered metaphorical structures or models existing within the
   363	human mind first and foremost. These structures can then be used
   364	to ferret out deep personal meaning.
   365	
   366	     The paragraph above is the patented anti-dogma catma. The
   367	catma is needed to remind us the menu is not the meal; that mental
   368	apprehensions of a reality are not the realities themselves. Meow!
   369	A valuable demonstration of this is the simple exercise of saying
   370	aloud the word pinch. Then give the your arm a good pinch. Think
   371	about the difference.
   372	
   373				 -------------
   374	
   375	External Faces--Public
   376	
   377	     Domains
   378	
   379	     Domains are used metaphorically. More properly they represent
   380	areas of interest. Higher and lower relate to density more than
   381	social, cultural or ethical placement.  However higher and lower
   382	still display some cultural heritage.  Higher should normally
   383	refer to more dense, and thus would usually be considered the
   384	Lower Kingdoms in most disembodiment or spirit focused theoretical
   385	structures. For the purposes of CyberCraft solar processes can be
   386	considered High Domain Processes, the relational processes as the
   387	Mid Domain processes and the lunar processes as Low Domain
   388	Processes.
   389	
   390	     This is a reversal of the usual spirit based structures which
   391	drive the initiate into seclusion and poverty.  CyberCraft need be
   392	neither ascetic nor bothersome. If CyberCraft arrives at a
   393	framework which is not enjoyable the CyberCraft needs to die and
   394	be reborn.
   395	
   396	     Higher refers to the relative density of matter.  The human
   397	sciences are more appropriate for humans, the spirit sciences more
   398	appropriate for spirits.  In the high domains herbal lore and
   399	self- help topics are more the rule than the exception.
   400	
   401	     Religious Aspects--Low Domain
   402	
   403	     The metaphorical Low Domain is the domain of Relationship.
   404	It's the basis of the religious belief system should reflect
   405	WoMankind's ethical relationship to their home planet and
   406	humanity.  Depending upon personal focus the Earth can be
   407	personified or considered the Grandmother or Mother of WoMankind.
   408	It should be called Gaea, Gaia, Mom, Mother or the Matrix, the
   409	space enabling the existence of all physical and non-physical
   410	local planetary lifeforms.  The involved solar processes should
   411	consider this a "self check" to prohibit WoMankind from polluting
   412	their environment to the detriment of all lifeforms.
   413	
   414	     Other Matrixes may exist. CyberCraft should be concerned with
   415	local planetary manifestations without denying the existences of
   416	other Matrixes.
   417	     
   418	     The Matrix is paired with Patrus, which is symbolic of
   419	everything which has happened to and upon the Matrix. Included
   420	phenomena are geologic events, meteorological events, intrusions
   421	from outside the Matrix, meteor impacts, panspermia arrivals and
   422	direct interventions of space faring races. In a sense the Patrus
   423	can be thought of as the evolutional processes or history of all
   424	life on the Matrix. Where the Matrix and Patrus overlap, intersect
   425	or connect, life forms.
   426	
   427	     Other personified or romantic entities should exist within
   428	the matrix.  These should be the Lady and Lord and be more
   429	important or of a relatively more immediate nature being seen as
   430	doorways to other entities, other spaces, physical energetic
   431	natures or psychic spaces. Frequently the Lady and Lord should be
   432	celebrated as the perfect patterns of WoMankind. Matrix and Patrus
   433	along with Lady and Lord should be remembered at every fullmoon
   434	celebration.
   435	
   436	     Working of the Craft--Mid Domain
   437	
   438	     The metaphorical Mid Domain should be the workings of the
   439	Craft. At first the emphasis should be upon physical
   440	representations of the Mid Domain.  Special tools should be
   441	selected for an individual or group. These tools may or may not
   442	reflect traditional usage but should be more appropriate for a
   443	culture and/or geographical locale than for a traditional usage.
   444	
   445	     Special robes may be appropriate.  Nudity should be more
   446	useful for metaprograming.  The individual's background should be
   447	considered before choosing tools or coverings. If the individual
   448	were normally a naturist the metaprograming tool could be robes,
   449	etc.
   450	
   451	     Tools and rituals should be used for immediate metaprograming
   452	efforts.  Dramatic ritual should be used to advantage for both
   453	individual programming or group alignment.
   454	
   455	     Experiments in communication with non-physical or discarnate
   456	entities should be a focus. New modes of relationship in sexual or
   457	emotional life should be incorporated providing members feel
   458	comfortable with the activities. Safety, both physical and
   459	emotional, should be paramount. Training of individuals for
   460	incorporation may be needed to assist them in their growth into
   461	unknown areas.
   462	
   463	     An important focus of the Mid Domian is the creation and
   464	maintainence of Will. Today's human has been robbed of Will.
   465	Cybercraft hopes to generate and utilize appropriate ritual and
   466	programming techniques to accomplish this goal.
   467	
   468	     Incorporated Physical Sciences--High Domain
   469	
   470	     The metaphorical High Domain should be the human and physical
   471	knowledge systems, ie, health (birthing, child care and physical
   472	health), nutritional, exercise, cosmetic and creative knowledge
   473	systems, ie.  sewing, cooking, building sciences, gardening and
   474	organic farming techniques, and personal defense techniques.
   475	
   476	     CyberCraft should initially provide the framework for
   477	immersion in a Domain. The individual or group should decide for
   478	themselves what extent they need to go.
   479	
   480	    Organization
   481	
   482	    CyberCraft should attempt to incorporate proven techniques of
   483	cell or smaller group management while retaining intimacy.
   484	CyberCraft leaders could be of either sex, of any sexual
   485	preference, but must be emotionally sound. They may choose their
   486	own names and titles.  Or CyberCraft may assign a title in order
   487	to establish a somewhat formalized but unrestricted tradition. We
   488	suggest these classifications:
   489	
   490	     Aspirant        -- an inquiring mind of reasonably good
   491	                        health,
   492	     CyberNaut       -- a human moving from Four to Eight
   493	                        Circuits, an apprentice CyberPriest/ess, 
   494	     CyberPriest/ess -- a fully functioning Eight Circuit human,
   495	     Transitioner    -- a young or eight circuit human showing
   496	                        signs of physical metamorphosis,
   497	     New Human       -- a fully functioning transitioned human,
   498	                        and
   499	     Cyberim         -- the total complex of those practicing
   500	                        CyberCraft.
   501	
   502	     Group or cell size should be held to about 2 to 15. However
   503	any number of cell members may be used providing genuine intimacy
   504	is maintained.
   505	
   506	     CyberCraft should attempt to meet the economic and political
   507	needs of its members. Resources are available that address
   508	political activities in cells. An economic infrastructure must be
   509	established in CyberCraft method. Should a social threat arise
   510	individual members may need to support themselves in a strange or
   511	difficult environment.  Personal enrichment and empowerment as
   512	opposed to personal aggrandizement should be the focus enabling
   513	the member to live well in any difficult or strange economic or
   514	political environment.
   515	
   516	     Emotional Requirements
   517	
   518	     What part does love play in CyberCraft?  Love in its various
   519	shades and flavors permeate CyberCraft.  From love of Mother and
   520	Father, to love of knowledge and wisdom, to the lust and love of
   521	ones lover, on to love of pleasure of the mind-body complex, love
   522	of the patterns one manifests through, including the love of
   523	changing one's world to finally the love of navigating the non-
   524	local passages between the worlds. Yes love plays a vital part.
   525	But we are not so naive to assume that only one type of love
   526	exists.  Many different shades and flavors make up this rainbow of
   527	emotion.  CyberCraft should experience and emphasize as many
   528	different forms of love as possible.
   529	
   530				 -------------
   531	
   532	Internal Faces
   533	
   534	     These are internal considerations not usually presentable to
   535	the public at large. Pearls are delicate. We need not dirty them.
   536	Internal faces can be determined at a later time.
   537	
   538	     CyberCraft is a game; the game of Life. Play it!

   541			     Thinkers and Provers:
   542			     the Care and Feeding
   543			   of the Human Bio-Computer
   544	
   545	Editor's note: The following is a loosely paraphrased summary
   546	of Robert Anton Wilson's first chapters in PROMETHEUS RISING,
   547	(Falcon Press 1983)
   548	
   549	The Circuits
   550	
   551	     The following model of human consciousness employs a metaphor
   552	termed the bio-circuit and a psycho-stat.  Each bio-circuit,
   553	sometimes referred as circuits, and a psycho-stats functions much
   554	the same as the channel selector and volume control on your home
   555	stereo. In our electro-colloidal processor we call a brain we have
   556	physical connections, the physical neurons that contains our
   557	memories and processes our thoughts and the information
   558	connections, the meaning that is stored in those connections. When
   559	we think a thought or react to some stimulus we use these circuits
   560	by default. We literally don't know things that we don't know and
   561	cannot do things we haven't learned.  The bio-circuits are the
   562	programs which govern the thoughts and actions we employ in our
   563	daily life. The psycho-stats are the controls which allow
   564	acceleration or deceleration, the intensification and diminishing
   565	of the bio-circuits. Via the use of a psycho-stat we can emerse
   566	ourselves in a bio-circuit or turn the intensity down to just a
   567	trickle. We have a choice in how deeply we experience a circuit.
   568	
   569	     It is our experience with others whom we share the CyberCraft
   570	metaphor that just knowing where one is on the map enables the
   571	CynerNaut to pilot their way to other circuits and manipulate the
   572	psycho-stats to make their lives more enjoyable.
   573	
   574	The Model
   575	 
   576	   What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves.  This was stated
   577	emphatically by Dr. Lenard Orr. Because the human brain, like
   578	other animal brains, acts as an electro-colloidal computer, not as
   579	a solid state computer, it follows the same laws as other animal
   580	brains. That is, organically driven programs get into the brain as
   581	electro-chemical bonds, in discrete organic quantum stages.
   582	 
   583	   This is not to say that the human brain is a computer, but only
   584	that it acts something like a solid state computer.  The computer
   585	model best fits current knowledge. Let's review just briefly what
   586	we know about solid state computers.
   587	
   588	   A solid state computer has two chief components, hardware and
   589	software. Of these the hardware portion is the physical part. It
   590	consists of five necessary parts: a device to process information,
   591	the Central Processing Unit (CPU), an input device to send
   592	instructions to the CPU, the keyboard, an output device for
   593	receiving messages from the CPU, the display or printer, a
   594	temporary storage area for the CPU, the memory, and a permanent
   595	information storage device, the floppy or hard disk.
   596	
   597	   In this hardware model the brain acts like a computer in that
   598	it receives, processes, transmits and files information. And like
   599	the solid state computer the devices or individual parts of the
   600	brain or computer are discrete and manipulatable either by
   601	electro- chemical processes or mechanical force.  The discrete
   602	elements can be created, modified or destroyed easily in one place
   603	and at one time.
   604	
   605	   The other component is software.  These are the instructions
   606	given to the computer to operate upon. They, (software is
   607	generally plural in nature), exist both inside and outside the
   608	computer simultaneously.  While one can easily locate the hardware
   609	in space- time, the software is more ephemeral; it can be in many
   610	different places at one time.  One can destroy the hardware while
   611	the software(s) live on unhampered.
   612	
   613	   Of the softwares there are two basic types of software,
   614	operating systems and applications.  Operating systems, sometimes
   615	called monitors or master control programs, are the backbones of
   616	software. All applications travel through the backbones to their
   617	appointed ends.  Applications are the individual instructions that
   618	cause the CPU to compute, to make decisions and move information
   619	around.
   620	
   621	Brainware
   622	
   623	   "What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves." Today we have a
   624	better idea of how the brain works than ever before. I'll get to
   625	the hardware aspects in a later section.  First I'm mostly
   626	concerned with the software aspects of the human brain.
   627	
   628	   The brain software, or brainware, has three basic parts:
   629	
   630	   IMPRINTS--These are the more-or-less hardwired (physically
   631	present electro-chemical connected) programs which the brain is
   632	genetically suited to accept ONLY at certain points in its
   633	development. These points are known, in ethology, as times of
   634	"imprint vulnerability."  Imprinting is involuntary by nature.
   635	
   636	   CONDITIONING--These are programs built onto the imprints. They
   637	are looser and fairly easy to change with counter- conditioning.
   638	Conditioning is relatively more voluntary than imprinting.
   639	
   640	   LEARNING--This is even looser and "softer" than conditioning.
   641	Learning is relatively more voluntary than conditioning.
   642	
   643	   Generally, the primordial imprint can always overrule any
   644	subsequent conditioning and/or learning. An imprint is a type of
   645	software that has become built in hardware, termed "firmware" in
   646	computer jargon, being impressed upon tender neurons before they
   647	were fully developed, or modified at some point when they are
   648	singularly vulnerable. Imprinting is extremely difficult to change
   649	once the imprint has been made. Some think that imprinting is
   650	impossible to change, period.
   651	
   652	   Imprints are the non-negotiable aspects of our individuality.
   653	Out of the infinite possibilities of programs existing as
   654	potential brainware, the imprint establishes the limits,
   655	parameters, perimeters within which all subsequent conditioning
   656	and learning must occur.
   657	
   658	   Before imprinting the consciousness of the infant is a clean
   659	slate, it's "formless and void".  Another analogue is the exploded
   660	or unconditioned consciousness the mystics call enlightenment.
   661	When the first imprint is made structure begins to take form. The
   662	emergent mind becomes trapped within this imprinting structure; it
   663	identifies with the structure. And in a sense it becomes the
   664	structure.
   665	
   666	   Each successive imprinting adds to and complicates the previous
   667	imprintings.  Through part of this "deep brainware" we experience
   668	life events which are interpreted in light of the existing
   669	imprintings.
   670	
   671	   Further, conditioning and learning add branches to this basic
   672	framework of imprintings. The total structure of this brain
   673	circuitry makes up our world map and our worldviews. In essence we
   674	experience our realities in reference to and in accordance with
   675	the software in our brains. The reality we know is one that is a
   676	construction established and maintained in our brains, our minds.
   677	In this mental-macrostructure the Thinker thinks and the Provers
   678	proves mechanistically, fitting all the information into
   679	previously existing frameworks.
   680	
   681	Brainware Centers--The Bio-Circuits
   682	
   683	   RAW slightly modifies Dr. Timothy Leary's previous 8 bio-
   684	circuits.  It's rather important to remember that the following
   685	descriptions are metaphors.  They are something akin to the menu's
   686	representation of the meal. It's apparent that the menu isn't very
   687	tasty or nutritious. Please remember that each of the following
   688	Circuits can be affected either positively or negatively for any
   689	conceivable reason to any accidental or intended end.

   716	Circuit IV	Moralistic    Lover/Parent
   717		Relationship to Sex/Lover/Parent 
   718	
   719	Circuit One--Oral
   720	
   721	   Circuit One is the center which most closely approximates the
   722	perspectives we have about our bodies. Should a bodily threat
   723	occur we automatically and completely retreat into Circuit One
   724	operations.  "I didn't think about it, my body just moved," the
   725	pugilist says. When such a retreat into Circuit One happens, all
   726	other centers are bypassed instantly. Circuit One is the first and
   727	oldest circuit to operate. Some call it the reptile brain. Its
   728	earmarks are complete automatic movement and unthinking reaction
   729	to a physical influence.
   730	
   731	   At birth the first imprinting is that of Mother. Anything can
   732	be imprinted as Mother. Wild animals have been known to imprint
   733	such things as animals of other species, Ping-pong balls and
   734	Jeeps.  Accidents, intrusions and intended events can all affect
   735	imprinting at this level. Additional imprinting can occur later in
   736	life when a bodily threat occurs. Areas of interest for Circuit
   737	One are the health fields, martial arts and any interest which
   738	stimulates or depresses the human body.
   739	
   740	     Sometimes this circuit gets out of control.  We leave the
   741	psycho-stat turned fully on or nearly off. Then it is possible to
   742	imagine threats to the body that have no basis in reality. The
   743	results can be quite tragic.
   744	
   745	Circuit Two--Anal
   746	
   747	   Circuit Two is the next imprinting stage.  Once the child
   748	learns to move around it encounters others. The immediate Circuit
   749	Two imprinting involves authority. Typically this is symbolized by
   750	Father. The child first imprints its relationship with Mother,
   751	sharing bodies and food. The second imprinting is of its
   752	relationship to Father. Now there aren't two things in its
   753	universe, there are three. Along with the imprinting of Father is
   754	authority conditioning. If the child does something "good" or
   755	"bad" it learns that Mom and Dad can do something. From this
   756	triangle political situations arise. How quickly the child learns
   757	family politics!
   758	
   759	   Authority effects personal elimination--potty training.
   760	Personal elimination requires more precise control of the body.
   761	Mom and Dad use their power and authority to condition the child's
   762	personal elimination.  This circuit is normally extended out into
   763	the great big human world with rules, regulations, laws and
   764	politics.  Bodily excretion is replaced with ink and electronic
   765	excretions. It's appropriate to refer to this as an anal stage.
   766	And it's not surprising that military and political personel refer
   767	to themselves with "shit" or "ass". "Gotta' get my ass outta'
   768	here", "cover your ass, pal," "you asinine idiot," and "you shit
   769	head" are typical references to the self and others.  Where
   770	authoritarian or political concerns arise the human mind retreats
   771	into Circuit two for instruction. Areas of interest for Circuit
   772	Two are of course authority structures, the family, the penal
   773	system, the military and politics in general.
   774	
   775	   Generally Circuit Two social problems are dealt with by
   776	threatening Circuit One, either with bodily incarceration or by
   777	threatening removal of bio-survival tickets (money).
   778	
   779	Circuit Three--Semantic Time Binding
   780	
   781	   Circuit Three takes us out of the physical world into the
   782	abstract. Once the child learns to speak,it senses its
   783	relationship to symbols. It must learn to symbolize, to describe
   784	the abstract.  Circuit Three is a center which utilizes and
   785	manipulates ideas, concepts, facts and figures.
   786	
   787	   It's tempting to refer to Circuit Three as "the Mind".  But it
   788	isn't. The primary expressive organ for this circuit is the mouth,
   789	the portal from which symbols, concepts and ideas tumble.  In
   790	consensus reality WoMankind uses the artificial distinction of
   791	mind and body. The mind is the body and the body is the mind.
   792	
   793	   Korzybski said those who rule symbols rule us. Humans beings
   794	(domesticated) primates are symbol-using creatures.
   795	
   796	   If Moses, Confucius, Buddha, Mohammad, Jesus and St.  Paul can
   797	be considered living influences, and they most certainly are for
   798	many, then it is because their "signal", their meaning has been
   799	transmitted across time and space to our little corner of the
   800	world. Their meaning and purpose has been transmitted to us by
   801	symbol systems. These systems include words, artworks, music,
   802	rituals and unrecognized rituals, ie. "games" through which
   803	culture is transmitted.  Marx and Hitler, Newton and Socrates,
   804	Shakespeare and Jefferson, etc, continue to rule parts of humanity
   805	in the same way--through the semantic circuit. It then becomes
   806	plainly obvious that the symbol system conditions the information
   807	transmitted and thereby conditions the mind which receives
   808	conditioned information.
   809	
   810	   We are ruled even more, and even less consciously, by the
   811	inventors of the wheel, the plow, the alphabet(s), even the
   812	various engineers of roads throughout history. The founders, the
   813	religious engineers of the world religions rule us through their
   814	creations, conditioning our minds to accept their message and
   815	reject others.
   816	
   817	   Circuit Three is time binding in that it provides a reference
   818	>from one point in time to another point. It is also used to
   819	subdivide and reconnect things, at pleasure. There seems to be no
   820	end of the busy analyze, synthesize, create, divide and rejoin,
   821	labeling and packaging of experience. This is the internal
   822	monologue which is then externalized into the continuum. On the
   823	historical level this is the time-binding aspect as one generation
   824	adds to or subtracts from the sum total of human knowledge and
   825	experience.
   826	
   827	   Since words contain both denotations (referents in the sensory-
   828	existential world) and connotations (emotional tones and poetic or
   829	rhetorical hooks), humans can be moved to action even by words
   830	which have no real meaning or reference in actuality. This is the
   831	mechanism of demagoguery, advertising, and much of organized
   832	religion.
   833	
   834	   Circuit Three can run away.  The psy-stat turned way too high.
   835	Persons involved with the higher circuits (V-VIII) tell us that
   836	"reason is a whore", ie. the semantic circuit is notoriously
   837	vulnerable to manipulation by the older, more primitive circuits.
   838	However the rationalist may resent this, it is always true in the
   839	short run. That is, it is always pragmatically true.
   840	
   841	   Circuit Three can become so idealistic, so revolutionary that a
   842	society cannot cope with the rapid change. Generally a society
   843	deals with such problems by a violent Circuit One or Circuit Four
   844	threat.  Whoever can scare people enough (produce sufficient bio-
   845	survival anxiety or sex guilt) can sell them quickly on any verbal
   846	map that seems to provide the needed relief from the anxiety. Once
   847	either threat is experienced Circuit Three is bypassed, and new
   848	symbols can be plugged into the human computer.
   849	
   850	     More will be said later about Circuit Three and its
   851	associations with what Richard Dawkins refers to as memes.
   852	
   853	Circuit Four--Moral
   854	
   855	   Circuit Four is the next center of operation or mode of
   856	thought.  This center is approximated by the sex hormones
   857	awakening in the teen's body. Once a sexual awakening occurs
   858	society has a perceived duty to regulate sexual expression. This
   859	circuit could be called the Guilt Circuit since it is mostly used
   860	to control individuals, not enhance human life.
   861	
   862	   Imprint vulnerability is acute. The first sexual signals to
   863	turn on the adolescent nervous system remain fixed for life,
   864	defining the individual's sexuality. They lurch about, the
   865	bewildered possessors of new bodies awakening to a new rhythm.
   866	Sex!
   867	
   868	   As any adult can tell, this time is delicate. Accidents do
   869	happen which lend to the general imprinting which may or may not
   870	contribute to a positive experience. Accidents which impinge upon
   871	this imprint are just as effective as fully intended ones. Yet
   872	time moves on. The individual's sexuality develops.  Parents and
   873	peers all have a say in the conditioning.  Schools play a part in
   874	the learning process with sex education. Society itself takes a
   875	guiding role in Circuit Four defining what is and is not
   876	acceptable in our activities.
   877	
   878	   Circuit Four can be used in two ways to regulate other
   879	circuits.  A Circuit Three social concern can be alleviated by
   880	threatening Circuit Four. Take away a human's opportunity for sex
   881	and they will consider their options.  A still more useful way to
   882	modify an individual's behavior is to threaten their children.
   883	Circuit Four is the Parent stage. Society both enhances and
   884	threatens the parent with beneficial social programs while hinting
   885	at removal of benefits and children.
   886	
   887	Circuit Tasking
   888	 
   889	  The task of the CyberNaut is to employ a psycho-stat to
   890	accelerate and decelerate all Circuits in such a way as to provide
   891	optimal protection from outside influences, liberate the circuit
   892	for newer, better working, and optimize the imprinting,
   893	conditioning and learning to ethical ends chosen by the CyberNaut.
   894	By using metaprogramming exercises for each circuit we can
   895	willfully fine tune each circuit so that our perspectives and
   896	actions closer match consensus reality. Or we may skillfully
   897	explore those areas which interest us the most.
   898	
   899	Conclusion
   900	 
   901	   What the Thinker thinks the Prover proves.  Whatever our
   902	perspective of our bodies, our reputations, or our philosophical
   903	stance and our sexuality we prove to ourselves that what we think
   904	is accurate.  Fortunately we now know what affects the internal
   905	programming. That makes it much easier to modify our very beings
   906	for a more optimal life, more enjoyable existience.
   907	
   908	   The above descriptions are of the lower four Circuits.  The
   909	intent of the article was to inform.  Much work needs to be done
   910	in the way of positively integrating these ancient centers for a
   911	better life.  It's time we took control of the reins of our lives.
   912	Long have the medias, the political-religious propaganda machines,
   913	our peers and loved ones manipulated us toward goals previously
   914	selected.  The task of the CyberNaut is to holistically and
   915	positively reimprint, recondition and relearn toward a purpose of
   916	their own.
   917	
   918	     Between the lower and upper circuits lays a period of doubt
   919	which we term Darkmoor.
   920	
   921					 -------------
   922	
   923	   In the next article we will review the Upper Four Circuits.
   924	They are:
   925	
   926	   5. The Holistic Neurosomatic Circuit.
   927	   6. The Collective Neurogenetic Circuit.
   928	   7. The Metaprogramming Circuit.
   929	   8. The Non-Local Quantum Circuit.
   930	
   931					 -------------
   932	
   933	                            Darkmoor
   934	
   935	     Between the lower and upper circuits lies a place of
   936	uncertainty and fear. It has many names but the CyberNaut refers
   937	to this place as Darkmoor. When the individual, through life's
   938	events or dedicated study, learns of the existence of newer,
   939	better states of mind there typically follows with a time of
   940	uncertainty.
   941	
   942	     Why do I feel this way? Am I crazy? Will I get in trouble?
   943	What about my family and friends? Will they shun me? What if they
   944	do? These are all typical questions we ask ourselves. Mine was "Am
   945	I demon posessed?" Unfortuantely some 10 years ago I struggled
   946	against the flow. I fought myself in Darkmoor. I became a victim
   947	of my own fearful projections. I became obsessed with the fear of
   948	demonic possession. I was trapped in Darkmoor for ten long years.
   949	
   950	     We feel comfortable in our four circuit lives. Yet some
   951	internal pressure drives us onward toward newer lands. CyberCraft
   952	teaches us that what drives us is into Darkmoor is our genetic
   953	heritage. This is something we are completely unable to constrain
   954	or withhold. Struggling against it is about as effective as the
   955	young teen struggling against their awakening sexuality. And
   956	indeed ignoring the arousal brings on increased states of
   957	emotional dis- ease.
   958	
   959	     Many of the neo-Pagan aficionados have already experienced
   960	this time of uncertainty and proceeded. Goddess religion helps us
   961	to realize that circuit two and four religious establishments are
   962	incomplete because they neglect the body and mind as one unified
   963	entity. The universal processes of life reminds us of that unity.
   964	
   965	     Darkmoor is not a bad place really. It is a time of trying.
   966	A time of using new mental and emotional muscles; stretching old
   967	ones to newer limits; and of growing new links to the Matrix,
   968	Patrus, Lady and Lord. For some folks it is a time of joy and
   969	discovery. For others Darkmoor is indeed very dark.
   970	
   971	     Depending upon one's previous programming a CyberNaut or
   972	CyberPriest/ess can recommend some very simple exercises to help
   973	the Aspirant to overcome previous mistakes. This author suggests
   974	to the Aspirant that quality time while in this area helps to
   975	engender quality experiences elsewhere.
   976	
   977	     Perhaps the best self-integrating rituals would be ones which
   978	include teachings which bring awareness of the upper circuits. In
   979	fact I can't envision a person who would experience harshness in
   980	Darkmoor if they were aware of upper circuit material. However an
   981	individual programmed to see advancement as evil or demonic would
   982	have one hell of a time in Darkmoor.
   983	
   984	     Passage through Darkmoor can be fun and exciting. But one
   985	must become aware of the upper circuits to navigate effectively
   986	through Darkmoor.
   987	
   988	
   989	                  CIRCUITS FIVE THROUGH EIGHT:
   990	                      CONTINUING EVOLUTION
   991	
   992	   Note: The following description of the circuits is a somewhat
   993	paraphrased summary of Robert Anton Wilson's material on the upper
   994	four circuits from his Prometheus Rising (Falcon Press, 1983).
   995	Quotes from Lao Tsu are from the Vintage Books Tao Te Ching,
   996	translated by Gia-fu Feng and Jane English; Zen parables are from
   997	Paul Reps' Zen Flesh, Zen Bones.  The day-to-day applications are
   998	my own.
   999	
  1000	   While Circuits One through Four are present and operative in
  1001	every adult human, activation of the next four circuits is not
  1002	nearly as widespread.  In some, none of these circuits may have
  1003	ever been accessed, while others may occasionally have experiences
  1004	of one or more of the upper circuits.  In any case, as Circuits
  1005	Five through Eight represent newly emerging evolutionary trends,
  1006	they are at present operative only in a relatively small
  1007	percentage of the population.  The CyberNaut seeks to increase
  1008	that percentage.
  1009	
  1010	Circuit Five: The Holistic Neurosomatic Circuit
  1011	
  1012	   This circuit is typified by ecstatic or blissful feelings,
  1013	sensory enhancement, sensual pleasure from even ordinary
  1014	experiences and activities, and a generally blissful, laid-back
  1015	"high" of contentment with the state of things in general.
  1016	Gurdjieff referred to this circuit as the True Magnetic Center.
  1017	Triggering devices include isolation tanks, the Hindu technique of
  1018	pranayama, or controlled breathing, zero-gravity environments,
  1019	and, for the adventurous, Cannabis drugs.  Such experiences as
  1020	spontaneous regeneration or "faith healing," feelings of eternal
  1021	youthfulness, and rapturous acceptance of others/events involve at
  1022	least a temporary activation of this circuit. Circuit Five control
  1023	techniques have been employed by yogic and Tantric practices, Zen,
  1024	ancient Greek psychedelic drug-assisted rituals at Eleusis,
  1025	Dionysians, Mithraic cults, Christian Scientists, Sufis,and
  1026	probably early Christianity as well.  Occasionally attempts to
  1027	activate Circuit Five will result in a temporary, although
  1028	disconcerting, period known as the "Dark Night of the Soul" or
  1029	"crossing the Abyss," characterized by painful ordinary physical
  1030	sensations, generalized bodily discomfort, distorted, nightmarish
  1031	perceptions, anxiety, and an aversion to or fear of light.
  1032	However difficult such a state may become, it does pass eventually
  1033	into the ecstatic bliss of positive Circuit Five experience.
  1034	
  1035	   The fifth circuit, centered largely in the right cortex,
  1036	"thinks in Gestalts" -- that is, fifth-circuit processes are not
  1037	linear progressions but holistic, simultaneous perceptions.
  1038	Neurologically wired to the genitals and the limbic system
  1039	(associated with the first circuit) and often working through
  1040	endorphins, the circuit is often triggered by relaxed, playful
  1041	sex.  One who has activated and imprinted this circuit is radiant,
  1042	cheerful rather than depressed, energetic rather than sluggish, in
  1043	exceptional health, and almost seems to "sparkle."  The various
  1044	complaints of the lower circuits --first-circuit physical
  1045	sickness, second-circuit aggressive power-over, submissive
  1046	no-power, and the associated turbulent emotions, third-circuit
  1047	bewilderment over how to improve the quality of life, and
  1048	fourth-circuit guilt -- are resolved quickly and dramatically by
  1049	the advent of fifth-circuit consciousness.  An accurate
  1050	description of life by fifth-circuit adepts is "floating one foot
  1051	off the ground."
  1052	
  1053	Circuit Five Application
  1054	
  1055	   It seems to me that one of the most effective ways to integrate
  1056	Circuit Five experience into daily life is to work on focusing the
  1057	consciousness intensely in space-time.  Being "here-now"
  1058	transforms even the most mundane tasks into a set of hedonic
  1059	sensations and virtually wipes out boredom from the working
  1060	vocabulary.  Paul Reps relates such an ancient tale in his Zen
  1061	Flesh, Zen Bones:
  1062	
  1063	     Zen students are with their masters at least ten years before
  1064	     they presume to teach others.  Nan-in was visited by Tenno,
  1065	     who, having passed his apprenticeship, had become a teacher.
  1066	     The day happened to be rainy, so Tenno wore wooden clogs and
  1067	     carried an umbrella.  After greeting him Nan-in remarked:
  1068	
  1069	     "I suppose you left your wooden clogs in the vestibule.  I
  1070	     want to know if your umbrella is on the right or left side of
  1071	     the clogs." Tenno, confused, had no instant answer.  He
  1072	     realized that he was unable to carry his Zen every minute.
  1073	     He became Nan- in's pupil, and he studied six more years to
  1074	     accomplish his every-minute Zen.
  1075	
  1076	   When this Circuit Five "every-minute Zen" is achieved, one
  1077	can't help remembering where the umbrella is!  At the moment that
  1078	he placed the umbrella, Tenno would have been so absorbed in the
  1079	interplay of colors and shapes between the umbrella, clogs, and
  1080	the decor of the vestibule, for instance, that those sensory
  1081	images would have been vividly stamped in his mind and readily
  1082	accessible to memory.  In this state, the environment becomes a
  1083	whirling miasma of such vivid sense data that just walking down
  1084	the sidewalk becomes a "retinal circus": the texture of the
  1085	sidewalk is a profound sculpture of perfect randomness; the sprays
  1086	of grass coming up through the cracks are delightful explosions of
  1087	soft green against the tan concrete; wildflowers along the sides
  1088	smear their luscious pastels across the visual field, seeming to
  1089	blossom into the brain itself; trees a few feet away leap into the
  1090	mind with every gully and protrusion in the bark relieved in vast
  1091	detail; the blocks in the sidewalk seem crazily tilted and
  1092	hilariously three-dimensional; the sudden whooshing of a sprinkler
  1093	in the adjacent yard seems a delicately balanced symphony of
  1094	sound; the sky is impossibly blue against the wispy clouds -- the
  1095	whole body tingles and lightens, seeming about to lift off the
  1096	ground and fly!  Needless to say, life becomes a fluid, hedonic
  1097	experience in which boredom is unheard of.
  1098	
  1099	   But what about when your bank screws you over, your camping
  1100	trip gets rained out, your car throws a rod, and your best friend
  1101	announces she is no longer speaking to you?  No amount of cursing
  1102	the local deities and trying to force things into your elegantly
  1103	prepared scheme will do a bit of good.  With that approach, you
  1104	stomp around the house muttering all day until you've muttered
  1105	yourself blue in the face.  At such times the most expedient thing
  1106	to do is to stop in your tracks, screw your eyes tight shut
  1107	(assuming you're not driving), jump up and down, screaming madly a
  1108	few times, then do some deep breathing until you feel relatively
  1109	stable.  Hopefully, during the course of the breathing your face
  1110	(and other muscles) will have relaxed somewhat.  Now, you can open
  1111	your eyes to a calmer world and proceed to plan your next step.
  1112	
  1113	   First priority must be relieving any physical pain you may be
  1114	in, if the means are at hand, so that you can think more clearly.
  1115	Slow down, tense and relax all of your muscles in turn; breathe
  1116	deeply and slowly, filling your lungs and expanding your abdomen
  1117	with air; hold for a few moments, then release, still slowly,
  1118	pausing with all of the air released before inhaling again.
  1119	Meanwhile, slowly tell yourself "Calm, calm, calm," lingering on
  1120	each sound within the word as you breathe.  Now, take stock of
  1121	your situation. Exactly what has changed, and what are the
  1122	immediate implications for you? Never mind futuring; many possible
  1123	complications may never develop.  Accept complete responsibility
  1124	for your perceptions!  The importance of the last sentence cannot
  1125	be emphasized enough.  Through experience I have found that
  1126	usually a problem isn't a problem unless you perceive it as one.
  1127	If all else fails, a simple shrug and a decision to go with the
  1128	flow, to do whatever is necessary and try to learn from the
  1129	situation, seems to be the best approach. Struggling against the
  1130	reality bumping you in the nose accomplishes nothing and is
  1131	extremely frustrating, to say the least.
  1132	
  1133	        As Lao Tsu said,
  1134	        It is not wise to rush about....
  1135	        If too much energy is used, exhaustion follows.
  1136	                 ....
  1137	        The world is ruled by letting things take their course.
  1138	        It cannot be ruled by interfering.
  1139	                      --Tao Te Ching
  1140	
  1141	Finally, yet another hint from a Zen parable:
  1142	
  1143	Buddha told a man in a sutra:
  1144	
  1145	     A man traveling across a field encountered a tiger. He fled,
  1146	     the tiger after him.  Coming to a precipice, he caught hold
  1147	     of the root of a wild vine and swung himself down over the
  1148	     edge.  The tiger sniffed at him from above.  Trembling, the
  1149	     man looked down to where, far below, another tiger was
  1150	     waiting to eat him. Only the vine sustained him.
  1151	
  1152	     Two mice, one white and one black, little by little started
  1153	     gnaw away the vine.  The man saw a luscious strawberry near
  1154	     him.  Grasping the vine with one hand, he plucked the
  1155	     strawberry with the other.  How sweet it tasted!
  1156	
  1157	Circuit Six: The Collective Neurogenetic Circuit
  1158	
  1159	   Circuit Six is operating when the information archived in our
  1160	DNA becomes consciously accessible in the waking state.  The RNA-
  1161	DNA "dialogue" begins broadcasting messages to the central nervous
  1162	system from within each neuron. Descriptions of experiences of
  1163	this circuit typically include "past-life memories,"
  1164	reincarnational themes, concepts of immortality, the idea of
  1165	akashic records, or a realization of something like the Gaia
  1166	hypothesis, which views our entire planet as a conscious organism,
  1167	with all life upon it inextricably linked.  The music of Beethoven
  1168	paints quite an accurate picture of this realization; large doses
  1169	of LSD inevitably trigger a temporary similar awareness.
  1170	Gurdjieff called this circuit the True Emotional Center.
  1171	
  1172	   Various cultures have given different names to sixth-circuit
  1173	states throughout the ages -- Hindu "Atman consciousness," Greek
  1174	"vision of Pan," Chinese idea of the Tao, etc.  When Circuit Six
  1175	is initially activated, personified archetypes usually arrive in
  1176	the personal philosophy, interpreted as "Gods," "Goddesses,"
  1177	and/or "Demons." Jung's theory of archetypes from the collective
  1178	unconscious describes this phenomenon well.  These archetypes
  1179	commonly appear in the world of dreams; they become more immediate
  1180	still when Circuit Six is flipped on, often humanizing the circuit
  1181	as an image of the "Higher Self" such as the cosmic Fool, the Holy
  1182	Guardian Angel, dwarves, the Green Man, etc.  If the circuit
  1183	remains activated, the perceptions usually move into more direct
  1184	visions of a consciously evolving, unfolding evolutionary scheme
  1185	of increasing self-awareness, including awareness of the entire
  1186	Gaia biosphere, past developments and future possibilities alike.
  1187	Death is no longer to be feared, since not a single life but a
  1188	continuous framework of lives and deaths becomes the operating
  1189	reality.
  1190	
  1191	   Circuit Six processes, probably operating from the right neo-
  1192	cortex, use the many-layered language of endless associations and
  1193	connotations conjured up by each concept -- language similar to
  1194	that used by James Joyce in his Finnegans Wake.  When a plethora
  1195	of synchronicities emerges in daily life, the sixth circuit is
  1196	definitely alive and well, mirroring this language of simultaneous
  1197	concepts in everyday events.
  1198	
  1199	   The basic experience of Circuit Six is communion or
  1200	conversation with the ancient genetic "architect" behind all
  1201	physical organisms.  Whether personified as a divinely intoxicated
  1202	male or female archetype or defined as an impersonal, amorphous
  1203	force, the realization is that of a vast life force becoming
  1204	increasingly self-aware and exploring the infinite possibilities
  1205	that lie ahead.
  1206	
  1207	Circuit Six Application
  1208	
  1209	   Enmeshing Circuit Six consciousness into your everyday format
  1210	can be quite an adventure!  First of all, we'll consider working
  1211	with the genetic archetypes.  The most useful application of these
  1212	archetypes, in an everyday sort of way, seems to be the practice
  1213	of "aspecting" or "drawing down," "invoking a god(dess)-form,"
  1214	etc.  Let's say you're on your way to deliver a particularly
  1215	complex presentation, and you're understandably jittery.  Take a
  1216	minute or two to select an appropriate archetype or assemble your
  1217	own from the genetic archives, then construct a brief, empowering
  1218	fantasy in which you, as the archetype, demonstrate your
  1219	eloquence, your balance, your unruffled assurance, or whatever
  1220	else it is you need for this particular occasion.
  1221	
  1222	   In this instance, you might select Connor MacLeod from the
  1223	movie Highlander to impress dynamic, determined poise and
  1224	confidence - - for the next few minutes, you might feel the
  1225	ancient sword in your hands like the touch of an old friend, feel
  1226	the power and excitement of the Quickening--feel the relaxed
  1227	alertness as you circle your foe, feel the empty space at the
  1228	center of the peace as you act effortlessly and fluidly, every
  1229	nerve tingling to the same pulse--feel the
  1230	quantum-leap-spiralling-upwards zoom as the power of
  1231	self-actualization explodes into you -- as you claim the Prize.
  1232	(Fade to black....)  Now you speed on winged boots through memory
  1233	circuitry, tangled neural gardens, finding the best words, the
  1234	most effective gestures, just the right degree of enthusiasm to
  1235	come out shining....  Now you play the Concertmaster, bringing in
  1236	each element of a magnificent dawn just at the right time with the
  1237	perfect dance of your baton, while the sky lightens, animals stir,
  1238	buds open and the surface looks up in unison as the sun appears
  1239	over the horizon....  I bet you're a lot less jittery now.  Good
  1240	luck!
  1241	
  1242	   In addition to archetypal fantasy, Circuit Six has other
  1243	advantageous uses--namely, peeping at the genetic blueprints for
  1244	"future" possibilities. At the very least, such excursions will
  1245	expand your perspective and serve to remind you that nothing is
  1246	static--that we are not at the end of an evolutionary trend but
  1247	are constantly designing new pathways into the "future."  After
  1248	contemplating some of the eye-opening realities we can look
  1249	forward to cultivating, it's often a lot easier to appreciate our
  1250	current position in the Universing of our choice.
  1251	
  1252	Circuit Seven: The Metaprogramming Circuit
  1253	
  1254	   The Metaprogramming Circuit is activated when the brain becomes
  1255	aware of itself as engineer of experience.  When you think of your
  1256	mind as mind, then think of the mind that contemplates that mind
  1257	as mind, then think of the mind that thinks of the mind
  1258	contemplating mind as mind, you have discovered the path to
  1259	metaprogramming consciousness.  Most methods of "enlightenment"
  1260	function by leading the student around and around in circles until
  1261	he is struck by the realization that he is himself responsible for
  1262	everything he experiences.  With the aid of this circuit, one
  1263	becomes self-programmer, then programs the self-programming, then
  1264	programs the programming of the self-programming, etc.--cybernetic
  1265	consciousness has been attained. Suddenly one is struck by the
  1266	humorous, completely relative nature of all third-circuit reality
  1267	maps; rigid, dogmatic systems claiming to have the only "One True
  1268	Way" become cosmic jokes to be laughed at heartily.  The Grand
  1269	Game becomes visible all at once; creating your own rules,
  1270	changing them at will, even manufacturing different gameboards for
  1271	entertainment and edification is what Circuit Seven is all about.
  1272	
  1273	   Apparently operating from the frontal lobes, the
  1274	metaprogramming circuit has been called the Gnostic "soul," the
  1275	Chinese "no-mind" (wu-hsin), the Tibetan Buddhist White Light of
  1276	the Void, the Hindu Shiva-darshana, Gurdjieff's True Intellectual
  1277	Center.  When you ultimately realize that the "self" is not
  1278	constant but constantly shifting and that the "soul" (Circuit
  1279	Seven) has no form precisely because it dons all forms and sheds
  1280	them at will, playing every role conceivable--you find you have
  1281	entered a Strange Loop no less perplexing, dramatic, and funny as
  1282	a Zen koan.  All that remains to be done is to constantly figure
  1283	out new ways to create reality- maps that are even funnier,
  1284	sexier, more inclusive, more delightful, and more entertaining
  1285	than the ones you were using yesterday!
  1286	
  1287	Circuit Seven Application
  1288	
  1289	   There doesn't seem to be a whole lot one can say about applying
  1290	Circuit Seven day-to-day, due to the nature of the circuit itself;
  1291	the application in this case is discovering and remembering that
  1292	as you watch Universe Universing itself, you are seeing your own
  1293	circuitry in action.  Once realized, this discovery frees you to
  1294	adopt any metaphors you wish or none at all, to drop them at will,
  1295	to pick useful elements from each reality-map and to discard non-
  1296	functional ones immediately.  The possibilities from this point
  1297	are endless.  With the staggering realization of total self-
  1298	responsibility and self-determination comes the creative tension
  1299	needed to construct, edit, and destroy new worldviews for fun and
  1300	profit.  There is much to be learned by dispensing with reality-
  1301	maps entirely, if only for limited periods of time.  As Lao Tsu
  1302	knew,
  1303	
  1304	     In the pursuit of learning, every day something is acquired.
  1305	     In the pursuit  of Tao, every day something is dropped.
  1306	
  1307	And, from the Zen tradition:
  1308	     Nan-in, a Japanese master during the Meiji era, received a
  1309	     university professor who came to inquire about Zen.
  1310	
  1311	     Nan-in served tea.  He poured his visitor's cup
  1312	     full, and then kept on pouring.
  1313	
  1314	     The professor watched the overflow until he no
  1315	     longer could restrain himself.  "It is overfull.
  1316	     No more will go in!"
  1317	
  1318	     "Like this cup," Nan-in said, "you are full of
  1319	     your own opinions and speculations.  How can I
  1320	     show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?"
  1321	                       -- Zen Flesh, Zen Bones
  1322	
  1323	   Such a refresher course in objectivity can, of course, be quite
  1324	startling -- if there is one thing that can be reliably expected
  1325	from experimentation with this circuit, it is the element of
  1326	surprise.  Situational ethics, relativity, and agnosticism are
  1327	useful tools indeed; the CyberNaut makes good use of them.
  1328	
  1329	Circuit Eight: The Non-Local Quantum Circuit
  1330	
  1331	   Also called the Metaphysiological Circuit, this type of
  1332	consciousness involves recognizing the model as a model and
  1333	proceeding to escape the model itself.  For instance, the circuits
  1334	we have been discussing theoretically are based in the brain;
  1335	however, in out-of-body experiences (OOBE's), consciousness
  1336	appears to escape the confines of the nervous system completely
  1337	and operate independently of it.  The OOBE -- sometimes triggered
  1338	by very large doses of LSD or ketamine, various yogic practices,
  1339	shamanic techniques, and sometimes occuring spontaneously -- is
  1340	one of many liberation-of-consciousness phenomena which point
  1341	ultimately to the type of experience variously known as union with
  1342	all consciousness, communion with the Cosmic Mind, Oneness with
  1343	God, etc.
  1344	
  1345	   Circuit Eight experience may best be explained by Bell's
  1346	Theorem, which demonstrates the impossibility of isolated systems
  1347	in a universe where each and every particle is constantly in
  1348	"instantaneous" communication with every other. "The Whole System
  1349	is a Whole System," in other words.  However, Special Relativity
  1350	says that energy cannot travel faster than light, so what medium
  1351	carries this "instantaneous" communication?  Dr. Edward Harris
  1352	Walker says it is "consciousness"; Dr. Jack Sarfatti states that
  1353	it is "information" and explains his theory with the following
  1354	metaphor: If the whole universe can be likened to a mega-computer,
  1355	then the sub-quantum realm is composed of mini-mini-computers.
  1356	The hardware of each computer (universe, individual brain,
  1357	sub-quantum mechanisms, etc.) is local in space and time.
  1358	However, the software is non-local, both spatially and temporally.
  1359	Since information is not energy but is what orders energy, there
  1360	is no conflict with Special Relativity.
  1361	
  1362	   In any case, encounters of the Ultimate kind seem practically
  1363	beyond description.  Words appear completely inadequate; in
  1364	Wilson's opinion, perhaps Beethoven said it best of all in the
  1365	fourth movement to his Ninth Symphony.
  1366	
  1367	
  1368	Circuit Eight Application
  1369	
  1370	   Language typically proves inadequate for describing non-local
  1371	phenomena, but there are some helpful methods of viewing Universe
  1372	through a non-local perspective.  One most rewarding technique is
  1373	focusing first on one's own heartbeat, then expanding the focus to
  1374	include a similar heart or pulse beating in unison within every
  1375	human heart, every animal heart, then merging with the pulsings of
  1376	plant life, and so on down to the slow, thunderous pulse of the
  1377	earth itself and out as far into the cosmos as imaginable, linking
  1378	with other planets, stars, quasars, etc.  The scope of the
  1379	imagination is the only limiting factor.  This exercise, performed
  1380	often and vividly, is a great way to feel connectedness with
  1381	Universe.  Empathy seems to be a vital key to opening up Circuit
  1382	Eight; therefore, exercises involving perceiving events/emotions
  1383	simultaneously from the vantage points of several different people
  1384	at once are highly useful. As links are forged more readily
  1385	between people who share an intimate bond, reverent sex is an
  1386	excellent opportunity for expanding the awareness to include
  1387	multiple sensations.
  1388	
  1389	   Since Circuit Eight is non-local in time as well as in space,
  1390	such time-bridging abilities as precognition and retrocognition
  1391	come into play.  Often, precognition is a matter of trusting your
  1392	own perceptions more than anything else, rather than dismissing
  1393	them as "only" imagination or fantasy.  Indeed, neither the future
  1394	nor the past can be described as fixed, since each person's
  1395	reality differs so widely, and many possibilities in the running
  1396	may or may not materialize at any given point.  With activation of
  1397	this circuit, comes the increasing awareness that various
  1398	realities are more or less arbitrary and equally valid depending
  1399	on the framework being used, a logical progression from the
  1400	metaprogramming discoveries of Circuit Seven.  Finally, the most
  1401	obvious indicator of Circuit Eight in operation is an expansive,
  1402	"cosmic" feeling that defies description but feels utterly
  1403	marvelous.
  1404	
  1405	Conclusion
  1406	
  1407	   The CyberNaut's goal must be to permanently activate and
  1408	incorporate each of the upper four circuits into everyday life.
  1409	These expanded modes of consciousness can and should work with the
  1410	realization of interconnectedness and relativity of all
  1411	mindschemes to produce a greater satisfaction with life and a
  1412	greater sense of humor towards the playing of The Game.  Once
  1413	these circuits are in healthy operation, every moment becomes a
  1414	dizzying spiral of intoxication with life and a creative endeavor
  1415	to conjure even more fun from the ever-unfolding processes at
  1416	work.
  1417	
  1418	
  1419	                    CYBERCRAFT RELATIONSHIPS
  1420	                         OF THE CIRCUITS
  1421	
  1422	   Earth Mother--Matrix
  1423	
  1424	   The Matrix is a different order of entity. Matrix is the
  1425	planet, the planetary ecosystem; the primordial Earth Mother.
  1426	Mostly the Matrix is the grid of space in which all life lives.
  1427	Should an anthropomorphic term be needed it should be called
  1428	Grandmother.
  1429	
  1430	   Sky Father--Patrus
  1431	
  1432	   Although not previously mentioned a primordial father figure in
  1433	the same order as Matrix exits. This entity is the Patrus, the Sky
  1434	Father and represents the external forces effecting the Matrix.
  1435	Additionally the Sky Father may be considered the original Star-
  1436	Sky seed bearer. He may represent evolution, changes in weather,
  1437	space alien intrusions, extra-terrestrial biological experiments
  1438	and or accidental transmissions of life from meteors or comets.
  1439	Call him Grandfather.
  1440	
  1441	     Lady
  1442	
  1443	     The Lady is the divine archetypal neuro-genetic pattern of
  1444	all human women. She is the best that all women can ever hope to
  1445	be plus a little more. The authors will not name her. She is yours
  1446	to name and venerate.
  1447	
  1448	     Lord
  1449	
  1450	     The Lord is the divine archetypal neuro-genetic pattern of
  1451	all human men. He is the best that all men can hope for plus a
  1452	little added on the side to keep us guessing his next move. He
  1453	remains nameless as does the Lady.
  1454	
  1455	   Domain Relationships
  1456	
  1457	   Domain interests can and will occur in all circuits from all
  1458	domains. Each circuit has a high, mid and low domain focus.
  1459	However some circuits may be more suited to a particular domain.
  1460	
  1461	   Circuit Tasking
  1462	
  1463	   Again the task of the CyberNaut is to accelerate and decelerate
  1464	all circuits to provide optimal usage and operation of each
  1465	circuit toward personally chosen ethical ends.
  1466	
  1467	
  1468	
  1469	
  1470	                   Lower Circuit Relationships
  1471	
  1472	   Circuit One Relationships
  1473	
  1474	   Circuit one is the Goddess circuit. The Goddess is not to be
  1475	confused with the Matrix.
  1476	
  1477	   All the circuits can be moved to or from any other circuits.
  1478	This circuit can be moved to when personal physical needs arise.
  1479	Circuit One is an area of knowledge that relates to bodily
  1480	concerns and needs. Other circuits may be associated with Circuit
  1481	One. Most importantly for CyberNauts would be the combination of
  1482	circuits One, Six and Seven. In this mode of operation the
  1483	CyberNaut would be engaged in metaprogramming towards a happier,
  1484	healthier relationship with the Goddess. Additionally Circuit
  1485	Eight may be added in when involved in mid domain Craft efforts.
  1486	
  1487	   Acceleration of Circuit One includes all knowledge bases that
  1488	help the physical organism survive. This is a "do" circuit more
  1489	than a "know" circuit. Physical health and hygiene are integral to
  1490	this circuit as well as personal defense measures. Life extension
  1491	efforts originate in the high domain here.
  1492	
  1493	   Circuit Two Relationships
  1494	
  1495	   Circuit Two is the God circuit. Circuit Two is not to be
  1496	confused with the Patrus. This circuit represents all human
  1497	authority structures. By using circuits Two, Three, Six and Seven
  1498	CyberNauts can gain healing and instruction with respect to
  1499	social, familial and political authority structures.
  1500	
  1501	   Again this is a do circuit more than a know circuit.
  1502	Acceleration can be achieved by learning successful teamwork,
  1503	corporate and political structures. This circuit needs much
  1504	healing as most CyberNauts have an awful taste in their mouths
  1505	concerning authority structures and God in particular. Many an
  1506	individual fears not only external authority but their own
  1507	internal authority.  Rituals should be written to enhance the
  1508	CyberCraft images of power within. We can and will trust ourselves
  1509	amidst all the chaos and confusion of a society run wild. Whereas
  1510	Circuit One is related to the body and emotions Circuit Two is
  1511	focused toward emotions and external relationships.
  1512	
  1513	   Circuit Three Relationships
  1514	
  1515	   Circuit Three is the Semantic Time Binding Circuit. It should
  1516	be associated with the Divine Son. In Wiccan thealogical
  1517	structures a Goddess and God exists. However nothing is said of
  1518	their progeny; a divine son and daughter. Most Wiccans know of the
  1519	Three Faced Goddess. Little know of the Three Faced God. According
  1520	to the neurogenetic teachings of CyberCraft the Three Faced God is
  1521	composed of Bright Youth, the Mad Prophet and the Wise Elder. See
  1522	R. J. Stewart's nicely written material on the Merlin Conferences
  1523	for more information.
  1524	
  1525	   This circuit represents the fiery nature of flowing information
  1526	and ideologies. It relates more to ideas and ideologies than
  1527	emotions. Fierce ideological fighting of both an external and
  1528	internal nature is indicative of this experience. Such shows the
  1529	immature nature of the circuit. Its mature aspects would be
  1530	manifest in the free and tolerant exchange of ideas and
  1531	technologies. Hidden, deceitful, false and inflexible
  1532	communications are abhorrent to the mature aspects of Circuit
  1533	Three. However such deceitful communications are pointers to its
  1534	immature nature.
  1535	
  1536	   Circuit Three should be combined with circuits Five and Seven
  1537	to create more humane and beneficial systems of communicating
  1538	ideas and technologies. Circuit Three has great promise when it
  1539	manifests itself in mature form. It should also be mated with
  1540	Circuit Eight to start processing new research into non-local
  1541	discarnate communications and information networks.
  1542	
  1543	   This is a know circuit which realizes the innate value of
  1544	knowing. Rituals need to be written to acknowledge and venerate
  1545	the Divine Son. At some point Circuit Three needs to be mated with
  1546	Circuit Four to produce the next series of circuits. Circuit Three
  1547	can be accelerated by exposure to new, different and seemingly
  1548	conflicting ideologies in a non-Aristotelian environment.
  1549	
  1550	   Circuit Four Relationships
  1551	
  1552	   Circuit Four is the Social-Sexual Circuit. It should be
  1553	associated with the Divine Daughter. In previous chapters it has
  1554	been called the guilt circuit. Typically guilt and shame have been
  1555	used to control the activities of women of all ages. In it's
  1556	immature aspects this circuit is heavily polarized being either
  1557	promiscuous or fearfully abstinent. A balance based upon knowledge
  1558	should be strived for. In essence this circuit is the doorway into
  1559	Circuit Five.
  1560	
  1561	   Circuit Four should be used with circuits Five, Six and Seven
  1562	to produce newer personal mythos replete with viable mythopoetic
  1563	structures ready to serve WoMankind.
  1564	
  1565	   Immature Circuit Four struggles indicate an unwillingness to
  1566	integrate ones nature within the Matrix. It suffers from guilt
  1567	tripping in Circuit Two. And is confused by the holistic
  1568	information in a mature Circuit Three. Circuit Five exists to
  1569	liberate Circuit Four but present conditions in American society
  1570	lend poorly to complete liberation.
  1571	
  1572	   Circuit Four can be accelerated by getting in touch with our
  1573	own emotions and bodies. Rituals should be written to liberate
  1574	Circuit Four for more integrated emotions and sexuality. Guilt and
  1575	shame must be jettisoned to make room for healthy, holistic
  1576	emotional and sexual lives. Circuits Three and Four compliment
  1577	each other. Some rituals are needed to integrate the airy and
  1578	sexual.
  1579	
  1580	          Switching Gears into the Programming Circuits
  1581	
  1582	   Circuit Five Relationships
  1583	
  1584	   Circuit Five is the Holistic Neurosomatic circuit. Circuit Five
  1585	conflicts arise over what it takes for the individual to feel
  1586	good.  This circuit is the first attempt at taking control of ones
  1587	own life. Knowledge based upon the holistic integration of the
  1588	previous circuits enable the CyberNaut to proceed smoothly through
  1589	times of personal and social stress. All lower and upper circuits
  1590	can be processed with this circuit. If it's not fun why do it?
  1591	Circuit Five is the springboard into the other upper circuits. And
  1592	through Circuit Five we can take that long first step toward
  1593	understanding and achieving our short and long term goals.
  1594	
  1595	   Rituals should be written that include Circuit Five inflections
  1596	for all other circuits.
  1597	
  1598	   Circuit Five is the most important of the upper circuits for
  1599	the novice CyberNaut. Antero Alli refers to Circuit Five as Chapel
  1600	Perilous. When the novice first ventures through the previous
  1601	Circuits they form stable relationships between themselves and
  1602	their world. However Circuit Five has the tendency to change
  1603	previous programming. This Circuit upsets the apple cart. A
  1604	seemingly instantaneous realization occurs that things aren't what
  1605	they really seem to be. Now everything is in doubt. Nothing is
  1606	sure. Only the brave and mature should venture into Chapel
  1607	Perilous. But as can readily be seen, life seems to propel us into
  1608	Circuit Five whether we are ready or not.
  1609	
  1610	   Circuit Six Relationships
  1611	
  1612	   Circuit Six is the Collective Neurogenetic Circuit. By way of
  1613	Circuit Six we can begin writing and integrating personal
  1614	mythologies concerning what we are and where we want to go. This
  1615	circuit allows us to explore the hidden spaces of our aspirations
  1616	while hinting at intelligent, ethical control of our psychic-
  1617	selves. This circuit should be combined with all other circuits in
  1618	ways that allow deep penetration of personally chosen data into
  1619	human psyches. Circuit Six will apply mostly to the mid and low
  1620	domain.
  1621	
  1622	   Priestesses we know tell us of the emotional and energetic
  1623	charge they receive when performing the Charge of the Goddess. In
  1624	Drawing Down the Moon Circuit Six is in full operation. Through
  1625	the Charge of the Goddess this Circuit offers a neurogenetic link
  1626	to Circuit One. In doing this we gain a mythopoetic view at our
  1627	pasts and futures.
  1628	
  1629	   For men we have a ritual called Drawing Down the Sun. Circuit
  1630	Six offers men access to neurogenetic links which offer the same
  1631	insights but from the God's aspect of Circuit One.
  1632	
  1633	   Circuit Seven Relationships
  1634	
  1635	   Circuit Seven is the Metaprogramming Circuit. This is the
  1636	second most important circuit for the novice CyberNaut. In Circuit
  1637	Seven operations the CyberNaut can and will discover, analyze and
  1638	repair all previous circuit disfunctionalities. As with Circuit
  1639	Five it should be associated with all other circuits. This circuit
  1640	is critical when accelerating and decelerating circuits.
  1641	
  1642	   Circuit Eight Relationships
  1643	
  1644	   Circuit Eight is the Metaphysiological or Non-Local Quantum
  1645	Circuit. Here circuit tasking is a little different. The goal of
  1646	Circuit Eight activities is to escape the model itself, freeing
  1647	the entity to experience as clearly as possible non-local
  1648	existence. Typically Eight is used with all circuits to step
  1649	outside the framework for new perspectives.
  1650	
  1651	   Circuit Eight is the walk way to higher states of being. As
  1652	life extension and personal research enable new personal and
  1653	common vistas this circuit becomes more important.
  1654	
  1655	                   External and Internal Faces
  1656	
  1657	   All the Circuits involve open and hidden aspects. But what is a
  1658	hidden aspect? The hidden aspects are modes or techniques which
  1659	may be viewed as extremely negative by our culture. CyberCraft is
  1660	a continuation of knowledge which was not received well by our
  1661	contemporaries. Consequently any practice which may bring
  1662	prosecution or unusual persecution should be considered an
  1663	internal aspect. This is to protect the CyberCraft.
  1664	
  1665	   As examples--followers of Lyndan Larouche have already
  1666	penetrated certain neoPagan and Magickal computer networks, gained
  1667	information and published pamphlets publicly branding the
  1668	networkers as Satanic devil worshipers utilizing a nationwide
  1669	Satanic computer network designed to help facilitate the stealing
  1670	of innocent children from the Christian enclaves. Is it presently
  1671	rumored that some reportedly armed right-wing organizations are
  1672	collecting names and addresses for their databases. The South
  1673	Western Radio Church has long been on an anti-newage campaign and
  1674	can't be far behind. Some federal agencies have penetrated
  1675	networks of pedophiles and gathered names of suspects from the
  1676	owners and users of the network.
  1677	
  1678	   Under no circumstance is a public access computer network to be
  1679	considered secure. Use encryption programs that are DES based to
  1680	provide the needed security. Pass the keys by first class mail.
  1681	Code the keys in questions or stories that only CyberNauts would
  1682	understand.
  1683	
  1684	   The external face can be discussed freely in public
  1685	environments. The hidden face should be discussed only between
  1686	members or between members and trusted inquirers. And then only
  1687	the knowledge needed should be exposed.
  1688	
  1689	   For the internal faces written and electronic telephone line or
  1690	air radiated communications should be encrypted in such a way as
  1691	to provide a reasonable measure of security. Leave no unencrypted
  1692	internal face material open to accidental discovery by children or
  1693	neighbors.
  1694	
  1695	   This author's experience with government agencies is that some
  1696	1700 governmental agencies keep and maintain information on
  1697	individuals. Once these agencies acquire negative information much
  1698	time, money and effort is required to purge their records. Even
  1699	then one is never sure an agency has not simply refilled the
  1700	information in different areas to retain the disputed information.
  1701	
  1702	   Privacy is a vital practice. This may seem paranoid but a
  1703	general practice of privacy can only benefit us.
  1704	
  1705	
  1706	                 Sharing Bio-circuit Experiences
  1707	
  1708	     Bio-Circuit 5 Experiences
  1709	
  1710	     I have had some very wonderful experiences with the upper 4
  1711	circuits. Some of this may sound threatening but I hope not too
  1712	much.
  1713	
  1714	     Between circuits 4 and 5 is a place I call Darkmoor. Antero
  1715	Alli terms it Chapel Perilous. (I'll see if I have info. on
  1716	Darkmoor on the E-Net.) Darkmoor is the region of doubt we
  1717	experience when we begin to notice the upper 4 circuits. Some,
  1718	perhaps most of us, start thinking that we are betraying our
  1719	parents, sometimes our peers, and perhaps ourselves when we modify
  1720	our lifestyles toward circuit 5. After all most of us were taught
  1721	from early on that we had to "work hard" to live. Circuit 5 lets
  1722	us know that we can enjoy ourselves, even be a little lazy when we
  1723	need, or when we want.
  1724	
  1725	     The upper circuits do somewhat parallel the lower circuits.
  1726	The bodily feel goodness of circuit 1 is paralleled and amplified
  1727	in circuit 5. For most people life can be good, for some it can be
  1728	great, yet others live fantastic lives. Generally when we learn
  1729	not to fight ourselves, our general need to feel good and be
  1730	happy, we learn to live well.
  1731	
  1732	     About a year ago I met the young wife of younger friend, who
  1733	through their own doings were coming to terms with an impending
  1734	divorce. In the months after we met she and I were synchronously
  1735	thrown into "things" together. We began to see and sleep with each
  1736	other during their separation. She moved in with me some months
  1737	before their divorce was final. Jim, her ex, has shown great
  1738	integrity throughout the process and now seems to have resolved
  1739	his concerns about the divorce. Both Jim and Alisandra made it
  1740	through their problems by using circuit 5, the holistic neuro-
  1741	somatic pleasure circuit. By indulging themselves in pleasure they
  1742	found that their previous relationship was pretty shaky from the
  1743	beginning. Since they both are fairly independent their new
  1744	lifestyles are much better than their old one.
  1745	
  1746	     For them, in their need, circuit 5 worked well. They had no
  1747	idea that circuit 5 existed. But they naturally used the processes
  1748	of this circuit to help them get through. Sure it was tough, but
  1749	not nearly as tough as others.
  1750	
  1751	     Alisandra is 14 years my junior. I tend to "worship" youth
  1752	and beauty. So I surround myself with people I think of as
  1753	youthful and beautiful. In my social intercourse my friends and I
  1754	deal with people our age down to college students. Since I have no
  1755	surviving family and Alisandra's fundamentalist parents in
  1756	Tennessee think she is "possessed by the Devil" (by me??) neither
  1757	of us have older, cranky parents to deal with.
  1758	
  1759	     Currently for us circuit 5 is the main circuit. We take our
  1760	pleasure any-when and where we desire. And with anyone we desire.
  1761	Sure we have our little spats but we both know the rules of
  1762	communication. We deal with the little stuff before it pile up.
  1763	She knows about my minor blood sugar problem so we don't get into
  1764	arguments when my body decides to do something different. (I've
  1765	been told by lovers "You're cranky in the morning." Isn't
  1766	everybody??
  1767	
  1768	     Sometimes I wonder how the grasshopper felt. Did he really
  1769	think that winter wouldn't come?? If we take our pleasure
  1770	constantly will we miss some other important event? Yes. Tim Leary
  1771	writes that people _stuck_ in circuit 5 think having fun is too
  1772	important to be weighed down with commitments and progress. Those
  1773	stuck in circuit 5 find it extremely difficult to even notice the
  1774	upper 3 circuits.
  1775	
  1776	     The general warning is that there is always something else to
  1777	learn, to experience. Till things go "non-local", "exponential"
  1778	and/or "non-linear" in circuit 8 we always have another circuit to
  1779	experience.
  1780	
  1781	     One other important point. Infact it's a large consideration.
  1782	Health, no not just sexual health, but health in general.
  1783	Exploring circuits takes time. Without a healthy body and mind the
  1784	fun of exploration is diminished, perhaps even precluded.
  1785	
  1786	     In this model life extension is a vital part. Writer Paul
  1787	Bragg, who influenced Jack Lalane, made it to 96 with all his
  1788	teeth and normal vision, running 5 miles a day and swimming a mile
  1789	on occasion. Alas due to an unfortunate accident Paul Bragg is no
  1790	longer with us.
  1791	
  1792	     There is no reason why we can't live to 100 or 150. Health is
  1793	part and parcel of circuit 5. What does it benefit us to be kings
  1794	and queens if our health is failing? Yet with good health of mind
  1795	and body even paupers have the opportunity to become wealthy. With
  1796	the emergence of micro- and nano-technology in 50 years or so, we
  1797	may have the tools to extend life to 2-3 hundred years. Some
  1798	visionaries tell us that because technology is exploding
  1799	exponentially, in the coming century we may find ways to extend
  1800	life indefinitely. Or perhaps until the individual decides it's
  1801	time to die. It'd be a shame to die the day before immortality
  1802	machines are brought online.
  1803	
  1804	     Along with life extension comes greater ability to cope with
  1805	change. In a 150 year life cycle comes the ability to cross train
  1806	in several different fields of study. Then after they have been
  1807	assimilated a cross-discplinary approach to the tough problems can
  1808	be used to better solve those problems.
  1809	
  1810	     Of course a 150 year lifecycle also means about 120 years of
  1811	pleasure in circuit 5. That's quite a consideration.
  1812	
  1813	
  1814	     Circuit 6 experiences
  1815	
  1816	     Circuit 6 experiences concern the Collective Neuro-genetic
  1817	Relationship
  1818	
  1819	     Alisandra and I have been involved with neo-paganism for a
  1820	few years. While neither of us believes in a real Goddess or God
  1821	we do see the value in this for some people. However what appeals
  1822	to us are collective neuro-genetic archetypes. Please read Jung's
  1823	work on archetypes for established and accepted definitions of
  1824	archetypes.
  1825	
  1826	     To us archetypes are patterns in both the conscious and
  1827	unconscious that "program" windows of action or opportunity for
  1828	us. Archetypes can be either the individual's genetic coding
  1829	(programming) or a culturally determined way or mode of
  1830	experiencing life.
  1831	
  1832	     Alisandra likes Connor MacLeod from Highlander. In this story
  1833	a young immortal must confront his immortality, ignorance and
  1834	conflict with other immortals for a fabulous prize. Here is the
  1835	powerful story of the mythical Hero's Journey. It is the story of
  1836	all human life. Expanding consciousness can be substituted for
  1837	immortality and the story is much the same. (And as presented in
  1838	the previous reply consciousness may indeed bring to us practical
  1839	immortality.)
  1840	
  1841	     Circuit 6 helps us get in touch with our past, present and
  1842	future history. Some folks think that the current state of
  1843	humanity is the culminating state. I think not. In a million years
  1844	or so we may find as many different types of humans as we find in
  1845	other different but similar species.
  1846	
  1847	     Part of circuit 6 is aspecting a neuro-genetic archetype.
  1848	Some folks call this channeling; and while they think they are
  1849	channeling a discarnate entity from elsewhere I have my
  1850	suspicions.  In my life I have noticed a semi-major personality
  1851	change about every 2-3 years. To me the current personality is a
  1852	variable composite of past personalities. It's variable in that it
  1853	is a changeable forum or quorum of memories, thoughts and feelings
  1854	that make up Mike. In this quorum there are stronger and weaker
  1855	individuals. Each play their own part in my psyche. If I allow a
  1856	change in the quorum these internal changes are evident to me and
  1857	close friends.
  1858	
  1859	     Aspecting (channeling) is changing the forum, rearranging the
  1860	quorum for a different perspective or view of reality. Modern
  1861	channelers then speak and act differently than normally. But we
  1862	don't need to be channelers to get in touch with the collective
  1863	neuro-genetic patterns.
  1864	
  1865	     I said I'd share. (But I didn't say I would lecture a bit
  1866	too.  Along with aspecting is something similar I term virtual
  1867	personalities. I have a virtual personality named Ammond. He lives
  1868	in a somewhat different world than Mike. But he has much the same
  1869	outlook.
  1870	
  1871	     Virtual personalities, sometimes called alter-egos, are
  1872	pretty much the same thing as a Fantasy Role Playing entity. Those
  1873	who have played Dungeons and Dragons are familiar with FRP games.
  1874	But what has gaming theory got to do with life? Almost everything.
  1875	Life has rules, regulations and consequences. Games have the
  1876	models of those very same things.
  1877	
  1878	     Tim Leary got into hot water with "games" in a time when life
  1879	was a serious matter. Early in Joseph Campbell's book PRIMITIVE
  1880	MYTHOLOGY Joe talks about different culture's approaches to life.
  1881	One approach is that life is a game to be played. I like that
  1882	approach myself. If we make ourselves perceive life as a game we
  1883	can have fun with the game. Sometimes we can even get away with
  1884	mucking with/the rules. Consequences are there though...
  1885	
  1886	     In Mike's life Ammond is part of the game of aspecting a
  1887	neuro-collective archetype we know of as witch or magician. Others
  1888	play this important game with him. Alisandra played for a while
  1889	too. Both of us got tired of that game so we have mucked the
  1890	rules, plotted a different course to the stars again. We are
  1891	starting in another direction. But the archetype(s) is deep within
  1892	our psyche.  We can no more escape them than we can escape our own
  1893	arms.
  1894	
  1895	     An advantage of being able to muck the rules is that we can
  1896	determine what we can and cannot get away with. American culture
  1897	is very restrictive. Getting in touch with the genetic archetypes
  1898	enable us to experiment, to know, to be flexible enough to shape-
  1899	shift into a new personality at whim. Our participants who are
  1900	actors can identify with this concept.
  1901	
  1902	     In current psychologies we have models including only three
  1903	entities--child, adult and parent. However these are a basic three
  1904	in many thousands. The collective neuro-genetic circuit gives us
  1905	the opportunity to emulate any of those thousands of internal,
  1906	genetically and culturally driven archetypes.
  1907	
  1908	     Just for fun, here are a few words from Ammond...
  1909	
  1910	     "The witch is a powerful person because they learn to turn,
  1911	bend, shape and condition reality. Life is a marvelous thing when
  1912	one realizes that magick does indeed work. Through magick I can
  1913	create, modify or condition anything in my life. That's fun and I
  1914	benefit greatly."
  1915	
  1916	     Thanx Ammond. And now a few words from another important
  1917	person-- Arthur C. Clarke... "Any sufficiently advanced technology
  1918	is indistinguishable from magic." Of which Ammond bends into "To
  1919	the culturally xenophobic any sufficiently different technology is
  1920	indistinguishable from magic, ie. pure garbage."
  1921	
  1922	
  1923	     Circuit 7 experiences...
  1924	
  1925	     What can be said about circuit 7? Lots of things, but these
  1926	statements are almost in a different language. Something not in
  1927	English. In its most basic aspect circuit 7 is the point in the
  1928	individual's development where they begin to understand how they
  1929	program, influence, and condition their own minds. The programmer
  1930	takes control of the program to design in or erase out those
  1931	functions useful or not. This includes feelings and emotions.
  1932	[Glasser's Perception orders give us a hint as to how to use
  1933	circuit 7 better.]
  1934	
  1935	     Circuit 7 is the metaprogramming circuit. Dr. Lilly has a lot
  1936	to say on this subject in some of his books. I think Center Of The
  1937	Cyclone and Programmimg And Metaprogramming The Human Biocomputer
  1938	both address this topic. I haven't read the latter at this point.
  1939	It's on my list of a hundred or so.
  1940	
  1941	     In other topics I refer to the human mind/body complex as a
  1942	single somewhat mechanical entity. Robert Anton Wilson says the
  1943	brain is something like a silicon computer. Cyber-punks term the
  1944	brain "wetware". They even go as far as to distinguish between
  1945	minds, ie. "meat mind" and "machine mind".
  1946	
  1947	     In K. Eric Drexler's Engines Of Creation--The Coming Era Of
  1948	Nanotechnology, he starts his book off writing of the machines
  1949	that inhabit the human body. Each human cell is inhabited with
  1950	millions of tiny nanomachines. And today we have the beginning of
  1951	the capability of sensing, viewing, controlling and creating
  1952	newer, more useful nanomachines. Obviously our understanding of
  1953	the word machine is evolving. (Perhaps you have heard recently
  1954	that folks at IBM labs have the ability to manipulate individual
  1955	atoms. In 22 hours with a scanning tunneling microscope they moved
  1956	32 xenon atoms across a nickel surface to spell out IBM. It was
  1957	difficult and slow, but it was done. Additionally genetic
  1958	researchers on the East Coast are asking for children with genetic
  1959	conditions to volunteer for genetic manipulation and testing. They
  1960	think they can "fix" the bad chromosones.)
  1961	
  1962	     The human body and by extension the human brain (wetware) is
  1963	composed of individual micro and nano machines. So by extension we
  1964	can think of the human brain as a macro-machine (in light of the
  1965	littler machines that make its composition.) As time proceeds,
  1966	technology and human knowledge progress. Even the understanding of
  1967	"technology" and "knowledge" changes with new information. The
  1968	understanding of "human" and "mind" changes even as you read this
  1969	reply.
  1970	
  1971	     Today we are on the verge of a radical change. Additionally,
  1972	radical changes in our paradigms are happening now. Either our
  1973	individual worldviews keep up with existing useful knowledge or we
  1974	will grow "strange", alienating ourselves from the force of the
  1975	march of the race toward the stars.
  1976	
  1977	     One of these paradigm changes is one which considers the
  1978	human animal more machine and less a metaphysical entity. By
  1979	extension we can also say that the human mind is more machine than
  1980	metaphysical entity. A truly advanced, conscious and replicating,
  1981	self-modifying, amazing machine, but a machine it remains. This
  1982	disturbs many metaphysical minded folks because it has ominous
  1983	consequences, the most ominous being that if WoMankind is
  1984	basically a machine then what about an afterlife? According to
  1985	this model unless some vehicle is generated to contain human
  1986	consciousness there is no life after death.
  1987	
  1988	     Continuing on... Just like a computer we can program our
  1989	minds. School is the primary place of programming. Learning is
  1990	taught very little in schools. Students are supposed to open their
  1991	minds to let the teacher pour in the socially accepted, accredited
  1992	programs. It's no wonder our children hate school. They have the
  1993	genetically driven need to learn, but they perceive they are being
  1994	programmed. Programming and learning are not the same thing. Our
  1995	children perceive the hypocrisy. I rebel against the idea myself.
  1996	
  1997	     However ethical self-programming is a different item
  1998	altogether. Folks like Leary, Wilson, Alpert, and Lilly, tell us
  1999	that some techniques can indeed change our minds. Techniques like
  2000	focused meditation, positive visualization, brain machines and
  2001	chemical alteration are powerful tools for brain change.
  2002	
  2003	     Personally I've used positive visualization to some success.
  2004	Focused meditation is probably the best current legal technique.
  2005	More powerful techniques are brain machines which use a feature of
  2006	the brain to train the brain into semi-discrete states while
  2007	listening to motivational tapes. The most powerful and most
  2008	dangerous tools are psycho-active drugs. These are generally used
  2009	to demolish existing emotional structures which might compete with
  2010	the newly forming, more delicate emotional structures. This
  2011	wrecking crew is composed of any of the psycho-active drugs
  2012	available. The most popular are LSD, 'shrooms, XTC and pot. All of
  2013	these drugs tie back into circuit 5 so there is a double whammy
  2014	involved with their usage. For some people demolition of emotional
  2015	structures works well. Others would just freak.
  2016	
  2017	     Currently these drugs are illegal. Our society has some
  2018	difficult problems to face with respect to mind-altering
  2019	substances. The primitive (and now our contemporary) shaman has
  2020	used plant substances to alter brain chemistry for some 30,000
  2021	years. I have a fairly extensive reading list for these
  2022	metaprogramming substances. Perhaps this is subject matter for an
  2023	addendum.
  2024	
  2025	     Brain machines and disciplined meditation seem to be the most
  2026	powerful legal tools. These are able to softly rearrange the minds
  2027	programming without demolishing whole structures. As time marches
  2028	on brain machines will progress. I presume that at some point, the
  2029	most powerful models will become illegal. Figures.

  2031	     Circuit 8 experiences...
  2032	
  2033	     Circuit 8 is very mystical. Writing about circuit 8 for me is
  2034	difficult. I have a limited understanding of it. This is probably
  2035	because Mike is a 7 circuit person. However Ammond is an 8 circuit
  2036	person so maybe I should let him take over for awhile... <tee hee>
  2037	
  2038	     Hey, Ammond. Wake up!
  2039	
  2040	     "Uhhum, what? Oh, circuit 8 is the metaphysiological circuit.
  2041	This can be interpreted in two ways. [This is boring you know.
  2042	Mike doesn't really like this stuff so i think it's a great idea
  2043	to let the experts cover their fields. He can be such a stuffed
  2044	shirt at times. You fundamentalist! Get a clue Mike! Let go. Have
  2045	fun.  Jeeze, it won't hurt your reputation too much. People won't
  2046	think you're crazy or nothin.]"
  2047	
  2048	     I dislike self-made, so-called experts turkey. Did you know
  2049	that an expert is a 'has-been drop of water under pressure??'
  2050	
  2051	     "Ok, let's get on with this... [i knew we weren't going to
  2052	get anywhere. He's supposed to be writing this stuff, not me.
  2053	Always leaving it to the little guy.] Ok, where did i leave my
  2054	magick book? Here it is under the pickled frogs. Jeeze i hate that
  2055	smell... This whole place has that horrid smell. Should open some
  2056	windows. It's springtime. I'm giving up pickling small animals.
  2057	The larger ones can stay in the yard...
  2058	
  2059	     Circuit 8, yes i'm familiar with that area. Any progressive
  2060	magician is, or rather should be. The term magick is a squirrely
  2061	thing. It's hard to pin down. It took me almost a year and a few
  2062	thousand pins to get it pinned down on my magicians viewing
  2063	matrix.  Darn pins, kept backing out somehow. Magick. Hummpf!
  2064	
  2065	     It can been seen in two lights. One is the mystical view,
  2066	which i subscribe to. i couldn't be a real magician if i didn't.
  2067	Rules you know. Damn unions, always making impromptu
  2068	proclamations.  Do this, do that. Believe this. I'm ready to quit
  2069	and become a customer service engineer. I can fix anything. At
  2070	least i could make some real money. Might even get a car...
  2071	
  2072	     Where was i? Oh yeah, two lights. Some folks like to believe
  2073	in mysterious metaphysical powers. It all works together you know.
  2074	Somehow. Like attracts like in contradiction to current physics.
  2075	So whatever you work for you somehow magickally get. Or at least
  2076	something like what you wanted. Hard to tell at times. It
  2077	generally depends upon how much you want something. And how hard
  2078	you work at it.
  2079	
  2080	     The other view is that natural laws haven't been fully
  2081	appreciated, uhh, understood yet. This revolves around strange
  2082	things like 'information' and 'consciousness', 'charm' and
  2083	'quarks' and such intellectual sillyness. Generally the idea is
  2084	that we are all linked in a network of sorts. When we find the
  2085	proper technologies and applications we should be able to slide
  2086	around on the net, doing and going to different places in a flash.
  2087	Sounds like hooey to me. i prefer magick, it's simpler."
  2088	
  2089	     Thanx for that helpful explanation Ammond, I'll take it from
  2090	here. Cranky this morning??
  2091	
  2092	     "Not a damn bit!"
  2093	
  2094	     Know what you're doing?
  2095	
  2096	     "Yep, it's all in this here magick book. Cernunnos on a
  2097	crutch! Where did it go? Magick book, hummph! Just about gotta'
  2098	keep it on a steel leash. Here it is under the pickled snakes.
  2099	I'll just mosey over and put it back where it belongs. Oh yeah,
  2100	the front door is open. Bye. Don't make a mess on the way out,
  2101	will ya'? This stuff is hard to replace. Where'd that infernal
  2102	book go?"
  2103	
  2104	     Ok, to continue from the previous paragraphs. Quantum physics
  2105	has been bringing us some strange information. Mostly it says that
  2106	our views of the universe affect our perception of the universe so
  2107	what we think we see is really something else. Or something like
  2108	that. You'll have to get the information yourself. There are some
  2109	good and bad books on this subject. Be careful of what you pick up
  2110	at the bookstore. Somehow those books jump right off the shelf at
  2111	you saying buy me, read me. You'd think there was something magic
  2112	about it all.
  2113	
  2114	     Experiencing good synchronicity is a good example of circuit
  2115	8 being active. Jane Roberts, another aspecter of fame, has a lot
  2116	to say on following one's impulses. Of course Jung is the one who
  2117	coined the term Synchronicity.
  2118	
  2119	
  2120	                     The Cyber Lord and Lady
  2121	
  2122	     The CyberLord
  2123	
  2124	     Since this article is being written in the late Fall we'll
  2125	start with the Lord first.
  2126	
  2127	     Who is the CyberLord? In Wicca the horned Lord is the Consort
  2128	of the Lady. His seasons are from Autumnal Equinox to the Vernal
  2129	Equinox. Typically He represents life cycles, birth through death.
  2130	But since CyberCraft is an interpretive metaphor we will try to
  2131	get a little closer to Him.
  2132	
  2133	     CyberCraft holds that the Lord is the divine natural pattern
  2134	of all men. His appearance and lifestyle would depend upon the
  2135	culture in which the CyberNaut lives. Skin color, language,
  2136	lifestyles are all dependent upon one's culture and need.
  2137	
  2138	     We are told by our predecessors that we don't create the
  2139	Gods, we name them. Yet some might pursue a natural manifestation
  2140	that is a little too far or distant for the individual to maintain
  2141	a solid psychic link with. Mireca Eliade tells us that supreme
  2142	Gods generally always are replaced with more local, more relative,
  2143	lesser Gods. Therefore we offer the Cyber Lord as that more
  2144	relative and personal deity.
  2145	
  2146	     His home is the homes of men, His loves the loves of men. He
  2147	is the complete and perfect pattern of all human males. He is the
  2148	best of all possible human male entities. His abilities are the
  2149	highest that mankind can ever hope for plus a little to keep us
  2150	guessing. And He is complete in his animalness. Raw viral power is
  2151	His to command. His keen, perceptive, piercing intelligence tracks
  2152	the quarry from birth to death. His building and engineering
  2153	skills are sufficient to take mankind from dank cave to reliable
  2154	inter- stellar, inter-galactic transportation systems.
  2155	
  2156	     He is the seed-bearer. His semen can fecundate while His
  2157	powers can decimate. Half the information codes that terra-form
  2158	new Gaias frolic within his divine form. His nature is of fire and
  2159	air- -of doing.
  2160	
  2161	     But He is not a goody-two-shoes. He knows the way of birth
  2162	and death, of creation and destruction. He knows that in open and
  2163	closed systems, placement and replacement both have a place in the
  2164	dance of whirling, living systems. He has a dark side but it's not
  2165	evil. His is a life-affirming darkness as opposed to life-denying
  2166	darkness. There is a life-denying darkness. It lies in the realm
  2167	of Patrus.
  2168	
  2169	
  2170	     The CyberLady
  2171	
  2172	     She, like the Lord, is the divine pattern of all women. The
  2173	best they can ever be plus just a little to surprise us. She is
  2174	the Creatrix of the race, and with Her links to Gaia she is the
  2175	matrifocal property owner of the race. Hers is more a creating and
  2176	nurturing spirit where the Lord's is knowing and doing. From Her
  2177	breasts comes the multi-visceral ambrosia which sustains all human
  2178	life. Her Nature is of water and earth--of sustaining.
  2179	
  2180	     Her form is also relative to the race and culture of the
  2181	CyberNaut. She has a light and dark nature but again they are
  2182	life- affirming. The Matrix contains life-denying processes. Her
  2183	form is a evolutionary raised animal form reflecting both woman's
  2184	primitive and star nature. She will bear us across the wide
  2185	heavens to newer homes.
  2186	
  2187	     Equivalencies
  2188	
  2189	     The Lord and Lady share many of the same powers. This is
  2190	reflected in our genetic heritage. Neither Lady nor Lord is
  2191	supreme. They are the powers of the species. And they do not serve
  2192	the other except in the genetically driven processes assigned by
  2193	the Matrix and Patrus. They are equal but completely perfect in
  2194	their separate abilities.  Both serve the Matrix and Patrus, not
  2195	by Commandment, but by pattern and nature.
  2196	
  2197	     Representations
  2198	
  2199	     Each CyberNaut, CyberPriest and CyberPriestess has the power
  2200	and authority to create representations of the Lady and Lord. Were
  2201	it not so we would not have the power and authority to procreate
  2202	from Their genetic stocks.
  2203	
  2204	     This author envisions the Lord as younger, utterly handsome,
  2205	virile, with short hair and a strong energyform body. I see Him as
  2206	agile and adept at plumbing the sub-atomic depths and the
  2207	brilliant cores of galaxies.
  2208	
  2209	     The Lady is dark and divine. Her beauty stupefies and
  2210	exhilarates. Her cool touch electrifies and energizes. Her breath
  2211	animates. Her single glance can mortify and elevate a human to
  2212	seventh heavens.
  2213	
  2214	     Their powers spring from within and reach to the outermost
  2215	realms of matter and energy. Nothing is beyond their caress.
  2216	
  2217	
  2218	
  2219	     Changelings
  2220	
  2221	     From the effects of the Lord and Lady come the progeny who we
  2222	call the Changelings. Those who are mutating the minds are the
  2223	mental Changelings of the Divine Couple. And as time progresses
  2224	our bodies will change as the Lord and Lady prune, shape and
  2225	nurture the human species. We are involved in a labor of love in
  2226	creating a framework to benefit our children and our future
  2227	selves.
