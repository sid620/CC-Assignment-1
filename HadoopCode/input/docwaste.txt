     2	   ATTENTION ALL PROGRAMMERS...... I download alot of Shareware
     3	   programs, and find many of them to be at least useful, if not great.
     4	   But, I am real discouraged when I print out the DOCS, and watch my
     5	   printer spitting out blank, or nearly blank pages.  Our planet can
     6	   not afford this waste, and my personal file cabinet is running out
     7	   of space.  COME ON, lets stop wasting our resources.  I get nothing
     8	   out of looking at blank space on a piece of paper.  Next time you
     9	   create a DOC file, how about filling the page.  And those completely
    10	   blank pages (usually page 2 or 3 ) are a total waste.
    11	   It has ome to the point that I have to edit the docs first, to
    12	   eliminate all the waste.  Why should I or anyone else have to do
    13	   this?   Please CONSIDER OUR PLANET, next time you write a DOC file.
    14	   This has annoyed me for a long time, so it feels great to leave
    15	   this message.  Thanks in advance for conserving our resources, next
    16	   time you create a DOC file.
