    11	-----------
    12	
    13	This Fine Arts course was the first "art & technology" course
    14	taught at the University of Victoria. The students involved were
    15	from a variety of disciplines (although, primarily visual arts
    16	students) and had for the most part, little or no previous
    17	exposure to computers. The Computer Lab at the University has, an
    18	array of imperious nerds intent on empire-building, 10 networked
    19	Sun workstations, a few slow Macintoshes, two flatbed scanners,
    20	one PC and some basic pagelayout and photo manipulation software
    21	primarily for the Macintoshes, basic sound/midi equipment, and a
    22	grumpy creative-writing professor who regularly shuffles down the
    23	hall to the faculty-lounge to wash out his teapot. This was
    24	enough equipment to provide glimpses of creative possibilities; I
    25	suspect that enough enthusiasm has been generated to warrant the
    26	purchase of additional equipment and software, and to have this
    27	course offered on a regular basis. A printing press would also be
    28	a nice adjunct to the existing traditional visual art
    29	departments. I have also offered to design and build a virtual
    30	text-based reality (MOO) for the Fine Arts Department.
    31	 
    32	     Although characterized as a "studio course" I felt it more
    33	appropriate to discuss the larger issues involving technology and
    34	contemporary culture and minimize the importance of a through
    35	"knowledge" of specific software. This was accomplished with
    36	handouts and discussions of pertinent articles, screenings of
    37	appropriate films, and contemporary music. Particular attention
    38	was given to networks and interconnectivity in general and of
    39	course, the Internet. Although this was an introductory course,
    40	the exposure to the various resources available through the
    41	Internet encouraged a phenomenally rapid grasp of both digital
    42	dissemination and the (Unix) operating system.

    45	                    
    46	     Course Description: "A flirtatious romp lightly over the
    47	glittering periphery of digital technology. Has art and the avant
    48	garde disappeared from view, gradually leaking into an
    49	all-pervasive generalized aestheticism? Could it be that
    50	something that might have once been called art is alive and
    51	flourishing between connected networkers... unbeknownst to
    52	implausible and incestuous art institutions? Are there really
    53	still artists around who think they're making art? Are computer
    54	systems virtually enacting the penultimate hierarchy, enforcing
    55	oppressive political privilege; or are they the new democratic,
    56	means of representation? Has the critical art press stood still
    57	under a deluge of new cultural publications? Have we *all* become
    58	artist? These questions and more...!
    59	
    60	     "An introduction and collaborative overview and analysis of
    61	fairly recent, mid-range, cultural tools and their implied
    62	functions.
    63	
    64	     "Students are encouraged to attend all classes and optimize
    65	their uses of the equipment while exploring various venues
    66	throughout the reserved studio time following the class each
    67	morning. Other facilities on and off-campus will also be
    68	utilized.
    69	
    70	     "A reminder that an informal essay of three to four thousand
    71	words is required for this course. It should be "brimming with
    72	original insight and speculation on contemporary culture and
    73	technology." It may be informal in that it employs creative
    74	writing techniques (contemporary structures, verse, quotations,
    75	dialogue, illustrations, etc.). It may make reference to
    76	contemporary media, including the materials/sources shown in
    77	class.
    78	
    79	     "Also required, is an electronic-portfolio of visual and
    80	audio art projects. This should demonstrate some degree of
    81	familiarity of software and resources covered in the lab. It need
    82	not be an extensive or necessarily cohesive body of work. It
    83	should be strongly suggestive of a developing approach to
    84	technological media."

    91	ESSAYS:
    92	
    93	
    94	
    95	The Dematerialization of Art, Life, and Real Estate.
    96	
    97	"The highest problem of any art is to cause by appearance the
    98	illusion of a higher reality." - Goethe   Although Goethe's exact
    99	meaning is open to interpretation the computer appears to be a
   100	tool ready to meet the spirit of his objectives.  At least in the
   101	minds of many electronic artists.  The computer, particularly
   102	draws the attention of artists today because it epitomizes
   103	current technological development and offers the greatest
   104	potential for exploring new creative places.  If we somehow feel
   105	limited by our imagination, the demands of the marketplace, or
   106	current art theory, the computer is one element that somehow
   107	suggests unlimited potential.  For those who consider themselves
   108	to be Renaissance men and women the computer is a godsend. 
   109	 In addition to being a production tool the computer is a window
   110	on and an interface to the rest of the electronically connected
   111	world.  The computer as production tool switches modes and
   112	becomes a link to countless other artists and resource people
   113	throughout the world.  It only takes a little thought to consider
   114	the possibilities of combining these activities. 
   115	
   116	Analyzing the computer as a creative tool is similar to
   117	considering fire as a system to cook one's dinner.  It can
   118	certainly do that but it has some other dimensions and
   119	possibilities.  Understanding the realm of the computer and its
   120	companion data highways is pertinent to its effective use.  What
   121	context does art occupy when it uses electronic space?  What new
   122	creative possibilities does it present, what are its
   123	limitations..  audience..  temporal qualities.. style..
   124	control... access..  money..  appropriation..  credibility..?  Is
   125	there a new underlying language used to create and read
   126	art-cyberart.  Can traditional art fit into the cyberworld?  Can
   127	Venus de Milo be digitized and stored on to a hard drive and
   128	still be a credible work of art?  
   129	
   130	The computer as creative tool dematerializes the process of
   131	production.  A painter might personally mix gallons of paint,
   132	spend hours making canvases, wait for paint to dry, spill paint
   133	on his clothes or make a small rip in his canvas.  None of this
   134	is a factor or even a possibility when the image maker uses Adobe
   135	Illustrator.  Is any of this an influencing factor in creating
   136	culturally significant images.  Can these qualities be duplicated
   137	and available in another set of pull-down menus? 
   138	The materiality of art has always been a significant dimension,
   139	not only of its final form but in influencing the creative
   140	process.  Subtleties expressed by Russian sable and bamboo from
   141	the Mediterranean will present a challenge to future programmers. 
   142	Can computers replicate the interaction between traditional
   143	tools, natural materials, and chance occurrence?  The future of
   144	media such as metal-plate etching and lithography may be
   145	perpetuated because of their distinctiveness or they may simply
   146	become an archaic mode to be mimicked by a graphics program.  
   147	However, computers can give us some interesting interpretations
   148	of materials.  Swiftly moving granite-bodied humanoids,
   149	leopard-skinned fish, and chromed-metal mountains may constitute
   150	kitsch imagery but they prove that the computer does genuinely
   151	extend the dynamic range of expression. 
   152	
   153	The lack of materiality in creating art is perhaps secondary to
   154	the non-existence of the completed art work.  Although the
   155	finished piece may reside in digital form as a description in
   156	computer code it can only take physical form by another process
   157	of creation, usually mechanical.  This re-creation requires an
   158	interpretation of the original and removes the artist from the
   159	final completed piece.  Psychologically it places him/her in the
   160	category of being a symbolic language worker and analogous to
   161	being a data entry clerk. This method of production mirrors other
   162	mass produced consumer products and merchandise from the music
   163	and entertainment industry.  Questions of authenticity,
   164	provenance, place and uniqueness all affect the value and purpose
   165	of computer generated art work.  So..  can computers be used to
   166	create high art?  
   167	
   168	Conversely, artists can now extend their domain greatly.  Most
   169	significantly, they can jump the fences of the traditional
   170	cultural gate keepers.  Since most establishment galleries have a
   171	focused audience, limited budgets, and aesthetic agendas the
   172	opportunities for new or alternative works are limited.  Informal
   173	electronic galleries can post computer files with minimal cost
   174	and provide many more times the exposure of individual galleries. 
   175	Although some electronic galleries will probably develop their
   176	own gate-keeping qualities the diversity and the large number of
   177	computer installations will probably always provide unique
   178	opportunities for new and non-mainstream art to find an audience. 
   179	
   180	Artists that create work for the realm of computers and networks
   181	will find interesting discussions regarding copyright, access,
   182	file standards, reproduction rights, appropriation, modification,
   183	and methods of electronic payment.
   184	
   185	New display systems will continue to be developed for outputting
   186	computer files.  Since more and more programs are incorporating
   187	3D functions the interest in VVDs (volume visualization displays)
   188	is growing.  Since the promises of holography and Star Trek to
   189	bring live, full motion, 3D images into our living room has not
   190	materialized, computer controlled optical-mechanical systems are
   191	being developed.  "Holographic displays show some long-term
   192	potential but they can not be generated in real time.  Their
   193	field of view is fundamentally limited, and these displays
   194	typically change their characteristics with the angle from which
   195	they are viewed." As an alternative, Texas Instruments has
   196	produced its Omniview device that allows the display of volumes
   197	in volumetric space.  
   198	Until recently, 3D images have only been displayed on two
   199	dimensional CRTs and have required the inclusion of standard
   200	perspective cues such as shadows, texture gradients, and relative
   201	size comparisons.  Stereo 3D systems have relied on the use of
   202	special glasses to simulate surface depth but could not allow
   203	movement around a three dimensional object.  VVD displays use a
   204	rotating disk that fills the display volume, creating a surface
   205	point at any location in a half-round ball space.  Then by using
   206	laser beams directed by X, Y, & Z computer controllers, images
   207	can be projected to any point in the volume.  The concept is
   208	similar to the pictures drawn at laser shows but here 3 beams are
   209	used.  
   210	A 36 inch diameter version has been built but a 10 foot diameter
   211	model is feasible.  A viewer can circle the display sphere and
   212	see a three dimensional object from all directions while it moves
   213	in real time.  The display's resolution can be changed to any
   214	desired value by redirecting the scanning system to overlap
   215	points.  VVD resolution is expressed in voxels (vo lume  pi
   216	xels).  Early prototypes had 12,000 voxels, while current models
   217	display 70,000.  Three lasers of different colours can provide a
   218	three-colour image or they can be mixed to provide a full colour
   219	palette.  Presently, VVD systems require powerful computers to
   220	calculate 3D display data.  Originally developed for the U.S.
   221	Department of Defense this technology's future will probably be
   222	more applicable to non military purposes.  
   223	Proposed applications include air traffic control visualization. 
   224	Air traffic controllers could look into the sphere and see the
   225	exact location, continuous movement and distance relationship
   226	between circling airplanes.  Pointing to a plane with a laser
   227	beam would bring up its information on the computer screen. 
   228	Other uses include medical diagnosis, weather pattern analysis,
   229	and remote control of space station docking.  Visual artists
   230	could use this system to pre visualize sculpture projects, for
   231	choreography and to output 3D animation sequences.  
   232	
   233	The use of more conventional output devices will increase to
   234	materialize images and objects designed in the abstract world of
   235	the computer.  CNC (Computer Numerical Control) equipment
   236	designed for the metal production industry and XY plotters can be
   237	used to cut out images in wood, vinyl, metal, or fabric.  Three
   238	dimensional milling machines can materialize objects for
   239	sculpture and 3D animation.  
   240	Existing 3D works and artifacts can be digitized, stored, and
   241	recreated in many different locations.  Unlimited serial editions
   242	of 3D work could become more popular.  
   243	The production of two dimensional works, including print
   244	publishing have created a need for the service bureau that
   245	specializes in outputting files for the artist and publisher. 
   246	Future service bureaus will expand their systems to cover video,
   247	3D media, and large-scale 2D imaging.  Since specialized
   248	equipment is required to materialize creative ideas, the artist
   249	will more often be forced to conceive and work on his ideas in
   250	the realm of the abstract.  In many cases the artist will only
   251	see the final completion of his work after sending the files to
   252	the "Service Bureau". 
   253	
   254	The total extent of cyberspace integration is still to be
   255	determined.  Presently thousands of computers are connected
   256	through various networks such as the Internet, private commercial
   257	systems, open commercial systems, and hacker systems like
   258	FidoNet.  Although most are platform independent there are still
   259	fairly narrow constraints on the type of data exchanged.  There
   260	are parallel communications systems like land telemetry networks
   261	that monitor geological conditions, traffic movement, electrical
   262	power transmission, radar information and satellites that handle
   263	telecommunications and video signals.  
   264	As more and more communications move away from the analog to the
   265	digital world as high definition television is soon expected to
   266	do the more integration of signals will occur.  It is interesting
   267	to consider that a computer could order extra oxygen supplies
   268	from Missouri when its sensors determine a high level of air
   269	pollution in Los Angeles.  Or that stock market futures price of
   270	grain would change after a computer analyzed infrared images of
   271	world crops.  
   272	Artists might consider interactive works that are affected by
   273	natural forces, commercial activity, or combinations of
   274	conditions sensed by cyberlinks.  
   275	
   276	The networks will become a great source of ideas, feedback, and
   277	will present opportunities for collaboration.  Art created for a
   278	world culture will need more than an North American perspective. 
   279	A description of a Russian created program El-Fish states that
   280	"Russian programmers couldn't write successful accounting
   281	programs because they don't know about western business
   282	culture...but their culture developed sensibilities that combined
   283	beauty and non-utility".  Artistic teams from different parts of
   284	the world can co-operate to create the best cultural products for
   285	a world audience. 
   286	
   287	As the digital bit becomes the standard building block for all
   288	information we will have greater interchangablity and
   289	interconnectivity.  Nicholas Negroponte states that  "all
   290	information providers will be in a common business - the bit
   291	radiation business - not radio, TV, magazines or newspapers". 
   292	Advantages include being able to quickly construct many specific
   293	versions of a production and the non-material storage of
   294	products.  Large numbers of books no longer have to auditioned
   295	because of the advent of print-on-demand printing systems.  Many
   296	constructed realities will possibly only exist in digital form.  
   297	
   298	Unfortunately we may also develop creative techniques in one
   299	digital medium and simply apply them to others, maybe
   300	inappropriately.  A music sequencer program allows you to
   301	Quantize while a photo manipulation program allows you to
   302	Equalize.  They both use a common root technique of normalizing
   303	but specific digital manipulation concepts might not have
   304	universal application.  However, is there expanded creativity in
   305	doing musical things to pictures and visa versa? 
   306	
   307	The enthusiasm for the digital domain does have some detractors. 
   308	Analog constructions do have specific qualities that are
   309	aesthetically pleasing.  They might not be able to be justified
   310	technically but certain nuances inherent in analog
   311	interpretations are artistically valid.  Chemical imaging systems
   312	still create movies that are more pleasing to the eye.  Tube
   313	amplifiers create a unique sound that can't really be duplicated
   314	by digital sound.  As in other transitions we will loose some
   315	important characteristics and abilities when we adopt new
   316	technologies.  
   317	
   318	The cyberworld and computer created information obviously have
   319	their own language.  Marshal McLuhan was convinced that the
   320	medium is really the message.  Although content is significant
   321	when evaluating a short term experience, the inherent qualities
   322	of a medium are really what constitutes the overall message.  TV
   323	really communicates passivity and mass conformity.  The message
   324	of cyberspace is still being considered.  The technical language
   325	of the cyberspace system is still in a tyrannical realm of linear
   326	text.  Totally unforgiving of errors in letters & case it exerts
   327	a blind totalitarian control over the mechanics or structure of
   328	the system.  However, the highly defined structure of the system
   329	opens an anarchic realm of interrelationships and interactions of
   330	possibilities.  
   331	Perhaps the key distinguishing characteristic of the cyberworld
   332	is interactively.  Users of the Internet are able to make more
   333	conscious choices about the information they receive, they can
   334	gather data into their own local electronic spheres, and they can
   335	interact with other users & information providers.  We can assume
   336	that one message from cyberspace is activity rather than
   337	passivity. Coach potato mode will not work with a cyberspace
   338	screen.  
   339	
   340	Art has generally catered to the passive viewer.  Although modern
   341	art has incorporated participatory elements and some interactive
   342	schemes most of the ideas are expressed in a one-way
   343	communications mode.  Art galleries create interaction or choice
   344	by having patrons physically move from one location or art work
   345	to another. In most cases the cyberart will be presented to the
   346	viewer at his/her location.  Instead of a nail on a wall, the
   347	computer will be a much more sophisticated display system.  The
   348	digital nature of art will allow the viewer, if he so desires, to
   349	alter the artist s work, to appropriate it or to simply reject it
   350	by destroying the electronic file. 
   351	
   352	The visual style of cyberart often follows the myriad of choices
   353	the system provides.  A complex system creates complex imagery.
   354	Interactive CD s offer menu screens with dozens of preview
   355	images. Text is supported by images.  Images are augmented with
   356	text.  Sound is added to business communications and moving image
   357	segments like QuickTime files are attached to technical reports. 
   358	Ideas are expressed through layering several modes of expression. 
   359	Pedagogical theory has always supported multi-modal
   360	communications and now we have the technology to accomplish it.
   361	In addition to painting, photography or sculpture, media such as
   362	MacroMind Director, Hypercard,  electronic games, CD-I, 3D0 and
   363	virtual reality systems may be relevant choices for artists.  The
   364	future expression of ideas will require a layered, multi-modal
   365	strategy that elaborates and gives the user choices and the
   366	opportunity to participate.  Simple two-dimensional images may
   367	have difficulty finding a place in cyberspace.  
   368	
   369	The plastic arts have referred to traditional sources for their
   370	theory and inspiration.  Modernism embraced Marxism while Post
   371	Modernism welcomes Neitzche back.  The cyberpunks have created
   372	their own set of philosophers, all of which are found in the
   373	Science Fiction section of the library.  Asimov, Pohl, Arthur C.
   374	Clark and Robert Heinlein are some.  "If Marvin Minsky had his
   375	way, there would always be a visiting science fiction writer in
   376	residence at the Media Lab."  Will the artist who chooses to work
   377	in the Cybersphere have to pay closer attention to science
   378	fiction to better understand its roots?  Can Marx and Azimov
   379	co-exist?
   380	
   381	How involved should artists become in the technology of the
   382	cyberspace?  In the past many artists have been content to have a
   383	technician organize the technical processes of art production. 
   384	Although the artist may not have had the technical skill to
   385	complete the task he usually understood the process as it related
   386	to his artistic needs.  However, to participate in the cyberspace
   387	community it may demand a greater level of technical commitment.  
   388	Alan Kay pointed out that the computer is not a medium but rather
   389	a meta-medium.  In other words, with a computer you can create
   390	media.  
   391	Artists have previously been in the habit of simply adopting the
   392	materials and tools created by engineers and the industrial
   393	production system.  MIT's MediaMoo is a good example of a
   394	cyberspace reality that is being created through technical
   395	knowledge, interest from a wide range of "characters", social
   396	interaction, and some artistry.  Future virtual realities will
   397	require equal amounts artistic and technical input.  It will be
   398	most effective if artists can express their artistry through a
   399	strong understanding of technology.  In fact, artists will be
   400	excluded from many potential interesting environments if they do
   401	not develop the technical skills to communicate in the new
   402	electronic world.
   403	
   404	Jaron Lanier says that we can use "post-symbolic" communication
   405	to create shared realities.   A virtual reality system will
   406	create a beach when we say: "Let's go for a swim".  Instead of
   407	using symbols to describe the beach, we create an electronic
   408	version of a real beach.  
   409	Symbolism, which is the key to semiotic interpretations of our
   410	culture may find new roles in visual communication.  Whenever we
   411	use a system that constructs new realities,  then the established
   412	cultural symbols or icons, which are short cuts to perception,
   413	may become pass or boring.  Any reference to past cultural
   414	symbols would immediately signify fantasy.  Artists will have to
   415	look past much of our visual and semiotic heritage to construct
   416	credible virtual worlds.
   417	
   418	Computers, networks, and the machines that they exchange
   419	information with are multiplying at an incredible rate.  They are
   420	constructing a new set of possibilities and destroying others.  
   421	The traditional artist who is interested in entering the
   422	cyberworld will have to make many changes.  The creative
   423	environment is abstract and dematerialized. Your ideas will be
   424	neatly reconstructed into uniform bits ready to be radiated
   425	throughout the system.
   426	Although you will have many opportunities to distribute your work
   427	around the world it will not receive the hallowed treatment
   428	reserved for gallery exhibitions.  It will compete freely with
   429	countless images, interactive programs, video, digitized audio,
   430	games, and people. 
   431	
   432	You will start to read science fiction.  You will try to find the
   433	best service bureau to make hard copies your photos, graphics,
   434	and sculpture projects. You will find creative partners in
   435	Ethiopia.
   436	
   437	You will take up computer programming so that you can create new
   438	real estate in a Florida MOO.  You will drop sculpting and take
   439	up MacroMind Director.  You will forget about cultural symbols
   440	and icons.  You will save hard for a VVD display system.  You
   441	will not need expensive real estate because you can watch your
   442	virtual reality beach.

   450	Chapter One - Media and Advertising
   451	
   452	
   453	 What is the role of technology in the media? The media has
   454	traditionally been a way of conveying events ( political,
   455	entertainment,  human interest ) to the public at large. The
   456	media is in the information business and relies heavily on
   457	technology to transmit information from one place to another.
   458	Today, we tend to think of technology with a sort of  high - tech
   459	this is so modern day  attitude. That technology is the wave of
   460	the future is evident but it is important to recognize that
   461	technology is also a part of our past, and understand the
   462	relationships between past technology with that of today.
   463	Technology was the wave of the future thousands of years ago,
   464	technology is like another word for progress, synonymous with
   465	advancement or moving forward in time, technology is the newest
   466	and the latest and is a habitual quest of mankind to increase
   467	his/her capabilities in his/her environment. Domestication of
   468	crops was technology, what about fire - the greatest invention of
   469	all? Technology has always been a driving force in the history of
   470	the human race and with technology a desire for communication is
   471	also deeply rooted in our collective heritage. People have made
   472	illustrations and created writing systems to communicate and
   473	document their histories. Language was also created for smoother
   474	communication and has become increasingly complex. As the world
   475	has increased so has it s level of communication. The media as we
   476	know it largely developed in the wake of modern technology.
   477	Before radio, telegraphs, planes and trains, the world relayed
   478	events to other parts of the world through human travellers and
   479	by letter which would have gone by carriage or boat. With the
   480	radio, events of significance (for whatever reason) could be
   481	broadcast worldwide within a few short hours. With the invention
   482	of planes came aerial warfare and the real possibility that a
   483	country thousands of miles away had the practical means of
   484	invasion and conquest of your own homeland. Enter: the media.
   485	People then and now relied on the media, the radio, the telegraph
   486	and later their television to receive information they now
   487	considered critical to their existence. Out of newspaper
   488	advertising developed radio and later T.V. commercials - the
   489	point at which media and advertising became inexplicably and
   490	forever linked in popular culture. So where does that leave the
   491	media in the modern world? Should the media have to maintain a
   492	moral responsibility to the public? What are the attitudes of the
   493	public to the media? How many people are unaware of the biases
   494	and often self - serving motives that are prevalent in media or
   495	newsgroups today? The resources that the media have been able to
   496	utilize in the twentieth century have changed the face of
   497	advertising indefinitely, and unfortunately deception is
   498	unavoidable.At this point in time many people are still unaware
   499	of the resources available to the media and because of this
   500	widespread ignorance are oblivious to the manipulation of their
   501	minds and psyche by powerful mega-bucks-money-hungry
   502	manufacturers and corporations. An excellent example of this
   503	mindless manipulation in advertising where technology has been
   504	utilized would be photo - manipulation or perhaps plastic
   505	surgery. Combined, the use of these two areas in conjunction with
   506	advertising are one the leading contributors in the continuing
   507	lack of self - esteem of women in North America. The widespread
   508	image of the idealized woman is often created through technology
   509	: elaborate and painstaking make -up, photo manipulation through
   510	lighting, airbrushing, touch ups, varied films and high contrast
   511	filters; these can all be used to create a false image - one
   512	which is unfortunately high sought after and is in most cases
   513	unattainable. The cause of this disastrous situation cannot be
   514	blamed on the high - tech features that are available in present
   515	day, aerial warfare cannot be blamed on the invention of planes.
   516	People so often place the blame of an unfortunate situation on
   517	technology because it is crucial to the existence of the
   518	situation  - the situation is dependant on the invention; it is
   519	human nature that develops and determines the course an
   520	advancement in technology will take.  
   521	
   522	
   523	Chapter Two - Interconnectedness
   524	
   525	 As technology increases, communication also increases and with
   526	these increases follows a sense of interconnection. Connectedness
   527	should be the opposite of isolation, but they are, in some ways
   528	very closely related. I will show this relationship as it exists
   529	in a narrative; a day in the life of a fictitious character - Mr.
   530	TypaLot. 
   531	 
   532	          
   533	          A Day in the Life of Mr. Typalot
   534	                   by b. bigelow
   535	
   536	   
   537	
   538	   Mr. Typalot lives in the suburbs of Vancouver, in Delta, B.C.
   539	He lives in nice home in a prestigious area with his wife and 2.2
   540	children. He works in the city, and has to commute each today. He
   541	leaves his house at 7:40 every morning to make the commute to
   542	Vancouver. He takes his briefcase (laptop computer inside), his
   543	cellular phone, and a mug of fresh, automatic-machine-made
   544	coffee. His commute though lengthy, goes quickly because he
   545	spends much of his time talking on the phone (usually to other
   546	colleagues also on their way to work).Mr. Typalot is perhaps a
   547	researcher, an advertising executive, or maybe a systems analyst.
   548	He types a lot, mostly into his Unix at work, his laptop, or at
   549	his Macintosh in his den at home. When he isn t typing, he is
   550	talking, sometimes on a telephone, sometimes not. Mr. Typalot
   551	communicates with people all over the world everyday via. e -
   552	mail, fax, phone and answering machines, and through virtual
   553	reality set-ups such as MediaMOO. He develops all kinds of
   554	relationships with people in the course of his day, but he is
   555	also everyday increasing his relationship with inaminate devices.
   556	It can not be avoided, in his relationship building with other
   557	people it is necessary for him to interact with machines - it is
   558	a necessity of his success in the workplace. Mr. Typalot is
   559	isolated in a indirect way everyday. Each day for several hours
   560	he is deprived of any sensory stimulation that is not available
   561	to him through his terminal or workstation. Mr, Typalot is
   562	experiencing sensory isolation.  
   563	 The narrative of Mr. Typalot is a generic example of what many
   564	people in the workplace experience. Mr. Typalot is perhaps more
   565	extreme than the  norm  but as communications in technology
   566	advance, more and more people will have workdays that fit this
   567	description. This type of connectedness or advanced communication
   568	has ups as well as downs - the downside involves a lack of
   569	direct, or face-to-face contact, and a loss of the more human
   570	side or traditional interaction between people. On the up side,
   571	is the opportunity to engage in a virtual reality experience; to
   572	participate in a highly imaginative and creative realm which I
   573	could only previously describe as becoming deeply involved with a
   574	very intensely written novel. These text based virtual realities,
   575	such as MediaMoo are highly creative and intellectually
   576	stimulating - as well as fun. They can be a good alternative to
   577	traditional reading because the player can actually participate
   578	and contribute to the  story . Virtual Realities might ce
   579	beneficial in educating children and adults - making learning
   580	enjoyable and interesting. They might also contribute to a higher
   581	self esteem in children/teenagers as they maintain some type of
   582	control, responsibility, and exercise their ability to produce.
   583	On the other hand, V.R.s could be less than beneficial to some
   584	individuals as they might become more drawn into the V.R. than
   585	might be perceived as healthy. I sometimes envision a situation
   586	similar to the Dungeon and Dragon scenario where in several cases
   587	the individuals involved with the game had a difficult time
   588	distinguishing between real life and  fantasy . The bottom line
   589	is that each individual is different and will react to virtual
   590	realities in their own way; that a few select cases cannot
   591	determine the outcome of thousands of others. 
   592

   595	
   596	Chapter Two - Interconnectiveness
   597	
   598	Part Two - The Role of Technology in the Lives of Special Needs
   599	People.
   600	
   601	
   602	 Technology can go along way in contributing to the quality of
   603	lifestyle in the lives of those with special needs.  For the
   604	deaf, the computer can be a fabulous way of communicating and
   605	reaching out to others. Autistic people who at times may have
   606	difficulty interacting with other people often are very skilled,
   607	and enjoy working at  a computer workstation. People confined to
   608	a wheelchair  have many more career opportunities than ever
   609	before thanks to the computer and  a continuing growth of more
   610	sophisticated software. In the instance of a brother of a friend
   611	mine ( we ll call him Jim), the computer has literally been his
   612	salvation. After a severe car accident, Jim lost the movement of
   613	both legs - he will be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of
   614	his life.  Jim comes from a family of artists and before his
   615	accident he was  a working artist painting in a traditional
   616	sense. Now Jim works with computer graphics - doing freelance and
   617	contract work. New software has made it easier, and more
   618	convenient for people like Jim to continue working.  There are
   619	many fields to work in , ie. research, data entry, etc. In the
   620	case of special needs children - those with learning disabilities
   621	or the developmentally delayed; a constant stimulus is one of the
   622	most important factors in the mental ( and physical) development.
   623	Traditionally, this constant stimulus has been provided by
   624	support workers, but lack of funding ( gov t and private) often
   625	leads to special needs children  not receiving the one on one
   626	stimulus they need and deserve. While the computer might not be
   627	considered an adequate substitute for human stimulus, it would
   628	still be better than nothing and would probably make a positive
   629	contribution to the development of the child. Children are drawn
   630	to computers - to the bright colors, movement and sound emote
   631	from them. Unlike television, computers can be more interactive
   632	and will encourage and prompt a child to participate. I don t
   633	know where computer stimulus will lead, but certainly it is
   634	better for the intellectual growth - and even motor skills than
   635	most of the programs children watch on T.V. The same can be
   636	applied to special needs adults, for while these individuals are
   637	in the body of an adult,  often  their intellectual development
   638	hasn t caught up - has been delayed in some way and stimulus and
   639	prompts are still essential to their intellectual growth.  
   640	
   641	
   642	Chapter Three - Technology and Tradition
   643	
   644	Part One: Technology and Tradition
   645	
   646	
   647	 The increases in technology have made communicating in the
   648	twentieth century easier and more convenient than ever before.
   649	Electronic mail, faxes, cellular phones and virtual realities
   650	drastically reduce the amount of time it takes to get a
   651	message/or important documents to an individual. Electronic mail
   652	takes away the envelope, the stamp and the whole structure of the
   653	traditional mail system. There is no pick, transporting the
   654	letter to a sortation plant and sorting of the letter before the
   655	eventual delivery ( of which won,t be in the recipient s hands
   656	until he/she gets home from work,etc. E -mail is practical, but
   657	will eventually eliminate a characteristic of the weekday as many
   658	people experience it. Coming home to an unexpected card or letter
   659	is a pleasant surprise which would be virtually eliminated in an
   660	electronic mail system. Letters or cards would probably be
   661	received at work in the course of the day, and would be on a
   662	screen - not paper. Paper cards,invitations etc. might still be
   663	sent out (perhaps by private,entrepreunial companies) as a sort
   664	of novelty or maybe on a special occasion. What about wedding
   665	invitations and gold embossed papers? How could one put a wedding
   666	invitation into a photo album if the invitation was on the
   667	screen? ( I guess you could always print out a copy). These small
   668	characteristics of everyday life will probably in the future be
   669	altered to fit into a world where modern technology has spread
   670	into every aspect of our existence. Are there areas that the
   671	notions of convenience and practicality should not enter into?
   672	Areas of our lives that are considered sacred and should be
   673	protected and preserved from the invasion of the driving force
   674	called technology?
   675	
   676	    
   677	
   678	Chapter Three - Technology and Tradition
   679	
   680	Part Two: Technology in the Home.
   681	
   682	
   683	  Technology has always affected the home. The Refrigator,
   684	electronic oven, and electrical lighting are a far cry from a gas
   685	lamp illuminated kitchen and a wood burning stove.
   686	 The washer and dryer, disposable diapers and running water have
   687	freed up plenty of time for more enjoyable pursuits like going
   688	for walks or visiting friends but in many instances just
   689	listening to the radio or watching television. We are surrounded
   690	by technology always - modern techno conveniences such as the
   691	telephone (portable,cellular, or other) the microwave, toasters,
   692	coffee makers, VCRS and camcorders. The computer will have more
   693	impact in the home than any other techno convenience since the
   694	television.( or Nintendo). The computer will contribute both to
   695	the organization and the entertainment/leisure activities in the
   696	home -catapulting into a nucleic role which the household could
   697	quite possibly revolve around in the future. Through the computer
   698	a family, individual, etc. could have access to more information
   699	than they could ever hope to tread upon - never mind absorption.
   700	Miscellaneous tasks and activities such as going out to get a
   701	newspaper, borrow a book from the library,get a video or play
   702	arcade games could be fulfilled by simply sitting in front of
   703	keyboard and screen. It is hard to predict what the outcome of
   704	discontinuing traditional activity might be - or if it will
   705	happen at all. The potential is real and the outcome might be
   706	disastrous.  Even a general recognmition by society to admit and
   707	understand this;that the computer in the home and workplace is
   708	potentially harmful to our continued existence, might go a long
   709	way in preserving whatever integrity we have left.
   710	
   711	Chapter Four - Art and Architecture: The Role of Technology
   712	
   713	
   714	  There is a big difference between computer generated art and
   715	art that exists solely in the computer. Computer generated art
   716	can still be accessed in the traditional way, it can hang on your
   717	walls  at home - it can be displayed in a gallery or reproduced
   718	in a book.In this way the art is not dependant on the computer
   719	for it's existence - it can retain an identity seperate from the
   720	computer. In these instances the computer is like a tool the
   721	artist has used to create his/her work, just like a camera, or a
   722	tablesaw. With art that exists solely within the computer, the
   723	images can only be viewed via the computer and nowhere else. It
   724	is a permanent attachment to the piece and it is therefore an
   725	integral element of the work itself. This type of art is
   726	different from traditional art or even independant computer
   727	generated art because it's focus or motives are related to
   728	communications in a different way - an area of communications
   729	which is void of the physical and tangible.This difficult concept
   730	of relaying ideas and information can be thought of as a large
   731	base of information, compiled of the thoughts and interests of
   732	thousands of people.
   733	
   734	  What is the role of the artist within this base of information,
   735	and how will the role of the artist change as a result of
   736	technology? Who is the artist? The artist is foremost a designer;
   737	a person who conceives ideas and then attempts to communicate
   738	those ideas  (sometimes to themselves and sometimes to others)by
   739	representing the ideas in a physical expression. What the
   740	expression will be depends on the the designer. If the designer
   741	is a musician the expression might be a musical score, if the
   742	designer is  an architect than probably a building plan. There
   743	are several advantages to working within a large information base
   744	that over a 100 000 000 million people have access to ( ie. the
   745	Internet).The exposure is tremendous and the opportunity to make
   746	contacts and to to relay ideas is anyone's speculation.  The
   747	electronic art gallery is to the artist today what television
   748	would have been to the actor who was previously only viewed in
   749	live theater. In presenting to the masses through an electronic
   750	network an expression of an idea the artist is able to convey and
   751	communicate thoughts on a widespread level - but to what level of
   752	efficiency? Is something lost in the philosophy if the artist is
   753	able to communicate the the idea to a broad audience but only in
   754	general terms? Is it better to communicate a fuller understanding
   755	of a concept to a limited people instead of a general idea to
   756	thousands? This question can only be answered by the individual -
   757	each artist having their personal agenda which dictates their
   758	actions and motivates their work.
   759	
   760	  It is up to us, the designers and artists to determine and
   761	shape our changing role along with the advancement of technology.
   762	What else can we do? We are forced to go with the flow and
   763	utilize technology to prevent our obsolescence. Technology and
   764	job displacement go hand in hand and the artist and designer are
   765	not an exception. With more and more sophisticated software many
   766	kinds of work in the design industry could easily be sifted out
   767	in the future. Graphic artists, architects, industrial designers
   768	could in all like likelihood be eliminated in future society.
   769	Think of past tradesmen (tradesperson) who no longer have a place
   770	in the world due to technological advancement and new invention?
   771	How many shoemakers have you met recently? The shoemaker was a
   772	tradesman - a designer of a kind and is a scarcity in modern day.
   773	Of course the machine made/pre-fab shoes can never match the
   774	quality of a leather shoe cut and measured specifically to the
   775	individual's foot. One of a kind shoes- each with their own
   776	identity;  a product and design from start to finish of the
   777	individual designer and his/her original vision. The fact is if
   778	it is good enough, if it will get the job done (at least
   779	satisfactorally) then it will be accepted by the masses;leaving
   780	little room for the creativity and ingenuity of the individual
   781	designer. A balance needs to be struck between designer and
   782	computer - a blance where the computer is a tool for the designer
   783	and not the designer itself. Architects and draftspeople now have
   784	the unique advantage of being able to conjure up their changing
   785	visions quicker than they could possible recreate an intricate
   786	drawing by hand.These quickly redrawn views however, only remain
   787	an advantage to the architect etc. if the designer is still the
   788	motivating factor behind the design and is the major contributor
   789	to the end result.

   793	
   794	
   795	                         Preinventing the Wheel
   796	
   797	     Have you had enough of magazine articles and other essays
   798	whose titles play on the word "virtual?" Articles with names like
   799	"Virtual Virtuoso" or " Virtually now" or "Virtigo." I thought as
   800	much. Virtual reality is getting very tired, and it doesn't even
   801	exist yet. It has been able to avoid fading out of public view 
   802	for this long because of its' name, which sounds sufficiently
   803	official, and at the same time vague enough to allow its' use in
   804	context with anything one thinks is neat-o. In the forties, there
   805	was a similar craze for things whose existence was in question,
   806	and it also had a misleading name that made people sound clever.
   807	That name is Existentialism, and before it became popular, it
   808	actually meant something. But it was only taken seriously after a
   809	couple hundred people who hadn't bothered to find out its'
   810	meaning were put in situations where they had to pretend that
   811	they had- hey, presto- 200 false definitions! This confusion is
   812	happening to virtual reality, only not so romantically as it did
   813	in post-war France. A few months ago I had dinner with a good
   814	friend. As we ate he asked me to explain to him what the whole
   815	deal on virtual reality is and I told him, more or less, that it
   816	is the idea of general purpose simulation, and went on to explain
   817	that simulators of this sort need detectors to sense body motions
   818	or speech, devices to stimulate our senses of sight, hearing,
   819	touch, etc., and a computer to connect everything and vary the
   820	interaction according to programs. Then I felt obliged to rehash
   821	the monologue about the many possibilities of the potential
   822	medium, and did, but my friend, who is an Economics major, just
   823	laughed, "Is that all it is, a glorified video-game?! You
   824	actually study that kind of stuff at school? I heard all this
   825	talk on how important it is!" He had been impressed by the
   826	virtual Paul Reveres, the virtual exaggerators, the virtual
   827	newspaper columns with titles like this. It is truly a pity that
   828	the term 'virtual reality' isn't used sparingly, and that 'the
   829	study of simulation' or some like phrase doesn't get all the
   830	attention. Simulators already exist. Because of all this hype,
   831	virtual reality is being made to sound a lot more important than
   832	it is. Virtual reality is being treated like some radical new
   833	science. Ad agencies are cashing in on its' commerciality and
   834	confusing the general population with the meaning of the term.
   835	Fans of virtual reality are trying to convince people that its'
   836	dawn is ridiculously near and thus that its' study is pertinent.
   837	Other virtual reality enthusiasts are preaching that virtual
   838	reality is "the way" and will end racial inequality and give the
   839	repressed a voice. Just as preposterously, academics are solemnly
   840	warning that virtual reality will create a nation of violent
   841	thugs. Others warn of "virtual-reality addictions," seriously;
   842	"virtual-reality addictions." It is sad that a promising
   843	technology has been taken over before it has even reached a
   844	concrete stage, by a bunch of clowns. 
   845	     The driving forces behind virtual reality have been around
   846	for all of human history so why is it considered such a radical
   847	concept? When flight simulation programs started appearing a few
   848	years ago for home computers, a lot of folks bought them (after
   849	all, they were pretty neat) but few sat around yakking about how
   850	those programs were "interactive" as though the word were a drop
   851	from the fountain of profundity. Hell, even a pinball machine is
   852	interactive. What about "Choose Your Own Adventure" books, the
   853	books that let kids make a decision by picking one of two pages
   854	every so often? What kind of novelty is there in trying to fake
   855	the world around us: We started with cave paintings, then
   856	sophisticated paints until we had realistic oils, then the still
   857	photographic camera, the record player, motion pictures, talkies
   858	and what could be more virtual than telephones; the technology
   859	which Bell invented to allow an entire nation of people to
   860	consider talking to banana-shaped objects on street corners a
   861	normal part of life. Theatre is a form of virtual reality as
   862	well. Some like to think that the V.R. will "enlarge our minds"
   863	by making us more imaginative. As though we haven't now any
   864	activities requiring imagination. V.R. is not the first; it is an
   865	element of many games, from Chess through to Scruples. Of all the
   866	things V.R. could be compared to, it is strange that one hears of
   867	the similarities of V.R. and the telephone less often than V.R.
   868	and narcotics. This is the kind of talk that makes V.R. out to be
   869	larger than life. There is a difference between drug-use and
   870	any-old-thing that happens to be bizarre and illogical. That is
   871	why we as a species have been spared an addiction to the writings
   872	of Marshall Macluan. V.R. is not a new concept.
   873	     Virtual reality is also kept well in the public eye by
   874	advertising firms. These firms are resourceful enough to have
   875	found a word associated with V.R. to advertise services or
   876	products in a manner that will make them sound as though they are
   877	on the cutting edge of technology, regardless of the truth. I
   878	have already mentioned the word they use. The word is
   879	"interactive" and it is plastered on everything from phone-sex,
   880	to standard phone-in talk shows, to magazines and automobiles and
   881	children's toys. It is generally assumed that inter-active is
   882	entertaining but who of us really wants to leave our couch to
   883	phone a television station half way through a program. People
   884	watch television to relax. The same goes for reading, listening
   885	to music and looking at pictures. Being interactive isn't all
   886	that thrilling. One spends all one's life in an interactive
   887	world. A lot of it even bores one. Being inter-active is not
   888	necessarily being virtual. It would be kind if advertising
   889	agencies would not try to convince us otherwise. No, we will have
   890	to wait a few years for real reality-simulators.
   891	     How many years? "In the near future," is the standard
   892	phrase. How near? The people who vigilantly claim that V.R. will
   893	be perfected in the next ten years are generally the same people
   894	who talk a lot about terra-forming Mars and making it habitable.
   895	However true it may be that all geniuses are dreamers, it is not
   896	true that all dreamers are geniuses. Some are only poor,
   897	misguided Dr. Who fans. Let's just say it takes thirty years to
   898	develop a graphics system that can display at 24 fps, with
   899	photographic resolution, a stereoscopic alterable landscape-
   900	which would take an insane amount of memory. We'll also say that
   901	by that time we'll have the capability to transmit at real time
   902	the colossal amount of data needed to hook a V.R. machine up to a
   903	network. Then we'll assume (this is more reasonable) that we'll
   904	have a perfectly light-weight, comfortable bodysuit that won't
   905	make one look like a scuba-diver wearing a bicycle helmet. Hey,
   906	they won't be available to everyone. They won't come cheap. It
   907	will take a long while for virtual reality systems to made
   908	compatible. It will be a while for a decent net to cover the
   909	globe. But let's say that it will take around 50 years for V.R.
   910	machines to become common household items. As loose as any figure
   911	based on unprovable guesses must be, 50 years seems like a
   912	reasonable number. What is all the excitement about then? No
   913	current virtual reality- type products, from war games to
   914	video-games, come near to giving a convincingly real feeling.
   915	Just because virtual reality may be right around the corner
   916	doesn't mean we'll see it next year. It's quite possible that
   917	half of us will be dead by the time virtual reality amounts to
   918	something.  
   919	     Some people in these times hold the opinion that V.R. will
   920	be a great social instrument. Sure, after Nintendo rolls a few
   921	tens of thousands of Virtualboys off the assembly line everything
   922	will be jolly. No more wars, no more intolerance. Neo-Nazi
   923	Skinheads will plug in and suddenly turn into nice, decent
   924	fellows and fall to their knees to beg forgiveness from the
   925	minority groups they have been terrorizing an hour before. The
   926	idea is that since people would have the ability to conceal their
   927	identity while using a net we would all be tolerant and
   928	understanding. This would be a compelling argument were it not
   929	for the telephone which already allows us this service.If V.R.
   930	evolves in a similar manner, it will end up with individuals
   931	choosing only to contact close friends. And I know that's not
   932	what the V.R. enthusiasts want. And I know they want it to be a
   933	wild and crazy medium. But there are a lot of folks in the world.
   934	Business people, for example, would get use out of V.R. by using
   935	it for long-distance conferences or perhaps for models of
   936	products, or real estate. They would not find it useful to
   937	pretend to be a Virtual-prawn on the Cyberspace-Oceanfloor
   938	Network. People could do a lot of things on V.R. networks, not
   939	all of them brotherly. Thanks to V.R. it would be a lot easier
   940	for racist people to form world-wide organizations.. they could
   941	congregate daily if they chose. It is just about as likely that
   942	V.R. will correct the world's problems as it is that a crumpet
   943	will corrupt a swinging mallet. On the other hand V.R. will not
   944	spell a return to the dark ages.
   945	     The idea is that someday children will be weaned on V. R.
   946	sets. They will get used to regularly lopping off virtual heads
   947	and so, when they grow older, they'll be conditioned, see, and
   948	they'll go nuts and they'll lop off real peoples heads. No matter
   949	how much you show people that there is no evidence to support the
   950	claim that there is a correlation between violence in the media
   951	and violence in real life they just don't learn. For once and for
   952	all, violence in the media is a good thing because it teaches
   953	children to distinguish between fact and fiction. And so long as
   954	it remains possible to tell when you are "virtual" and when you
   955	are real there is no problem. We will never create V.R. so
   956	effective that it is exactly the same as real life, we will
   957	always be able to notice something unrealistic about it, perhaps
   958	the way things sound, maybe the quality of light, it would
   959	certainly be virtually impossible to convincingly eat virtual
   960	food or have a perfect sense of touch.
   961	     The most ridiculous overestimation of V.R. is that the whole
   962	world will become obsessed with V.R. and abandon the outside
   963	world forever. This is very poetic but unfortunately there are a
   964	couple little problems with this theory. Like, for example,
   965	eating. Or will V.R. be so amazing that people just won't get
   966	hungry. Oh, there is also some difficulty in respect to paying
   967	the hydro bill when you spend all of your time in V.R. and
   968	therefore have no time to work. Most people for V.R. or against
   969	V.R. tend to wildly exaggerate the importance of V.R. Remember
   970	the stories there used to be about computers? The only people who
   971	will ever be addicted to Virtual Reality already are, those are
   972	the people like Commander Rick on Prisoners of Gravity, the kind
   973	of fools who write poetry about "cyberspace."
   974	     Virtual reality does have a lot of potential; to take up
   975	where the telephone leaves off, to amuse and entertain, to
   976	design, and a whole lot more. What is annoying is to see history
   977	endlessly rehashing itself. People have always exaggerated with
   978	new inventions from film to space travel. It is ludicrous that
   979	virtual reality is treated as such a unique, modern concept. It
   980	has roots in the trend in Western culture since the Dark ages of
   981	more and more realistic art and it has roots in the production of
   982	various modern simulators. It is ridiculous the way ad agencies
   983	through around the term "interactive," in order to confuse people
   984	into associating it with virtual reality. It is ridiculous that
   985	virtual reality is being talked about this much when it probably
   986	won't take off until another half century. It is ridiculous to
   987	attribute spectacular moral consequences to virtual reality,
   988	either good or terrible. It is particularly silly to predict
   989	slaves to entertainment when no such preposterous phenomena has
   990	ever existed before. It is a field too easy to romanticize. It is
   991	easy to think of all the possibilities, and easier to forget that
   992	most of them will never be realized. Virtual reality is already a
   993	fashion statement, an advertising ploy, a moral issue, and a
   994	constant subject in magazines. With all the attention one would
   995	think we were reinventing the wheel.

  1001	             Notes on the use of the computer in art.  
  1002	             by D. Venables
  1003	
  1004	
  1005	      The computer is a tool, a fancy tool, but just a tool.  In
  1006	the hands of a person who makes art, it can be used to make
  1007	art...the REAL kind of art.  The pencil is a tool, a simple tool,
  1008	but just a tool.  In the hands of a person who makes art, it can
  1009	be used to make art...the REAL kind of art.  Perhaps if the
  1010	majority of the computer art we see is pretty dismal, it is
  1011	because the tool has not yet found the right hands.
  1012	
  1013	      Contemporary culture and the place technology has in it.  
  1014	A loaded statement.  Contemporary culture "is" technology.  At
  1015	least in our privileged neck of the woods.  Taking this course
  1016	has been akin to the experience of buying a Volkswagen and then
  1017	noticing them wherever you go.  I now see the use of computer
  1018	systems where I was once blind to them, in every facet of our
  1019	lives.  A technology this pervasive must surely be adopted by the
  1020	artists among us.  The  avant-garde will never die.  The
  1021	avant-garde will continually rear its unusual head where it's
  1022	least expected.  It is the evidence of evolution, the flower on
  1023	the plant of science.
  1024	
  1025	(Even as late as dadaism, Marcel Duchamp noticed the relation of
  1026	the avant-garde to the practice of the consumer-that the product
  1027	of the avant-garde was to have the same characteristics of
  1028	planned obsolescence/mass production as the products of mass
  1029	consumption while simultaneously allowing the producer/artist to
  1030	register shock at being reduced to a machine.)  Discussed in
  1031	Manfredo Tafuri, Architecture and Utopia: Design and Capitalist
  1032	Development (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1976).
  1033	
  1034	    Maybe notes on what art is (I guess we have to have some kind
  1035	of a definition before we can tell if computers can be a part of
  1036	it) would be in order.  A discretionary and biased viewpoint
  1037	follows.
  1038	
  1039	     After spending the last couple of years focusing entirely on
  1040	photography, I came into this course, wide-open, and ready for
  1041	new ideas, primed by a lecture by photographer Jeff Wall, who
  1042	showed a  selection of his older work and also a couple of his
  1043	new pieces, done via computer graphics.  This fired my
  1044	imagination.  Little did I know at the time that Jeff was in the
  1045	habit of traveling to Los Angeles and renting the computer lab
  1046	there in Hollywood which has all the heavy artillery used in huge
  1047	special effects productions.   The pieces he produced were of
  1048	high quality due to the level of the technology he was using,
  1049	although the work he had done could have been accomplished
  1050	through traditional photographic technique.  
  1051	
  1052	     Using "mind bicycles"  for photography is advantageous in
  1053	that the cost to the environment is considerably less, ie. the
  1054	chemicals poured down the sink (and forgotten in a frenzy of
  1055	photographic creativity)   make their way into the rivers,
  1056	oceans, air, animals and eventually back to us in some form or
  1057	another (perhaps while walking on the shore at midnight the
  1058	phosphorescence will suddenly, strangely, have you thinking of
  1059	Calvin Kline models).  The immediate health of the artist is
  1060	threatened less during computer use than during the photographic
  1061	process as well.  It is cleaner to use than almost any other art
  1062	material or tool.
  1063	
  1064	     Thinking that a two month course was plenty of time in which
  1065	to master the art of photo-manipulation, I gaily traipsed into
  1066	class to  make some art. 
  1067	
  1068	
  1069	
  1070	
  1071	DEBBIES DEFINITION OF  ART 
  1072	
  1073	    One of my definitions of  art  is, art as a verb... the act
  1074	of doing it.  After the doing part is done, what s left is a
  1075	fossil, a mere artifact of the real thing which is art.  The
  1076	art-things sitting in galleries, on walls, piled up in basements
  1077	are records and interesting as records of the metamorphosis and
  1078	working out of a thought or feeling. 
  1079	
  1080	     Art is sometimes thought of as a didactic, instructive sort
  1081	of exercise; or, conversely purely decorative.  These types of
  1082	art to me  are dead,  they leave no-where for the viewer to
  1083	exercise his or her own thought processes. 
  1084	
  1085	      The viewer is assumed to be in one of two states, with it
  1086	or not with it.  In it or out of it.  Hip or square.  If privy to
  1087	the current presumed cutting edge theme being presented by this
  1088	instructive art, the viewer can nod sagely and agree; if not
  1089	connected to the same stream of thought, there is  room for
  1090	instruction.  This is claustrophobic and limiting, it stagnates
  1091	and is retentive.  
  1092	
  1093	     At this point I have a sneaking suspicion that much of the
  1094	art making using computer technology  is of this sort, a parading
  1095	of technique, a bragging and telling how the look of reality can
  1096	be changed.  This has a tendency to dazzle and dictate a certain 
  1097	look ,  this kind of rigid template is an open invitation to the
  1098	avant-garde, the art pirates, the art-hacker.
  1099	
  1100	
  1101	 "The stimuli of the modern world, sounds and sights are
  1102	reproduced and distributed through endless systems of linear
  1103	technology.  (The more intimate senses were long ago excluded
  1104	from this order.)  Stereo and video are recorded onto tape, that
  1105	opaque blackish substance that symbolizes the intransigent,
  1106	incomprehensible linear time of this universe.  Computers and
  1107	record players use flat disks whose spiral roadways reflect the
  1108	circularity of their contents.  All visual and aural
  1109	informationspeech over the telephone, the television picture,
  1110	computer datais encoded into lines of electronic information. 
  1111	The linear becomes language.  The arcane discipline of electronic
  1112	circulation now guards the gates of the senses.
  1113	     The proliferation of the computer is the development that
  1114	most insures the closure of this system.. In the computer, we see
  1115	physically affirmed, as if by an independent source, all the
  1116	assumptions of linear thought.  Conversely, the computer ignores
  1117	all utterances not made according to the rules of its own linear
  1118	code.  With the advent of private computer use, the computer
  1119	becomes an oracle of instruction in the structures of the linear. 
  1120	It gives instruction in how t write and how to conduct
  1121	businessbut according to its own linear rules.  It is even
  1122	deployed to indoctrinate children into the ways of the linear. 
  1123	Further, as greater and greater amounts of society s information
  1124	(both financial and intellectual) are stored in computers, even
  1125	the reluctant are coerced into dealing with the computer and its
  1126	pattern of thought."

  1131	
  1132	
  1133	     Virtual reality moves art and art making into a realm of
  1134	endless possibility.  Freed from the confines of a small screen,
  1135	this new dimension, for me is so broad it is almost impossible to
  1136	speak of. Sculpture you can crawl into, ride, even travel through
  1137	for what seems like miles, interactive installations.  Perhaps
  1138	this is the new direction in art we were waiting for.  This will
  1139	influence, and enrich the traditional art practices as well as
  1140	consumerism in society--art and consumerism--a well known couple
  1141	about town.
  1142	
  1143	     The credibility of  that which is seen on a screen  (which,
  1144	to most people is accepted as the truth) can be used to
  1145	manipulate and fool the viewer.   This is not a bad thing, a
  1146	touch of healthy suspicion would be a welcome attribute in the
  1147	general public.

  1188	 interesting to communicate well, more efficient felt like we
  1189	were in touch-))
  1190	      ....huh?.....
  1191	
  1192	
  1193	
  1194	
  1195	    On a more practical note, the strongest impression I' m left
  1196	with from taking this course is the feeling of entry into the
  1197	rest of the world.
  1198	
  1199	  Especially here in Victoria, I've felt isolated, and
  1200	increasingly so the longer I m here and the more time I spend at
  1201	school.  In the past I ve always been able to take off for jaunts
  1202	into the states, around Canada or Mexico, but in the last few
  1203	years I have lead an increasingly parochial life.  It was a thing
  1204	I feared right from the first when I moved here, and then it came
  1205	true. 
  1206	I' m sure this sense of isolation is not my very own domain, 
  1207	isolation is a major theme of our society at this point and it is
  1208	my belief that technology in all its myriad forms has contributed
  1209	to this.  The ability to lead a completely vicarious life,
  1210	containing excitement beyond the potential of most people, is
  1211	available to anyone with a television, VCR, six-pack and a couple
  1212	of joints.
  1213	(oh ya, a video..fantasy of choice) 
  1214	
  1215	     This isolation is endemic.  The T.V. screen which lives in
  1216	almost every home is a constant friend, requiring no effort,
  1217	seemingly giving companionship and in reality taking away the
  1218	ability to enjoy real personal contact.  As well, a study has
  1219	shown persons who watch a  "normal"  amount of television suffer
  1220	from lack of REM sleep time, in other words, they don't dream. 
  1221	Dreaming is a necessary part of a healthy life and the loss of
  1222	this ability must have a severe, though perhaps subtle effect on
  1223	the person.  
  1224	
  1225	      In contrast with my first thoughts of the  virtual meeting
  1226	places  as making yet another barrier between people, (much like
  1227	television, probably because they re both boxes that plug into
  1228	the wall), I see them now as a link, a possible tool for fusion,
  1229	although far from perfect, especially in that it precludes a vast
  1230	amount of people from becoming part of this new community for
  1231	economic reasons.  I would like to think that with the growing
  1232	availability of the Internet, email and other network
  1233	communication systems, the unity that is created by the exchange
  1234	of thoughts and feelings will provide a humanitarian spring-board
  1235	and with the growing communication between people all over the
  1236	world (I can hear music surging in the background...I d like to
  1237	buy the world a coke...lalala) perhaps a true global
  1238	consciousness will arise.  Or the consciousness already in place
  1239	will become more compassionate through increased knowledge and
  1240	familiarity.  Art will fit in there (does already), a picture is
  1241	worth a thousand words...and takes up a lot more space...
  1242	
  1243	
  1244	     The ability to have free, almost immediate communication
  1245	with people who are far away is extremely satisfying.   
  1246	
  1247	     
  1248	
  1249	     The level playing field of electronic communication on
  1250	Internet is    seductive.  I, and most people, don't  reveal
  1251	gender, age, race, social standing while having these exchanges
  1252	and it is not necessary.  This has got to be a good thing.  
  1253	
  1254	     The  downside  of this connection is the potentially
  1255	intrusive nature of the electronic net, a net we could all be
  1256	caught in like little smelts with credit cards,  Until the end of
  1257	the World explored both these aspects fully, the connection kept
  1258	people in close contact if they so desired and made it very hard
  1259	to hide.
  1260	
  1261	     Back to my personal story.  A testimonial.  Dredged in
  1262	isolation (and I mean dredging in the culinary sense, the way
  1263	your mother used to dredge chicken pieces in flour and spices
  1264	before frying) I of course turned to the television and began one
  1265	of those marathon, epic debaucheries of avoidance.  Well, I was
  1266	dragged from my reverie of watching the passive screen to the
  1267	more engaging activity of watching the computer screen, ah....a
  1268	screen that talks back.  I m not exaggerating when I say I miss
  1269	the computer room during the weekends. 
  1270	
  1271	    For me, with my limited resources, the computer works best
  1272	for communication purposes, text, at this point is the medium of
  1273	choice.
  1274	 
  1275	    Computer art is verbal art right now.  Making traditional art
  1276	is, to me, usually a pretty solitary activity.  It is also a
  1277	physical one, I enjoy the feel of the materials, the smell, being
  1278	able to hold the art, move it around.  Because I use my senses,
  1279	it is sensual.  Because it is sensual, there is also a realm of
  1280	sexuality. The move from three dimensional art to trying to make
  1281	something that I could call art, on a screen, that I couldn t
  1282	touch or change the shape of unless I kept within the limited
  1283	dimensions, was frustrating to say the least.  Perhaps, now that
  1284	the form is not so foreign to me and I have a real desire to see
  1285	what I can do with this thing, and more time; I ll be able to
  1286	explore the visual aspects more fully.  This is only the
  1287	beginning.
  1288	
  1289	  There is no conclusion.  My world has been made larger.  I have
  1290	barely experienced an introduction to this new art tool.  I m
  1291	hooked.

  1355	
  1356	
  1357	     The last time I spent a serious duration in front of a
  1358	computer was in grade six. I was twelve years old and the
  1359	elementary school I attended had purchased four Apple II's. With
  1360	so few computers at their disposal they were forced to choose an
  1361	elite group of students who would be privileged enough have
  1362	access to the new technology. I was chosen to be among the
  1363	"lucky" ones.       
  1364	     We set out with task of learning Basic. I quickly learned
  1365	how to write a program that would spew an annoying pattern of
  1366	numbers
  1367	down the screen. I also learned how to do math equations on the  
  1368	computer, but I already had a calculator that made quick work of 
  1369	those and fit in my pocket too. We were given almost no guidance
  1370	mainly due to the fact that there was none to be given. Nobody
  1371	really knew very much about computers, with a few exceptions.
  1372	     Two young brainiacs named Adrian Evans and David Burridge
  1373	knew what they were doing. They had computers at home, the very
  1374	same ones that were at school. They wrote cute little programs
  1375	that would do this or that. Programs so inconsequential I can't
  1376	even remember them now. But they knew how to do it. They also
  1377	made it their business to remind me that I did not know what I
  1378	was doing. They would talk computer lingo and laugh at how
  1379	perplexed I would get. They would point and whisper and giggle as
  1380	I would try to explain to the teacher why I was so confused. I
  1381	had no clue why we were doing what we were doing. I was given no
  1382	assistance in that department. The "computer education" program
  1383	continued and I continued to be bewildered.
  1384	     Basically Adrian and David were geeks flaunting their
  1385	computer literacy. I knew that and I tried not to let their
  1386	intimidation get to me. It did in any case. I opted out of the
  1387	computing program. I figured they were far more trouble than they
  1388	were worth. I avoided them like the plague.
  1389	     Ten years later, I have decided to re-acquaint myself with
  1390	the machine called computer. A class called "Art and Technology:
  1391	Art  in the Age of Digital Reproduction" seemed like it would be
  1392	a good start since I already have a pretty good grasp of the art
  1393	part.  Combining art with computer technology sounded like a
  1394	fascinating progression. Since I make art, I was curious as to
  1395	how I could use computers in my art-making process. As it turns
  1396	out, the software  that is available right now is of almost no
  1397	use to me. While it can be enjoyable and amusing to manipulate
  1398	photographs and paint on electronic canvases, it still seems like
  1399	it's more trouble than it's worth. I have been told, however,
  1400	that these boxes come in handy. 
  1401	     The work that I am doing at present, which is mostly
  1402	photography, has too much basis in reality. It is about the way
  1403	we live. It is about the way we build and develop the areas where
  1404	we live and how we make those places  as ours. It is about many
  1405	aspects of being a person. I have not found a way for the
  1406	software to provide me with any assistance. I work with other
  1407	peoples' senses of self and creativity. While someone is probably
  1408	writing a program that will simulate these things, I'm not
  1409	interested. I thrive on interaction with real people, they never
  1410	cease to amaze me.
  1411	     While computer software itself has not provided me with 
  1412	inspiration, the Internet has. At first what felt like a mystical
  1413	society of computers around the globe is now a different
  1414	dimension of worldly consciousness. Quantum mechanics is busy
  1415	trying to prove the existence of alternate dimensions; I've been
  1416	exploring one for the last eight weeks. It is the dimension of
  1417	information and communication. 
  1418	     It seemed like an incredibly difficult task at first, much
  1419	like learning Basic when I was in grade six. This time however
  1420	there were no computer geeks around to hamper the learning
  1421	process. I was all on my own. With only a guide book to chart my
  1422	course I have been able to "go" all around the world. I have
  1423	gained access to a seemingly endless supply of information. Text
  1424	is definitely the most powerful medium here. I have found other
  1425	forms of information, sound and images for example, but text is
  1426	the only one that has been able to feed me satisfactorily in this
  1427	dimension. Text has given me the knowledge to explore further.
  1428	With more exploration comes more text, comes more knowledge...
  1429	This may not seem like a breakthrough discovery to most, but it
  1430	was to me. The text not only pushes me in new directions around
  1431	the Internet, it has charged my imagination. I am fascinated with
  1432	the possibilities of this new dimension. 
  1433	     I have been able to converse with people all over the world.
  1434	
  1435	The very same people I would love to interact with in person but
  1436	am unable to because of distance. Connectivity over the Net has
  1437	been the next best thing I suppose, but it is a far cry from the
  1438	real interaction that fuels my art. I have found it intriguing to
  1439	no end but it hasn't given me anything. Yet. I expect that
  1440	communication on the Internet will be very much like regular
  1441	social interactions people have nowadays. You go to places you
  1442	like. You avoid other places. You meet many people. You keep in
  1443	touch with a few. Friendships grow and you learn from each other.
  1444	The thing that has been somewhat of a shock has been the
  1445	relearning,  from scratch, of all things dealing with social
  1446	interaction. You must relearn the processes of travel and
  1447	conversation. There is no bus route for the Internet and you
  1448	can't laugh out loud.
  1449	     The arena of the MOO seems to provide a bridge between
  1450	reality and Jaron Lanier's vision of VR and communication as one.
  1451	Though they are only text-based at the moment they are headed in
  1452	the right direction. Their possibilities for character
  1453	interaction extend only as far as they can be programmed. In
  1454	addition to this, if you want to see how you interact with
  1455	another character, you must visualize it in your head. The same
  1456	goes for sounds and smells. The ideal vision of VR has all
  1457	sensory inputs virtualized. I would probably be an excellent
  1458	guinea pig for a perfectionistic VR developer. You see, I suffer
  1459	(or , as I like to think, am privileged to suffer) from a
  1460	condition I call hyper-awareness. Anything and everything my five
  1461	senses can take in they do. This  is usually a pleasing
  1462	substitute for the drugs I've never done though overloads do
  1463	happen. It can make driving a little difficult. I find the Moo's
  1464	acceptable, but not enough to tweak my senses, which enjoy
  1465	reality far too much.
  1466	     On the flipside of that argument is that Moo's, in
  1467	particular MediaMOO at MIT, have provided me with some
  1468	interesting insights into how people develop and personalize
  1469	their own space when it can be absolutely any space at all. You
  1470	can make anything and set it so it can be manipulated in any way
  1471	you choose. Most of the stuff I've "seen" has been pretty
  1472	imaginative. The major limitation of creating your own
  1473	environment in a MOO is that other characters can only perceive
  1474	it one way, the way you describe it. Something is lost when you
  1475	are not able to explore a locale with your five senses. It is
  1476	something that is not actually a sensory input. It is more of a
  1477	feeling you get about the person whose space you are in. The
  1478	sterility of the MOO keeps you from feeling this. It is pretty
  1479	difficult to get in a position in the MOO where you feel
  1480	genuinely uncomfortable. It's a feeling like this that makes you
  1481	act truly human. Without it, and others, social interaction feels
  1482	a bit too artificial. With all this talk about feeling I
  1483	beginning to think that I'm missing the point.
  1484	      If you've noticed traces of pessimism, sarcasm, and
  1485	cynicism, you're probably reading this properly. These natural
  1486	characteristics of my personality, coupled with my desire for
  1487	real experiences and my general dislike of things convenient,
  1488	leave me still wondering the same thing I wanted know in grade
  1489	six: what is all the hype about?
  1490	     It seems that almost every household has a computer. I am
  1491	constantly hearing how you must be computer literate in order to
  1492	succeed get a job nowadays. Many people are storing all their
  1493	vital information on disk. Even in this class, so many people
  1494	appear to be engrossed with learning how to use the available
  1495	software.  It seems awfully limiting. Am I missing something? Is
  1496	there something advantageous about having your job, your home,
  1497	your self, hang in the magnetic balance?
  1498	     Computer-dependant people have perhaps conveniently
  1499	forgotten that computers need electricity. Again, not a
  1500	monumental revelation, but few seem to acknowledge this fact.  It
  1501	makes me think of one of the  many power failures that used to
  1502	occur during summer rainstorms as when I was younger. People
  1503	would gather at some spot on the street, sheltered by umbrellas,
  1504	and chat. My mother once told one of the neighbour kids that
  1505	since the power h ad gone out we'd have to watch television in
  1506	the dark. He bought it. People are just as gullible when it comes
  1507	to computers. Computers also "crash" (a mysterious phenomenon
  1508	that I have been reminded of thrice during the writing if this
  1509	essay). Rarely does anybody have a solution, let alone an
  1510	explanation for this. I can't understand how people can rely so
  1511	much on such fragile pieces of equipment.
  1512	     After so much griping about these annoying boxes I'd better
  1513	reveal my admiration of them. As I have already stated, I think
  1514	the ability to communicate with them is invaluable. Having a
  1515	computer in every household for that reason alone would be worth
  1516	it. Anyone has the capability to access almost anything from
  1517	anywhere. Those are pretty huge parameters that have never been
  1518	within our reach before. People talk of a restructuring of the
  1519	Internet whereby more restrictions would be in place.
  1520	Unfortunately, due to human nature, we will probably work to
  1521	justify a situation like that. Greed will more likely than not
  1522	drive people to lock up information, with access for a price.
  1523	Hackers will continue to hack  but the stakes will be higher. The
  1524	authorities will crack down harder on those who are caught. Those
  1525	in the upper echelons of government know that information is
  1526	power, and they're not about to give it up that easily. The EFF
  1527	will hopefully grow and continue to prosper.
  1528	     I have been amazed by what computers can do. My aspirations
  1529	for putting out my own publication will be realized shortly.
  1530	While you'd never be able to tell by the appearance of this piece
  1531	of writing, I am eager to tap the dynamics of the realm of
  1532	desktop publishing. Even more than I imagined, I will be able to
  1533	distribute it world-wide if I so choose. I will be able to design
  1534	my own home, with plans ready to hand to the builders. These are
  1535	things I had not imagined possible before. I don't suppose Adrian
  1536	and David would be too impressed. So what.
  1537	     I have been feeling quite uncomfortable trying to come up
  1538	with "original insight and speculation on contemporary culture
  1539	and technology." I have such little experience with this field
  1540	that any attempts to theorize so far have ended up with
  1541	technologically aware people either stating that it's been done
  1542	or questioning why I would want do such a ridiculous thing. It
  1543	has made me feel like I'm too creative to be working on a
  1544	computer. Either that or I'm being too demanding. I don't have
  1545	the technical know-how to recognize which it is yet.
  1546	     This planet definitely needs more communication. The
  1547	Internet has made it so that you reach around the world, but not
  1548	everywhere.
  1549	As far as I know of there are no connections to the third world. 
  1550	For the most part the technology is only available to big
  1551	businesses and universities. According to Molly, a character in
  1552	MediaMOO, that would mean that this kind of technology is limited
  1553	to an elitist group of people with enough money to gain access to
  1554	the resources. The uneducated, unwashed masses are deprived of
  1555	the opportunity to be connected. I can believe it. We are going
  1556	to have to find a way to hook up the rest of the world. Without
  1557	it, the third world might slip further into the information void.
  1558	     "I have found computers provide a pretty good workout for
  1559	the modern mind. The possibilities of computing have been able to
  1560	stretch the imagination of some. Never before would you have been
  1561	able to manipulate a photograph or a rendered 3D object in the
  1562	ways you can now. You can publish yourself. While it is still
  1563	somewhat expensive to accomplish these things, it is no longer
  1564	absolute impossible. With the added potential of computers you
  1565	can let your imagination explore larger expanses. Getting things
  1566	done is now only a matter of learning how to do it, and even that
  1567	is easier than ever!"
  1568	     ...
  1569	     I still don't buy it.
  1570	     Reality is far too valuable for me to give up. I love my
  1571	cat. I love Italian food. I love my Polaroid camera. I like to
  1572	feel fear. I drive my car fast any chance I get. I have almost
  1573	drowned in snow. Standing on the edge of the roof of my apartment
  1574	gives me a rush. There is no virtual adrenalin. I play basketball
  1575	on the weekend with a bunch of very large guys who hit hard.
  1576	Bruising is an essential part of being alive.
  1577	     I have memories of growing up. Barbecues in the back yard.
  1578	Riding my bike up and down the block. Neighbours. Getting chased
  1579	by the bully. Going on vacation. Swimming at the local pool.
  1580	Stuffed animals. I don't think virtual sentiment would cut it.
  1581	The terrible feeling inside when you smoke your first cigarette.
  1582	     The experiences of my life have shaped me and will continue
  1583	to do so forever. I can't help but get the feeling that
  1584	technology is being shoved down our throats. I thought this time
  1585	I might be able to keep myself from gagging on it but i haven't
  1586	been successful so far. AT&T is trying to convince me that I
  1587	won't need a road map anymore. Their advancements will get me to
  1588	my destination quickly, safely, and efficiently, and when I get
  1589	there I can call my wife over a video-phone. They're trying to
  1590	make physical distances non-existent by transporting my presence
  1591	around through a sterilizing filter. I'll pass on it, thanks. It
  1592	all just seems too safe.
  1593	
  1594	     I have not been able to make up my mind for the last seven
  1595	pages. I have reacquainted myself with the best technology
  1596	available to me. I have explored more of the Internet than most
  1597	people I know. I have learned how to do many things with these
  1598	fancy boxes. I know what I can do. I still want to know why. At
  1599	least this time I am able to make an informed choice about my
  1600	future in computing. It is very likely that six months from now
  1601	my opinion will have changed. Nobody is going to know anyway.

  1609	INTRODUCTION
  1610	
  1611	Since the beginning of mankind, inventions were the fundamental
  1612	backbone of progression into what laid ahead.  The telephone and
  1613	television are among the most influential inventions that
  1614	propelled mankind into boundless territories.  Here,
  1615	communication is the intangible force that governs the world s
  1616	fate, we now live in.  If it wasn t for the telephone and
  1617	president Kennedy s tactics we wouldn t be here: the Cuban crisis
  1618	would have been a reality.  Now, considering this critical event
  1619	that would have seriously dictated the future of civilization,
  1620	how else will technology affect us?  Our lives will be changed
  1621	for the better or the worse by technologically advanced tools and
  1622	multimedia; in conjunction, the future of our society and culture
  1623	will adjust and adapt as we progress into what may be the 
  1624	information age  or the  post-industrial age.   A passage by Kurt
  1625	Yonnegut captures the very essence of what we are to expect with
  1626	regard to technological advancements:
  1627	
  1628	 . . . the First Industrial Revolution devalued muscle work, then
  1629	the second one devalued routine mental work. . .    
  1630	
  1631	 Do you suppose there ll be a Third Industrial Revolution? 
  1632	
  1633	 A third one? What would that be like? 
  1634	
  1635	 I don t know exactly.  The first and second ones must have been
  1636	sort of inconceivable at one time. 
  1637	
  1638	 . . . I guess the third one s been going on for some time, if
  1639	you mean thinking machines.  That would be the third revolution,
  1640	I guess - machines that devaluate human thinking. 
  1641	
  1642	(Smart, opening page)
  1643	
  1644	Although this passage makes reference to artificial intelligence,
  1645	it gives us an idea of how fast technology is progressing and the
  1646	ramifications of such progression.  Can you image  machines that
  1647	devaluate human thinking?   Our imagination would lead us to many
  1648	predictions on future society and culture.  Essentially,
  1649	technology is the impetus for the fate of our future.  In order
  1650	to instigate some thought and provide some insight, this essay
  1651	will reveal the potential capabilities of contemporary technology
  1652	and the effects it will have on modern society and culture.  
  1653	
  1654	
  1655	MODERN SOCIETY
  1656	  
  1657	Communication and information are virtually the vital blood and
  1658	heartbeat keeping society alive and healthy.  Because of
  1659	technological improvement, the way in which we communicate has
  1660	become diverse and complex (Multimedia), diverting from
  1661	conventional forms.  New technology provides capabilities to be
  1662	done differently, efficiently, and more conveniently.  In
  1663	essence, convenience and efficiency are the driving force for
  1664	modern technology, without them civilization would remain
  1665	stagnant or dormant, which ever way you look at it.  If not for
  1666	convenience, cellular phones would be obsolete and there would be
  1667	no drive for the invention of a wristwatch sized pagers.  If not
  1668	for efficiency there would be no need for software programs such
  1669	as CADs and the digital form of communication, Email. 
  1670	Convenience and efficiency complement each other, and together
  1671	are the essential ingredients for technological growth.
  1672	
  1673	With respect to the affects of technology on society,  we have
  1674	experienced what has already happened and the many researches
  1675	that had been done.  Consequently, there could be a trend that
  1676	will provide invaluable clues to the future.  Eventually we are
  1677	and will be affected by modern technology and notice changes in
  1678	our education system, government, profession, and business.  New
  1679	information and communications technologies are spreading rapidly
  1680	throughout the world at an increasing pace.  Someday, we will be
  1681	able to remain in one central location and complete all daily
  1682	tasks without coming in physical contact with another person. 
  1683	Sports and leisure activities will be the only factor motivating
  1684	the movement of our body.  People may turn into a bunch of couch
  1685	potatoes taking for granted the convenience of what technology
  1686	has to offer: already, interactive TV programs are enabling one
  1687	to order pizza from a simple command on a remote control. 
  1688	Additionally, information is as easy to access as searching for a
  1689	book in a library, may be even easier.  There are databases
  1690	everywhere that can be accessed by the public.  For example,
  1691	there is a BC computer guide listing programs and services
  1692	offered by the provincial government.  The convenience of
  1693	acquiring information by means of information highways precludes
  1694	the hassles of fiddling through a phone book and calling place
  1695	after place to access your target.  Moreover, telecommunication
  1696	is augmenting the elimination of office as the workplace.  People
  1697	will be able to conduct daily work activities without leaving the
  1698	home.  Consequently, the environment we live in may benefit from
  1699	less air pollution caused by excessive automobile exhaust and
  1700	population of the city core.  Economically, the decreased demand
  1701	for downtown office space will drive the rent/lease prices down,
  1702	thus, permitting affordable prices for people wishing to live in
  1703	the downtown area.  To conclude, there seems to be many
  1704	advantages of convenience, however, may be in the future this
  1705	world we live on will be inhabited by slothful but highly
  1706	intelligent human beings.  
  1707	
  1708	Currently, information is without question equivalent to power
  1709	that can be shared freely by all.  Some people acquire
  1710	information which is related to the struggle for the competitive
  1711	edge, especially in business.  Professions will fight for the
  1712	valuable commodity (information) that will keep them ahead of the
  1713	rest of the pact.  An academic researcher needs information to
  1714	solve problems and create theories that will undoubtedly keep
  1715	him/herself ahead of the field in his/her discipline.  Even
  1716	artists, fashion designers will be affected.  By the nature of
  1717	their industry, replication is rampant, to a certain degree, and
  1718	will burgeon if information is easily accessible.  If that s the
  1719	case artists will lose their authenticity, however, due to
  1720	serendipity and creativity, they may gain new ideas and designs
  1721	to enhance their respective disciplines.
  1722	
  1723	Presently we can access and deliver information millions of miles
  1724	away on the other side of the world.  This was unfathomable years
  1725	ago, but in the age of the INTERNET information is going to be
  1726	the blood allowing the body of society to function smoothly. 
  1727	Without this communication network we may be thrown back into the
  1728	days of civilization where mediums facilitating communication
  1729	were non-existent.  Information and communication will be so
  1730	immense that society may form into a single entity, a global
  1731	community.  Although this is a broad view there may be a
  1732	rudimentary integration of a global society.  For instance,
  1733	automatic translation of different languages for users of the
  1734	INTERNET.  A Canadian researcher communicating in English may
  1735	deliver messages instantaneously translated into Chinese for a
  1736	Chinese scientist. 
  1737	
  1738	In the INERNET era, information highways are the driving force
  1739	eliminating the need for paper as medium for communication. 
  1740	Digitized text reinforces and supports the move for a paperless
  1741	environment.  Digital text is eternal and immortal, stored in
  1742	electronic facilities, whereas paper is mortal and indefinite
  1743	with a simple force of a hand or water.  Without a doubt, the
  1744	strengths of information highways as communication mediums will
  1745	put smiles on the members and proponents of the environment
  1746	movement.  Consequently, typing will become a mandatory
  1747	prerequisite implemented in our education system.  That is until
  1748	thoughts can be entered into a computer through voice activation. 
  1749	Unfortunately (or to some - fortunately), the paperless
  1750	environment is presently not a reality and will take years for it
  1751	to become a part of society.  Despite the exponential growth of
  1752	the INTERNET and computers entering more homes,  not every man
  1753	and women has access to computers and this communication medium. 
  1754	Additionally the 100% safeguard of computer storage is not
  1755	guaranteed (because of computer viruses and the like), thus
  1756	furthering the acceptance of a paperless environment.  With
  1757	regard to mail,  the Email system will definitely flourish. 
  1758	Sending messages so easily and quickly will make writing letters
  1759	more enjoyable.  May be future post offices will integrate the
  1760	Email system in their organization.  Individual booths will have
  1761	voice or hand activated input devices that delivers any where and
  1762	place in the world at a cost comparable to a postage stamp. 
  1763	Where ever the Email system will be located, the
  1764	telecommunications industry will probably be the main and most
  1765	important industry of the future.  This industry will provide
  1766	jobs, compensating for the lost occupations that were replaced by 
  1767	computers and robotics. 
  1768	
  1769	In the education system today, computers are becoming more
  1770	prevalent.  Children are using it at a younger age, starting in
  1771	elementary schools.  By this integration of digital technology
  1772	into our schools, children might grow lacking interpersonal
  1773	skills and a social life.  This statement is generalized, but
  1774	Darwin s theory of evolution may support the truth.  As years
  1775	pass by children will lose touch of reality.  Communicating
  1776	through the INTERNET with someone without physical contact will
  1777	deprive them of the experiences and feeling from conversing with
  1778	a person face-to-face.  Additionally, the large world we live on 
  1779	will be mentally visualized as a small world, more intense than
  1780	we currently imagine.  Conversely, there are a lot of positive
  1781	outcomes from modern technology in schools.  The INTERNET will
  1782	facilitate and enhance knowledge, and provoke healthy
  1783	imagination.  If children read text sent to them through the
  1784	INTERNET, imagination will flourish as they try to grasp the
  1785	meaning of the text and the person they are communicating with.
  1786	
  1787	In medicine and academic research, information technology can be
  1788	very beneficial and advantageous.  Researchers can congregate via
  1789	computer networks (such as MediaMoo or other MUDs) facilitating
  1790	the possibilities of cures for the earth s illnesses and human
  1791	diseases.  With the use of computers and network, doctors and
  1792	researchers will be able to work together and tackle the world s
  1793	problems.  Moreover, sociologists can record, observe, and study
  1794	dialogue from players in a text form of Virtual Reality
  1795	(communication networks), allowing the fabrication of invaluable
  1796	conclusions and theories.  For biologists, computers can produce
  1797	artificial life.  Computer generated living beings live and
  1798	reproduce much like their biological counterparts.  This
  1799	breakthrough will most definitely impact further studies into
  1800	reproduction of, for example, micro organisms that are the
  1801	foundation for living forms.  Simulating biological growth can
  1802	give scientists the observational advantage without the lengthy
  1803	task of observing the real life growth stages.
  1804	 
  1805	The all too familiar human occupation loss from computer
  1806	capabilities is more pervasive as the years go by.  We have
  1807	already experienced the impact of Robotics in the work place and
  1808	due to the growth of the INTERNET and VIRTUAL REALITY computer
  1809	substitutable occupations will be diminishing.  Operators and
  1810	information servers are the unfortunate victims of this
  1811	technological take-over.  Conversely, new occupations may result
  1812	from such take-overs.  Additionally, because of advanced
  1813	softwares and artificial intelligence, modern architects (for
  1814	example) have evolved from its true origin.  Now the most
  1815	strenuous part of their job is to problem solve and design while
  1816	the once arduous task of utilizing their drafting and drawing
  1817	skills are now obsolete.  CADs and the more advanced programs
  1818	have most definitely made an impact in this industry, whether its
  1819	positive or negative.  Researcher have predicted that in the
  1820	future occupations will all be replaced or affected by computers,
  1821	except for artists, writers, and lawyers.  Well, that statement
  1822	can now be modified to ALL professions will either be replaced or
  1823	affected by technological advancements.  Artists facing digital
  1824	reproduction of their artwork may encounter appreciation in their
  1825	work, to a certain degree.  Greater exposure and dissemination of
  1826	their artwork will frankly improve advertisement of their
  1827	original work, thus creating greater demand and marketability. 
  1828	This of course is not applicable to every artwork; nevertheless,
  1829	it will impact every artist, especially the well-known or
  1830	avant-gardes of the art world.  Additionally, writers and lawyers
  1831	will inevitably be affected by the immense amount of information
  1832	floating around in the vast array of networks.  A lawyer may win
  1833	a case solely because of information he gathered as evidence that
  1834	was diligently extracted from a database in another city or
  1835	country. 
  1836	
  1837	A technological breakthrough that will literally change and rock
  1838	contemporary society is VIRTUAL REALITY (VR).  If this technology
  1839	had photo images in 3D and normal motion speed, there is
  1840	practically nothing it can t do.  Presently, among others, it is
  1841	used in medicine, military, education, training, entertainment,
  1842	and research.  The potential for VR is enormous.  While donning a
  1843	mask and wearing a sensitized glove (who knows what other
  1844	attachment will be available) one may accomplish tasks before
  1845	physically impossible.  Essentially, the use of this technology
  1846	is without limits.  One can think of many ways of concocting a
  1847	purpose or objective for VR: simulating warfare for fighter
  1848	pilots and soldiers is one assignment VR has accomplished.  The
  1849	more interesting capabilities of VR is what it will be able to
  1850	do, not what it has done.  Imagine communicating with a friend on
  1851	the other side of the world as though he/she was there in front
  1852	of you.  Images and sounds just like the  real  thing will fool
  1853	the mind and give humans the ability to do almost anything
  1854	without the presence of physical contact.  A fencer under VR will
  1855	visualize a stab wound (hypothetically speaking) without sensing
  1856	physical pain throughout his/her body.  Slam dunking like Michael
  1857	Jordan without even leaving the ground.  Unfortunately there is a
  1858	dark side to VR and that is of satisfying our minds.  It could be
  1859	addictive, comparable to psychedelic drugs that fool our minds in
  1860	accomplishing impossible feats.  The illusions of the VR may have
  1861	psychological effects that may be comparable to the
  1862	hallucinogenic narcotics available in the market.  People will
  1863	live and breath this artificial world of the VR.  The effects
  1864	could be detrimental but for its present use the VR is beneficial
  1865	to society as it trains, educates, facilitates.  Additionally, VR
  1866	can assist advertising and marketing tactics.  Business can use
  1867	this medium to introduce new products which will attract
  1868	customers, and enable penetration and acquisition of a
  1869	substantial market.  This would most definitely be a competitive
  1870	advantage for the user.
  1871	
  1872	VR may direct the future of a city s infrastructure.  For
  1873	example, VR could someday be seen in shopping malls. 
  1874	Merchandising stores will be the size of a information center
  1875	booth with VR equipment and attachments.  Inside the VR world
  1876	would be a store salesperson or assistant.  One will be able to
  1877	virtually shop inside a digitally reproduced environment of a
  1878	store.  Prior to entering this digital store, the size of ones
  1879	body will be programmed to enable one to virtually try on a piece
  1880	of desired clothing.  Then, ones appearance will be viewed in a
  1881	virtual mirror.  When one chooses to buy an item he/she will
  1882	purchase it by conventional means, and receive it where it was
  1883	stored in a compact department behind the storefront (booth).  If
  1884	VR is used along these lines, society will benefit with fewer use
  1885	for land and space.  May be the environment can be saved from
  1886	this idea (if it hasn t already been thought of).  With
  1887	increasing population, the infrastructure of a city would be
  1888	maximized to civilian comforts without building outwards,
  1889	possibly destroying the environment and pristine wilderness
  1890	areas.  Basically, land and space will be used more efficiently
  1891	and effectively, and materials would not be wasted.  
  1892	
  1893	Along with the advanced technological capabilities of VR and
  1894	other instruments, the political system may change drastically,
  1895	for the better or worse.  With the acceptance of the INTERNET in
  1896	the Clinton administration, citizens will be able to voice their
  1897	opinions, feelings, and ideas about contemporary issues and
  1898	problems.  This will enable the Clinton administration to view
  1899	the  whole  picture of a controversial issue which provides the
  1900	creation of quality decisions.  On the contrary , countries under
  1901	a fascist government will experience greater control and order by
  1902	the dictator.  With current and future information technology,
  1903	dictators will be able to monitor and record the lives of the
  1904	people.  May be George Orwell s fictitious character  Big Brother 
  1905	will become reality.  Some believe this character already exists.
  1906	
  1907	
  1908	MODERN CULTURE
  1909	
  1910	Society is built on many blocks, and no block is more celebrated
  1911	than that of culture.  Culture is what distinguishes us from
  1912	people of other nations, and because of escalating growth of
  1913	global interconnection different cultures will  be subject to
  1914	integration.  Although a lengthy process, the transition is
  1915	exemplified in the global economic system: European Economic
  1916	Community (EEC) and the imminent North American Free Trade
  1917	Agreement (NAFTA) are just  simple examples of the movement 
  1918	towards global integration (hereinafter global integration is the
  1919	cohesion of information from all the countries of the world).  In
  1920	the age where technology is fostering the construction of a
  1921	global village, how is the arts (the groundwork of culture) and
  1922	the artists going to be affected?  Currently, how have they been
  1923	affected?
  1924	
  1925	Integration of the arts, which comprise of the theatrical,
  1926	musical, and visual arts, are happening already.  Technology has
  1927	enabled people of different cultures and languages to communicate
  1928	with each other.  Words in Japanese is currently translated into
  1929	English in the matter of seconds by the tap of a finger.  Voice
  1930	activated language translation already exists, furthering the
  1931	possibilities of global integration.  Considering global
  1932	integration, what will be the dominant culture adapted by all?  
  1933	A trend that seems to be occurring rapidly gives rise to an
  1934	answer:  the country with contemporary  technology and culture
  1935	that will attract others.  An example is the youth culture in
  1936	Japan and many other Asian countries who are riding the wave of
  1937	the American youth culture.  They listen to the same music;
  1938	admire the same visual artists, musicians, actors/actresses, and
  1939	athletes; play the same sports (except for SUMO); and, eat the
  1940	same food as the Americans, all possible because of the
  1941	technological multimedia available to them.  The powerful
  1942	Americans not only influence its immediate neighbors but also
  1943	overseas countries.
  1944	
  1945	As technology develops, so does the arts.  Amid the presence of
  1946	the INTERNET, artwork will be dispersed all over the world for
  1947	viewing by anyone who possesses the necessary instruments.  As
  1948	deliverance and receipt of artwork becomes easier, the downsides
  1949	of replication (as already mentioned) are likely to be more
  1950	prevalent.  On the contrary, greater dissemination will enable
  1951	the invention of new ideas and thoughts from a compilation,
  1952	acquired through various computer networks.  A simple example is
  1953	native art.  Due to the vast amount of information available,
  1954	native artists have produced new styles and forms of art through
  1955	generations.  A native artwork is printed with colors never used
  1956	in traditional forms.  Technique and use of tools for carving
  1957	wood and metal have enhanced and elevated native artwork. 
  1958	Presently, native art is internationally recognized and cherished
  1959	by many.  The ideas may have been brought about independently,
  1960	however, the probability of acquiring new materials and
  1961	techniques from outside sources are immense.  Additionally,
  1962	contemporary artists benefit from information that can, through
  1963	human ingenuity, create new techniques, skills, and forms of art.
  1964	
  1965	
  1966	Manipulation and digital production of visual artwork provides
  1967	efficient and convenient processes of creating art.  Art
  1968	connoisseurs and enthusiasts may repudiate the nature and
  1969	originality of digitally produced artwork.  This view is
  1970	reinforced by W. Benjamin:
  1971	
  1972	 With the advent of process forms of reproduction, technique of
  1973	enlargement and slow motion begin to reveal aspects and images of
  1974	the original which escape unaided or  natural  vision.  In
  1975	addition such processes of reproduction transform the contexts of
  1976	appreciation, reception and  use  of the original through the
  1977	provision of  copies  which enter spaces and situations beyond
  1978	the reach of the original.   (Smart, p.112)
  1979	
  1980	Additionally, he argues that  such developments have interfered
  1981	with the 
  1982	 authenticity  of the object and that  in the age of mechanical
  1983	reproduction. . . . the aura of the work of art withers.  (Smart,
  1984	p.112).  Nevertheless, the few that may support this view must
  1985	realize the evolution of the mediums of visual communication. 
  1986	Art was produced and expressed on wood and stone in the days of
  1987	the Neanderthal and Cro-magnon man; then, artwork was expressed
  1988	on paper; consequently, photography replaced the artistic
  1989	functions of the hand; currently, artistic expression is found on
  1990	the computer screen.  If one accepts this view, digitally
  1991	contrived artwork will be considered an authentic and unique form
  1992	of art. 
  1993	
  1994	Amid the controversies on the amalgamation of artwork and
  1995	technology, artists (the creators and founders of cultural
  1996	characteristics) face extinction (in reality --- layoffs or fewer
  1997	jobs).  With the softwares (i.e. MacDraw) available in the
  1998	market, artists are overwhelmed by the capabilities and functions
  1999	of computer assisted production of design and music.  The
  2000	efficiency of these software packages are creating the
  2001	elimination of artist and their conventional skills and
  2002	techniques.  Artists of the 90s and the future will probably need
  2003	computer literacy and utilization techniques as replacement for
  2004	their original skills (of using chalk, paint, pen, etc.).  If
  2005	this is the case, who is the real/true artist the computer or
  2006	person?  In light of what may happen to artists,  art may be
  2007	negatively affected by mass production and dissemination.  A
  2008	piece of artwork may devalue in the mind of a viewer because of
  2009	overexposure.  Much like the people who get sick and tired of the
  2010	same music played on a particular radio station: our minds simply
  2011	turn off when their is repetition.  By the year 2010, the term 
  2012	original piece of artwork  may signify the  original  millionth 
  2013	piece of artwork.

  2016	CONCLUSION
  2017	
  2018	Currently the effects of technology is apparent to all of us;
  2019	however, in the age where full-blown cyberculture is not far off
  2020	in the future, we face a great deal of uncertainty and
  2021	vulnerability from what technology will offer.  We could be
  2022	living beings existing mentally only in a digital environment
  2023	(i.e. in a MediaMoo).  More frightening, we are unsure about the
  2024	actual capabilities of technology in the future.  Imagine what it
  2025	would be like to live on a world where communication is
  2026	accomplished through wires connected to the brains of
  2027	participating individuals from a central computing unit.  Wim
  2028	Wender s film,  Until The End of the World  gave us a visual
  2029	interpretation of the physical instruments necessary for entering
  2030	digital information directly into the human brain; this would
  2031	enable the phenomenon of telepathy into a virtual reality.  The
  2032	use for this fictitious instrument would be endless (e.g.
  2033	eyesight for the blind) and the consequences would  probably turn
  2034	contemporary society and culture five hundred and forty degrees. 
  2035	Additionally, it would either astonish or  scare the shit out of
  2036	modern man and woman.   
  2037	
  2038	We can predict the ramification of technology on the future of
  2039	our society and culture, however, those prediction will never be
  2040	known to actually occur.  Our future is like a biological entity,
  2041	no empirical data or past trends can forecast what is the fate of
  2042	mankind.  Not only do we as individuals live,  so does the
  2043	society and culture.  We are the blood cells that circulate
  2044	through the veins of society and culture.  Technology is the
  2045	medicine or illness that will permeate the body of society and
  2046	culture.  The effects will not truly be known until the blood
  2047	cells (people) accept the medication (technology) or reject the
  2048	illness (technology).  Currently, the capabilities of  medication
  2049	(e.g. LSD in the 60s) and illness (AIDS in the 90s) are without
  2050	boundaries.  Analogous to technology, the mind altering drug of
  2051	LSD and the killer disease of AIDS are flourishing, capable of
  2052	influencing the fate of the mankind.  If technology didn t
  2053	progress, history would not exist and time would not advance into
  2054	the next minute or day.  The stagnant environment would not yield
  2055	any unusual events or occurrences.  However, reality is the
  2056	advancement of time and technology.  The future effects of
  2057	technology on society and culture will never be know, but we can
  2058	only theorize, visualize, and imagine.

  2073	  TECHNOLOGY
  2074	     
  2075	     
  2076	     The effects of modern technology on contempory culture and
  2077	society are far-reaching and have irrevocably changed the way in
  2078	which we view ourselves, and the world around us.  Technology has
  2079	profoundly affected us psychologically, socially, physically, and
  2080	emotionally.  It has influenced the way in which we interact with
  2081	each other and with computers, and has drastically changed the
  2082	way in which we continue to develop.  Gradually, we have come to
  2083	see the world as an entire global community that is linked
  2084	through computers and other communication systems.  Because of
  2085	technological advances it is now as easy to exchange ideas with
  2086	someone in China as it is with the person next door.  Advances
  2087	have also been made in the computer programs that deal
  2088	specifically with visual art and design.  One can also see the
  2089	advances made in fields like Cybernetics, Virtual reality, and
  2090	artificial intelligence.  Yet these advances are not without
  2091	drawbacks; for, the human factor tends to be left out of the
  2092	equation and makes information exchange impersonal and isolating. 
  2093	The technological progression that has occurred in the last one
  2094	hundred years has far outstripped the advances made in the
  2095	previous one thousand years and with each new development
  2096	hundreds of possibilities arise for further advancement.
  2097	
  2098	     The technological breakthroughs made in the last twenty
  2099	years have affected us immeasurably.  Within the framework of
  2100	communication systems alone, the socialization of humankind is
  2101	irrevocally changed.  We no longer see borders between nations as
  2102	psychological deterrents; merely as physical barriers.  We can
  2103	communicate with people in other nations as easily as we do with
  2104	those we find within our own circle.  Entire databases and
  2105	networks have been set up to encourage communication and
  2106	information exchange between a diverse range of participants.
  2107	Telnet, Gopher, Mail Art, and Internet are just a few examples of
  2108	services developed to promote and expand the concept of
  2109	individual expression and facilitate the access to a vast array
  2110	of information available in the computer age. 
  2111	     
  2112	     Computer networking is one of the fasted growing
  2113	opportunities in the computer field.  It allows for a vast array
  2114	of different information to be accessed immediately at one's
  2115	fingertips,  Telnet alone has over 4 000 different topics ranging
  2116	from weather and travel information to science and politics . 
  2117	Once hooked up to the network, the user can access different
  2118	"conferences" and can send and receive electronic mail.  While
  2119	using Telnet, I was able to access very diverse material, and
  2120	receive information on architecture and design, as well as
  2121	"conferenced" with a company that is sponsoring a design student
  2122	exchange between different Universities.  The quantity and
  2123	variety of information that can be accessed is amazing, and it is 
  2124	growing yearly as more and more people and companies connect to
  2125	networks.
  2126	     
  2127	     Over and above of dealing strictly with information
  2128	exchange, networks also exist to expose artwork and other
  2129	creative fields to the general public.  The International Network
  2130	Culture endeavors to eliminate the divisions between viewers and
  2131	participant, and artists and non-artists, while providing the
  2132	structure for ongoing global artistic interaction.  Socially
  2133	speaking, it has linked a variety of people,(students, teachers,
  2134	professional artists, etc.) who come from different locations and
  2135	sociological backgrounds, who otherwise would never have
  2136	interacted.  This type of networking culture is a new movement
  2137	which challenges the conventional meanings of art and literary
  2138	expression and acknowledges art to be more interactive.  The
  2139	intrinsic value of this democratic system of personal expression
  2140	allows for individuals to concentrate on aesthetic and creative
  2141	concerns and not on status or political concerns.      
  2142	     
  2143	     Cyberspace is a computer generated space that humans can
  2144	enter and interact within.  Cyberart, created in cyberspace,
  2145	therefore has no physicality like real art, and it is more
  2146	democratic in the sense that it is created and expressed on a
  2147	unilateral and not on a hierarchical level.  Because it is new
  2148	there is no hard and fast rule defining cyberspace.  As more and
  2149	more people get on-line to networks and bulletin boards, the
  2150	governing of  cyberspace--who will be allowed access to what and
  2151	where and for what cost are questions that will need answers. 
  2152	The majority feel that the broader the base of a non-hierarchical
  2153	self-governing body, the more it would adhere to the premise
  2154	behind cyberspace; namely, individual rights and equal access. 
  2155	However, it is all a question of logistics, control, and money. 
  2156	Because there are millions of people who are on-line to networks,
  2157	there is a great deal of money at stake and the question is who
  2158	(what companies) will have a monopoly on the service. As services
  2159	continue to develop one must also look at expansion in a
  2160	direction that favours two-way networking which favours a more
  2161	democratic decentralized system.  This decentralization can also
  2162	be seen in today's computer companies.  With the expansion of a
  2163	more global market, companies are now specializing in specific
  2164	areas.  This also allows for competion among groups dealing in
  2165	specific arenas which in turn enables the consumer a wider
  2166	variety of choices.
  2167	     
  2168	     A new network being developed that has a great potential and
  2169	will offer many benefits is ISDN., Integrated Services Digital
  2170	Network.  It is a set of digital protocols which enables the
  2171	movement of information, both voice and video, over regular
  2172	telephone wires at a faster speed than can be achieved by a
  2173	modem.  The possibilities could include video conferencing  and
  2174	electronic mail, and other  information to be transferred from
  2175	home, and portable sites that as of yet are not as accessible as
  2176	the office environment. This type of infrastructure will allow
  2177	for greater flexibility and freedom of where and when information
  2178	can be sent and received at very rapid rate. As of yet, ISDN is
  2179	not readily available, but alliances are forming between computer
  2180	and phone companies in order to establish the groundwork for
  2181	local, national, and international access-- in essence, to
  2182	establish a "information super-highway".  
  2183	     
  2184	     The way in which computers have become integrated into our
  2185	daily life has made us become more and more dependent on them. 
  2186	The psychological and emotional impact of the "computer age"  has
  2187	been far-reaching  and has challenged the way in which we view
  2188	the world.  One of the main psychological concerns caused by the
  2189	increasing role that computers play in our lives is Fear.
  2190	
  2191	
  2192	     "The real danger is not that
  2193	     computers will begin to think
  2194	     like men, but that men will
  2195	     begin to think like computers"
  2196	     -Sydney J. Harris
  2197	
  2198	     According to a report in "Omni" magazine, computer
  2199	scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  stated
  2200	"....we are rapidly losing, have perhaps already lost, physical
  2201	and mental control of our society." (According to Dr. Joseph
  2202	Weizenbaum).  Generally, the level of fear is most prevalent
  2203	among older people, because the younger generation have become
  2204	familiar with computer skills and programming.  These are being
  2205	intergrated into the educational system.  Yet, "computerphobia"
  2206	persists to be a major stumbling block in the path of technology. 
  2207	There are a various rationalizations behind this fear; some
  2208	people are afraid of losing jobs, as more and more complex
  2209	machines are being developed that can do the work cheaper and
  2210	more efficiently.  Others become overwhelmed and feel
  2211	insignificant and view the entire computer field as
  2212	incomprehensible and threatening.  There is such an overpowering
  2213	array of different computers, programs, information, plug-ins,
  2214	printers, etc., available, that it is hard to even begin to
  2215	understand were to begin, let alone become proficient in the
  2216	computer age.  However the most compelling fear we face is that
  2217	computers will become too powerful and man will no longer be in
  2218	control.  This general idea is even played out in major Hollywood
  2219	movies i.e. "The Terminator".
  2220	                    
  2221	    "Modern man is the victim of the very instruments he values
  2222	most.
  2223	     Every gain in power, every mastery of natural forces, every
  2224	     scientific addition to knowledge has proved potentially
  2225	dangerous,
  2226	      because it has not been accompanied by equal gains in self
  2227	     understanding and self discipline.
  2228	          -Lewis Mumford
  2229	                
  2230	     Modern technology also has a physical impact on our lives. 
  2231	In light of the fact that now millions of people sit in front of
  2232	a computer terminal for hours at a time day after day,
  2233	regulations have been passed limiting the amount of time a person
  2234	can sit in front of a screen without a break.  There is an
  2235	increased awareness of the effects of electromagnetic  fields
  2236	that are given off from monitors and are strongest within two
  2237	feet of the monitor.  To date there has not been a comprehensive
  2238	long-term study of the physical ramifications of the field. 
  2239	There are also studies that indicate that there are increased
  2240	cancer rates for people regularly exposed to radiation and an
  2241	increased rate of miscarriages.(Brodeur, Paul, Currents of Death:
  2242	power lines, computer terminals, and the attempt to cober up
  2243	their threat to your health)    Luckily, there is an increased
  2244	awareness and new advances in monitor design that help shield the
  2245	user from excess radiation.  Other physical problems that occur
  2246	with the computer are dizziness, headaches, and eyestrain.  These
  2247	are caused by flickering or unclear screens or by glare, yet
  2248	these too can be relieved by using antiglare screens and proper
  2249	lighting.  A lesser known physical problem is known as repetitive
  2250	stress injury; found when one does the same thing over and over
  2251	again.  This can have a damaging effect on various parts of the
  2252	body.  Lower back pain can be relieved by getting up and changing
  2253	positions frequently.  Another common ailment is pain in the
  2254	wrists, hands and arms; variations on keyboard design and
  2255	placement are being reviewed but no solution has yet been found
  2256	that completely relieves the problem..
  2257	     
  2258	      With the advent of video cameras, computer imaging, and
  2259	desktop publishing, etc, we can "immortalize" ourselves, our
  2260	actions, and our thoughts.  Psychologically, this has had a great
  2261	impact on they way we perceive our limitations as human beings.
  2262	Now, we are no longer even limited to reality as we know it. With
  2263	the recent explosion in the direction of  Virtual reality,
  2264	technology has taken us into a field never before explored. 
  2265	Virtual reality will have many applications and uses in the years
  2266	to come.  The technology allows the user to move through
  2267	computer-generated images (with the use of a helmet) in a three
  2268	dimensional world, which is super-imposed on the "real world". 
  2269	For example one could be a mountain climber or become the main
  2270	character in a video game.   Designers of  Virtual reality
  2271	software are also working on programs that will make television
  2272	an interactive and not just a passive activity.  While, the
  2273	equipment is still not as refined as programmers' wish, the
  2274	advances in technology have been amazing.  Virtual reality will
  2275	have many other applications as well as belonging to recreational
  2276	arenas.  It will be a great educational tool that will be seen in
  2277	operating rooms  and in many types of very specialized
  2278	simulations.  By the end of this century,  the field of Virtual
  2279	reality will be so diverse and will open up avenues, as yet
  2280	unheard of.
  2281	     
  2282	     Cybernetics: (neural modelling) the science of control and
  2283	communications systems founded on the theory that intelligent
  2284	beings adapt to their environments and accomplish goals by
  2285	reacting to feedback from their surroundings.  The premise behind
  2286	cybernetics is based on human neural networks, the fact that one
  2287	can learn, generalize, and hypothesize.  The objective is to
  2288	create self-organizing machines, ones that can adapt and learn.
  2289	However, the difference in capabilities between biological
  2290	information-processing systems and computers remains extensive. 
  2291	In biological networks, it is through innate properties and
  2292	through learning that humans are able to respond to specific
  2293	stimuli.  In effect, each individual neuron is its own decision
  2294	maker and memory storer.  The one great advantage we have over
  2295	any artificial intelligence is our resilience, damage caused to a
  2296	few neurons will not shut down our entire memory or
  2297	information-processing mechanism.  With an artificial system,
  2298	memory is stored with an arbitrary numerical address and can only
  2299	be accessed as such.  Humans on the other hand have the ability
  2300	to retrieve memories through various methods, including  content
  2301	association.  The dream to achieve machine intelligence that is
  2302	parallel or greater than humankind still lies in the very distant
  2303	future;  in the meantime, the complexity and  versatility of 
  2304	computer programs continue to develop rapidly.
  2305	     
  2306	     With the complexity of computers increasing exponentially,
  2307	the question arises: "Can artificial life be alive?"  The
  2308	semantics of the sentence alone is question enough,  yet is there
  2309	an answer?  Thomas Ray is a biologist at the University of
  2310	Delaware.  Three years ago, he started testing a model of
  2311	evolutionary principles created on a computer.  He designed a
  2312	system called Tierra, which illustrated that evolution works just
  2313	as well in a computer system as in the real world.  He created a
  2314	digital creature made up of a string of computer instructions
  2315	which he then introduced into the model.  Within hours the single
  2316	creature proliferated, created a race of clones that lived,
  2317	evolved, and died and themselves spawned new groups of mutants. 
  2318	Ray and other scientists believe that some electronic creatures
  2319	are more than imitating life, that they actually are alive.  
  2320	     
  2321	     In the past decade, there has been a proliferation of
  2322	scientists working on computers who have produced systems with
  2323	digital creations that resemble plants and insects in a silicon
  2324	world.  There is very little agreement among scientists about
  2325	what can be deemed alive, still many want to create what will
  2326	qualify as life forms.  The Chaos Theory  is an assumption that
  2327	computer-generated systems might  actually mirror nature because
  2328	scientists have discovered that patterns and structures can even
  2329	be discerned in systems that appear to be totally disordered.  It
  2330	is through the creation of  artificial life  that researchers
  2331	hope to discover "what is it in matter that enables it to have
  2332	such an innumerable variety of forms, including life"(Steen
  2333	Rasmussen, a Danish Physicist working at the Santa Fe Institute)
  2334	     
  2335	      The effect that advances in technology has had on art in
  2336	today's society is far-reaching and has irrevocably changed the
  2337	way in which think about visual art.  In the last century, the
  2338	transformation that has occurred in the visual art world is
  2339	immeasurable. Western society no longer necessitates that art
  2340	must fit into the well defined category assigned to it years ago. 
  2341	It does not have to be a framed painting,  a piece of
  2342	representational sculpture, or a well presented piece of work. 
  2343	Visual  art is what the artist creates, whether it be a be on
  2344	paper or on a computer.  The progress made to computer programs
  2345	and applications which enable artists to create a variety of
  2346	effects is astounding.  New methods and techniques arise daily as
  2347	more and more people are experimenting with the plethora of
  2348	results that can be achieved with computer programs like
  2349	Photoshop, Superpaint, and Autocad.  The advances made in
  2350	programs that relate to the realm of graphic design and
  2351	architectural design have transformed those fields irrevocally. 
  2352	As an Interior Design student I have noted what computer programs
  2353	like Autocad and Minicad are doing to the design field,  even the
  2354	way in which programs like Architecture and Interior Design are
  2355	being taught are affected.  The basic drafting skills are still
  2356	required, yet curriculums are now being augmented with courses
  2357	dealing with computer-aided design.  The field of  graphic design
  2358	is also changing rapidly.  The majority of advertisement, logos,
  2359	letterheads and all types of signage are now all being produced
  2360	on computers.  It is not only the design fields themselves that
  2361	are affected by this new technology; western society's views on
  2362	what visual art is  have changed. 
  2363	     
  2364	     Today, anyone who has a computer and a simple drawing
  2365	program can now create visual art.  Visual art is no longer
  2366	regulated to "artists"  as it was in the days of the Beaux Art. 
  2367	There are no longer clear rules deciding what is classified as
  2368	art and what is not.  Who says that what one produces on a
  2369	computer program is any less artistic than what one creates with
  2370	pen and paper.  When the field of photography was first developed
  2371	there was a lot of complaints and concerns dealing with whether
  2372	it should be considered and artistic field or not.  There were
  2373	many painters who had trained for years to be able to replicate a
  2374	tree realistically on canvas  who were dismayed at the idea that
  2375	photography was to be taken seriously as an art form.  Yet with
  2376	time, as the consternation of a new and unknown field wore of f,
  2377	society came to accept photography as a  legitimate artistic
  2378	statement of its own, and learned to value it accordingly.  It is
  2379	also so with computer-generated visual art.  
  2380	     
  2381	     People will become aware and learn to appreciate the quality
  2382	and caliber of  the work being produced.  A further benefit of
  2383	the advances made in computer design programs is the ability for
  2384	society as a whole to be able to create and contribute to the
  2385	field of visual art.  Due to the great accessibility of design
  2386	and drawing programs, anyone with a home computer will be able to
  2387	produce an array of drawings, graphically altered images, and
  2388	architectural drawings. 
  2389	     
  2390	     The effects of modern technology on society and contemporary
  2391	culture are phenomenal and immeasurable.  They have altered the
  2392	way in which we view ourselves, and the changing world around us. 
  2393	They have touched our psychological, social, and physical lives
  2394	and have greatly modified they way in which we develop.  With the
  2395	unprecedented advances made in computerized communication systems
  2396	and networks even the way in which we interact with one another
  2397	and with computers is different than it was twenty years ago.  
  2398	The world is now linked electronically and we have become one
  2399	giant global community.  Technological advances have also
  2400	affected the fields of Cybernetics, Virtual Reality, artificial
  2401	life, and computer design programs.  The transformation that can
  2402	be seen in the Art world is astronomical and has irrevocally
  2403	changed the way in which society views and values visual art.  
  2404	The technological progression over the last hundred years have
  2405	been phenomenal and with each new technical discovery countless
  2406	possibilities arise for further advancement.

  2412	Contemporary Culture (& Technology): 
  2413	An Example of it More Than Anything Else
  2414	
  2415	
  2416	By R.K. Shaw                                                   
  2417	June, 1993.
  2418	
  2419	
  2420	     It`s funny how we`re living in the past so much of the time. 
  2421	The present, for me, has not just one finite meaning.  We all
  2422	have different presents wrapped up within what we know of our own
  2423	culture and how much we partake in it and so much more.
  2424	     And how about the Volkssport Association of British Columbia
  2425	display and beer garden down here at Market Square.  I don`t know
  2426	what this is about beyond an accordion player in tall socks, a
  2427	pixie hat, and suspenders for his shorts. Or are those knickers?
  2428	     I think they`re into hiking - them Volkenssporters.  Come
  2429	from the Alps originally perhaps.  Today they`ve got the centre
  2430	of attention, although I feel i`ve come after the peak of the
  2431	party.  But maybe not at all.  For an afternoon party it`s pretty
  2432	much come and go as you please.  To PARTY does not seem to be the
  2433	big focus of the, the event?  Is that what it`s called?  My
  2434	shoulder`s sore & the sun is reflecting in my eyes.  I think
  2435	Volkenssportees are in the blue shirts.  Older they are than me
  2436	or, well me anyways.  Oh, they`re some burgundy shirts as well. 
  2437	A 10 & 20km walk was just announced for tomorrow (a way of
  2438	achieving visionary state of mind through walking? - an ancient
  2439	tradition?) and a walking tour of Market Square, Fantan Alley,
  2440	and Chinatown - but no points allowed for that one.  Eleanor
  2441	Grant from Comox is now going up to receive a certificated for
  2442	13,000 km.  John Grady has done 25 marathons and over 25,000 km
  2443	in 19 years.  
  2444	Margy Limpy of Victoria,
  2445	Jerry Levine of Victoria,
  2446	and a few others.
  2447	Check out all the sun hats on the beer garden tables.
  2448	CLap Clap Clap
  2449	OH, Cathy Lean is there from Kelona, Washington.
  2450	And hey, how does anyone become an ambulence attendant anyways?
  2451	     Actually that`s not that difficult a question to answer. 
  2452	Either is grave diggers I suppose.  Don`t beer gardens usually
  2453	have low fences around their parametres, you know, just to keep
  2454	in & keep out or what ever - FENCES, as I would say when Mike and
  2455	I discovered that Mini had pood in the tub. "Well you know cats,
  2456	CATS."  All about cats explained in one word.
  2457	     I guess he`s playing polkas.  That`s a polka right? 
  2458	Accordion equals Polka.  Easy music.  
  2459	
  2460	
  2461	SO,
  2462	     About what I was going to tie this all into.  Well just look
  2463	around - oh sorry, one more little divergence for a sec, it looks
  2464	like the Volkies are sponsored by Rockport.  Walkers they are,
  2465	cool.
  2466	So yes, I just came from a bookstore where I flipped through a
  2467	sort of compilation sci.fi. comic
  2468	     Whoa,one more Volky comment - He`s up  holding the Canadian
  2469	flag - not a bad size one either -  & what,      come on,   is
  2470	that it? -  I`m waiting for him to at least flex his muscles but
  2471	yes no the flag  is now back in its place on stage.  Beer
  2472	gardens.
  2473	
  2474	     And above the Guatemalan shop and over to the left one can
  2475	buy all the latest, freshest clothing.  Rave wear & sort of skate
  2476	shit.  That whole alternative to norm transition and all of its
  2477	labels    shit...
  2478	"To all the girls I`ve loved before".  Hey this guy must be good,
  2479	give him a digital delay sampler on his acorn and I`d listen
  2480	longer & around & around but for now I`ve got to go.  When the
  2481	saturation point comes...
  2482	
  2483	
  2484	a few days later...
  2485	
  2486	     I`m not always explicit and obvious with what I  mean
  2487	because  my meaning is, in a way, your meaning.  You construct it
  2488	from that I throw together.  This makes communication more
  2489	interesting and interactive.  Although according to some trains
  2490	of thought, more linear ones perhaps, this way of communicating
  2491	isn`t plausible on an academic or definitive level.  What i`m
  2492	talking about is taking place in a more creative or lucid
  2493	context.  Often, making THINGS interesting is part of what
  2494	everything we construct is about.  We are here, alive, so why not
  2495	think about stuff & talk about stuff & write about stuff and do
  2496	it and make it interesting while we`re here.  Enlightenment is
  2497	boring, so balanced and harmonious and uninteresting.  There you
  2498	have it, the answer to IT all.  So now what, you`re alive, what
  2499	else is new.  Just keep on living & working or what ever I
  2500	suppose.  N`est-ce pas?  And change too I guess.  Throw that in
  2501	there as well.  Change (or not) comes from growth or rather can
  2502	be growth, and if you like expanding (your mind and being lets
  2503	say) you learn form experiences and as a result change (or not)
  2504	because of them.  You becomes a better, or rather, a different
  2505	person than you were from the last minute
  2506	                                                            or
  2507	half hour

  2532	
  2533	
  2534	
  2535	Cause as they say...
  2536	     
  2537	
  2538	
  2539	
  2540	
  2541	
  2542	
  2543	
  2544	
  2545	
  2546	
  2547	
  2548	
  2549	
  2550	
  2551	
  2552	
  2553	
  2554	     So ypoorter was writing this thing she calls Everything Is
  2555	Fuct and I was thinking ya,
  2556	
  2557	
  2558	               everything is fuct.
  2559	
  2560	
  2561	
  2562	
  2563	
  2564	
  2565	
  2566	
  2567	
  2568	
  2569	
  2570	
  2571	                       So?
  2572	
  2573	
  2574	Everything is fuct and nothing is fuct and everything is fuct. 
  2575	But that`s what she was writing about, at least that`s what I
  2576	think.  And I`m an authority, because I say so.  I could say why
  2577	I'm an authority but I`ll talk about later.
  2578	     
  2579	     Now is later. Ha! How do you like that - quicker than a
  2580	polaroid, faster (perhaps) than money, more satisfying than -
  2581	well you might just not care so anyways->
  2582	
  2583	AUTHORITY: Who gets it, how, about what, & why.
  2584	
  2585	I guess what bugs me most about authority is when it`s used
  2586	oppressively or down right for the negative - Negatively. 
  2587	Authority, or knowledge (or not), can be used so, so productively
  2588	(?) (I`ll use that word rather than positively, as, i guess my
  2589	presuppositions are cropping up & in here - but hey, of course). 
  2590	     NOTE:  My little positive/productive debate thang comes out
  2591	of this                  thought being relative to my own biases
  2592	and presuppositions preferences.  They  would be for, as I would
  2593	place them, on the positive, caring                         side
  2594	(interpret that as you wish, I do too). 
  2595	Yet instead of being used to foster love, self realization and
  2596	empowerment for the benefit of yourself and other beings and
  2597	rocks or trees, authority could just as easily be used to
  2598	encourage and promote hate and self realization and self
  2599	empowerment for the benefit of other beings etc as well (although
  2600	probably for the benefit of others who look most like whoever`s
  2601	doing the talking.
  2602	I seem to be getting sidetracked (something which I like) a bit
  2603	too much perhaps.  Or maybe there is just so much I want to say
  2604	that I get on to something else before I clearly and neatly
  2605	finish up with what I oh what ever.  An outline and maybe some
  2606	more formal structure to this speel would make it more acceptable
  2607	on a standard essay format.  But this is supposed to be informal
  2608	so I guess I`ll go with it.  This paper/piece/essay is about what
  2609	I want to say and how I want to say it.  It is also suppose to be
  2610	about contemporary culture and technology.  The two, me and
  2611	contempo cult & tech, are bound in ways that I may or may not
  2612	talk about but probably will.   Ok, so I guess I`m overwhelmed. 
  2613	La tee da tee da.  There are just a couple more things that I
  2614	wanted to mention.  There was a snowboard add from a couple of
  2615	years ago that went something like this: "Don`t question
  2616	authority, ignore it."  To further that I like: "Don`t question
  2617	authority, be it." I sort of got that from what Mr. Virtual
  2618	Reality, Jaron Lanier, was saying about Big Brother types
  2619	possibly wanting to control V.R. input like tapping a phone line. 
  2620	He advocated becoming smarter or a better hacker than those who
  2621	try to "control" things. Sorry Jaron if that's not quite what you
  2622	were getting at but it is what I mean and well, meaning is
  2623	obscure isn`t it?   
  2624	
  2625	     I could say "that`s it" but no.  Shall we continue?
  2626	I`ve very recently come to realize that I`m writing about the
  2627	future, and the very near past.  I`m not used to doing this, or
  2628	at least used to looking at creativity in such a way.  Normally
  2629	when ever I write it is not about things which are as of yet
  2630	undefined.  This means that I am writing about nothing which is
  2631	now becoming something.  This is just how technologies and
  2632	cultural movements are continually emerging, evolving, and being
  2633	defined.  I can write about what is now happening in my world, as
  2634	far as I know, and what I am doing within it, as a part of it so
  2635	to speak.  Often the more one knows the more one can partake. 
  2636	But not always.  For example, I can partake with what I know, but
  2637	of course not everywhere, well yes everywhere.  My degree of
  2638	involvement is restricted or modulated by my ability to, so to
  2639	speak, speak the language.  Or for others their ability to speak
  2640	my language.  We are always partaking in our society to one
  2641	degree or another.  By choosing not to partake you are partaking. 
  2642	
  2643	     NOTE: I use "you" instead of "one" sometimes (lots) because
  2644	even though         it`s bad grammar I think it more directly
  2645	addresses you, the reader. Active inactivity.  Or inactive
  2646	inactivity.  Or even inactive activity.  Defining.  That`s it! 
  2647	I`m talking about who is defining what is what.  Which all ties
  2648	into authority.  Got it?  I sure do and don`t.  But even that is
  2649	what I`m talking about.  This might help:  
  2650	          
  2651	Music, group, & get together.  Well like                         
  2652	                                                                 
  2653	                                                     that`s
  2654	another thing but you know.  Cause                               
  2655	                                                                 
  2656	     you know music is music.  If you want to                    
  2657	                                                                 
  2658	               play music you can play music if you have         
  2659	                                                                 
  2660	                         the people you want to play music with
  2661	then 
  2662	you can play music.  Know what I mean?
  2663	               -Bob Marley from Talkin` Blues.
  2664	
  2665	     There is an active movement or cultural shift in importance
  2666	that is growing, or at least trying to.  One with an enfaces on
  2667	the security of living as an individual, living with others how
  2668	you want to with respect and appreciation from those who surround
  2669	you.  This can be a scary thought because I don`t want somebody
  2670	doing what they want if it means bad stuff.  "Bad stuff" covers
  2671	alot and is culturally and personally specific.  What I might
  2672	consider bad would of course be good to somebody else and even my
  2673	thoughts right here are culturally specific to some one who
  2674	chooses to live in a smooth transition, positive vibe, caring,
  2675	try to not be afraid to speak my mind but get along with other
  2676	people and things kind of way.  I may have to rewrite that
  2677	sentence.  So, because of the randomness of truth and meaning,
  2678	people may conflict and hey, why not allow for that?  How?  Well
  2679	I could talk a lot about that but it would just be me spouting
  2680	what I believe in and all of a sudden I feel strange about doing
  2681	that.  But since that`s what i`m doing anyways, heck, why not?  I
  2682	still feel kind of strange because I`m not used to saying what I
  2683	believe in to a potentially large (hello out there) audience.  So
  2684	if i`m going to speak to YOU which includes all of you (ha) then
  2685	here we go.  
  2686	
  2687	     ME as pointer outer for a yet undefined cultural standpoint. 
  2688	I don`t know how far it reaches.  By this I mean that it might
  2689	just reflect back at me, or my friends, or my ecological region,
  2690	or country, age group, or race, or sexual orientation, or
  2691	economic bracket, or gender, or hair length, or level of formal
  2692	education, or experience, or yes so many of these things go in to
  2693	where I`m coming from but I know that already and acknowledge it. 
  2694	Maybe our lack of a definition or label is what defines us.  An
  2695	aware Slacker or active GenXer would be the closest term perhaps
  2696	(more about this later).  People sometimes go through something
  2697	like this on a personal level but I`d like to see it happen on a
  2698	massive cultural scale. And I do, and don`t.  It comes and goes. 
  2699	One vibe becomes more prominent than another.  Which is fine. 
  2700	That is change, allow for it and you might not become bitter. 
  2701	Remember that sometimes these thing work in cycles.  I`m relying
  2702	on myself and on others of some what like mind to live daily in
  2703	such a way.  I just read an Alice Walker book.  "Resistance is
  2704	the secret of joy" it said.  I am holding out you might say,
  2705	hanging on to my own terms, letting them change and adapt, but
  2706	trying to live life my way.  Reminds me of an old Lover Boy song. 
  2707	Yike.  Resistance to being pushed and pulled around sometimes
  2708	means being pushed and pulled.  But I would rather be respected
  2709	in my own place with out having to demand it.  Who wouldn`t?  And
  2710	all this shit is a big kaboodle in my brain.  I care I suppose. 
  2711	I care how people are doing (and the Earth for that matter).  I
  2712	care about what kind of world I live in and you live in. I would
  2713	like to live with out having to lock my doors or any number of
  2714	other little yet significant things that split trust in our North
  2715	American culture.  The systems, policies, and attitudes that put
  2716	people and the Earth in shitty positions (eg. poverty) are in
  2717	obvious need of change.  Not only are companies and governments
  2718	being forced to change their environmental policies (not enough)
  2719	but I would like to think that those in control might actually
  2720	care about "tomorrow" more than just for economic reasons.  This
  2721	may be too much to ask or hope for but this is in some weird way
  2722	how I'm trying to live daily. Banking on individual difference to
  2723	make a difference I guess.  I like seeing it work though.  In
  2724	little ways like recycling and using cloth shopping bags, your
  2725	own mug, and such.  
  2726	     New systems that are being developed need to allow for
  2727	humane based foundations.  That is what is so interesting about
  2728	all the new technologies coming up.  I see people still trying to
  2729	make a buck which is great (I guess) but also being conscious and
  2730	considering how these new things will positively and negatively
  2731	effect the environment, which of course includes us.  
  2732	     Do you ever notice that when you say something it could just
  2733	as easily be taken in exactly the opposite way from the way you
  2734	meant it.  The Bible is a classic example.  Interpretation is so
  2735	hinged upon context and language. I have no problem with this.  I
  2736	like it.  Chaos.  What to believe what to believe.  Those old
  2737	"objective" news reports, and scientific experiments, and
  2738	photographs they just don`t hold the same validity that they used
  2739	to if they ever really did.  Maybe it is not necessarily their
  2740	validity that has changed so much as their absoluteness.  They
  2741	are no longer the absolute authority or truth but now just one of
  2742	many points of view.  But unfortunately whoever controls access
  2743	to the means of communication controls the content.  As Jaron
  2744	Lanier said something about telephones being good because anybody
  2745	using one controls the content but not so with a TV.  I have
  2746	nothing more to say and lots more to say.  Lunch time? 
  2747	BLaablablablablablabaaaalbbaaalaaablablablablab.  I feel like
  2748	some feed back.  
  2749	
  2750	     Thank you Heather.  Heather understands.  We were wondering
  2751	though about the disparity between written and spoken words and
  2752	just how immensely different the two forms of communication are. 
  2753	I`m hoping that you, the reader, will understand more or less
  2754	what i`m saying and meaning.  But hey, you might not and that`s
  2755	ok.  Written or spoken or otherwise I might not even know what
  2756	i`m doing.  Ooou, this IS nutty. But that is what is so
  2757	contemporary (to me at least).  Linear logic has become only one
  2758	of many approaches to looking at things. Go see the movie Slacker
  2759	if you haven`t already.  It shows a lot of what different ways of 
  2760	approaching one`s life are going on.  The maker of the film,
  2761	Richard Linklater described a Slacker as:         
  2762	          
  2763	somebody who's not doing what`s expected of them.  Somebody who`s
  2764	trying to live an interesting life, doing what they want to do,
  2765	and if that takes time to find, so be it" (from Mondo 2000 #9). 
  2766	
  2767	That`s sort of what I was trying to get at earlier on.  
  2768	     
  2769	     Now I would like to add in a few words and expressions that
  2770	i wanted to get into this essay(?) but that might not make it in
  2771	if I don`t do it right now.  
  2772	Here they are:  
  2773	
  2774	hip pouches, 
  2775	Maslow`s hierarchy of needs, 
  2776	Kiss My Grits, 
  2777	plate of shrimp, 
  2778	old cars, 
  2779	new cars, 
  2780	postmodernism,
  2781	deconstruction,  
  2782	subjectivity of a kiss, 
  2783	knowing, 
  2784	fear, 
  2785	love, 
  2786	art,  
  2787	hair,
  2788	the running of the goats, 
  2789	fashion,
  2790	raves,
  2791	flow,
  2792	congas, 
  2793	the orb, 
  2794	vibe,
  2795	having a body, 
  2796	not much else cept for music.
  2797	
  2798	And a few of quotations that have everything to do with what I'm
  2799	saying:
  2800	
  2801	"How did you get here?"
  2802	"Same way you did: space ship, Ape City, subway."
  2803	      -Tyler to Brent in Beneath the Planet of the Apes
  2804	
  2805	"What ever you do, take care of your shoes."
  2806	      -Phish
  2807	
  2808	"Pousse mon amour, pousse!"
  2809	      -from Leolo
  2810	
  2811	     To finish up with I`d just like to say that if anybody out
  2812	there has anything they`d like to say to me please do so.  Here
  2813	is where nouveau technologies come in such as e-mail. Feedback on
  2814	a ramble like mine would be much appreciated.  I`d just like to
  2815	know if anybody feels anything that I do.  Via the wonders of
  2816	e-mail I can be found at:

  2829	
  2830	               IS THIS PROGRESS???
  2831	
  2832	                                                  June ,1993
  2833	
  2834	      My insight of contemporary culture and technology is
  2835	looking globally and personally at how the future is fast
  2836	approaching.I wonder how prepared we really are? 
  2837	      Technology has been progressing over the past several years
  2838	blindly in the eyes of society.  I could see that we`re in the
  2839	process of distroying the old world and building a new world in
  2840	its place, at least trying too. The light of technology has
  2841	become overwhelming, while our environment, economy,and education
  2842	are falling a part.  Changes are occuring now and we tend to be
  2843	emotionally attached to our old ways of living rather than try to
  2844	open our eyes to change.  Although we are in a higher level of
  2845	consciousness and awareness from mass media, and mass 
  2846	communication, we`re losing control over work everywhere from
  2847	factories and offices to hospitals and retail stores,as
  2848	computerization is integrating in the stage of the systems. In
  2849	our work environment, we are being controlled by the systems
  2850	logic and are now becoming aware of this transformation and
  2851	implications. But are we prepared to make the change?
  2852	So far it looks as if our perception of technological change and
  2853	economic restructuring has been transformed from social and
  2854	political issues of massive unemployment, demeaning of work, and
  2855	loss of democratic control and personal independence into a
  2856	de-personalized, disembodied technocratic puzzle:  how to
  2857	"manage" the "impacts" of restructuring; how to "adjust" people
  2858	as if they were numbers on a flow chart. 
  2859	
  2860	
  2861	           Its brought jobless employment growth in many plants
  2862	and offices and are reduced to unthinkable procedures by pressing
  2863	keys while technology does most of our thinking. Its as if we're
  2864	being filtered through unnecessary laborers of technology, all in
  2865	the value of the doller.
  2866	$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
  2867	          As uncertain as it may seem, technology is becoming
  2868	more of a reality.  In my own personal experience I have had to
  2869	some what alter my career plans.  I've felt like I have had to
  2870	start all over again. I realized that computers as another artist
  2871	medium tool would be an added skill to other artists like myself. 
  2872	But to have computers as the device of all art mediums in the
  2873	future, I fear to question..?  If technology dominates the medium
  2874	of our ancestrial artists it'll be like eliminating history of
  2875	its craft. To eliminate the craftmanship you eliminate the
  2876	physical technique and expression. I believe that technology is
  2877	blind in the understanding of personal experience and
  2878	expressions.  For instance, if we were to look at a painting on a
  2879	computer screen, how would our perception of artificial image 
  2880	compared to traditionally viewing of painting? 
  2881	
  2882	
  2883	
  2884	
  2885	
  2886	
  2887	How can we see the artists instinctive physical approach to the
  2888	painting?  I can't imagine how computer can transmit such
  2889	information. The only way would be to have the computer transmit
  2890	the mind of the artists. Artists would not have complete control
  2891	over his/her work with a computer. The process of mixing colour
  2892	is a process of creativity and satisfaction of discovering new
  2893	colour by physically mixing where as computers would be
  2894	artificial. Naturally you see the stages of development from the
  2895	beginning to the end piece as a whole,where as with the computer
  2896	your mousing about to find the final result.
  2897	                    Unfortunately I believe painting,
  2898	drawing,sculpture will become a thing of the past and more or
  2899	less it'll be a personal liesure activity ,but when I look
  2900	further ahead I try to imagine what painting will look to
  2901	computer graphics and special effects.  Currently having used a
  2902	bit of the laser printer, I can see that in the near future, the
  2903	resolution on printouts will be as clear as photos, and that
  2904	amateur graphic artists will have medium to nun in design skills.
  2905	They can also become skillfull designers and layout artist. 
  2906	Machines will play a major part in aiding creative skills and
  2907	expression to those with talent musically and artistically.
  2908	Artists will be even more highly regarded in the new age of art
  2909	but the traditional skilled artists will always be well
  2910	respected. 
  2911	     
  2912	
  2913	
  2914	
  2915	      I've heard the latest in our media news about the new 
  2916	visual reality in theatres and that audiences will become more
  2917	intensily involved with film, so much so that too many action
  2918	scenes could rapidly confuse illution of film with reality. How
  2919	much further will this virtual reality go? The thought of virtual
  2920	live T.V. would be amazing,but we would probably virtually not
  2921	want to live ourselves in our real world.
  2922	          Currently I've had a taste of my own experience of
  2923	virtual reality, when I've finally decided to educate myself and
  2924	get over the computer intimidation, which has caused some anxiety
  2925	and frustration. This occured when I first sat in front of one of
  2926	these screen T.V.s wondering if the other students new little as
  2927	much as I did. I thought that going through some of the program
  2928	guides would be a breez, (So I thought)  obviously  didn't make
  2929	computing easy.  I was anticipating instant results but all I was
  2930	getting - "Command not recognized"  to  "Don't understand"
  2931	The amount of time that it lit up the screen I was ready to put a
  2932	hole in the return key. "Now there's some vertual action for ya,"
  2933	I made my exit so I could bring myself back together.  Tolerence
  2934	and patience is definitely a virtue. I wanted answers no matter
  2935	how long it was going to take me.  Having had some good tutorial
  2936	assistance, I found that it wasn't enough.  I realized I was on
  2937	my own to explore the jungles of the Internet, FTP,Gopher and
  2938	EMAIL> etc. Having explored the programs I saw how this new
  2939	technology can and will open a whole new world of communication
  2940	and having access to new tools.   (Not to worry I don't plan to
  2941	regurgitate  the procedures) 
  2942	     I could see how this new technology has unlimited 
  2943	possibilities that are  unimaginative to human thinking.  
  2944	Globally I wonder if this new technology will be beyond human
  2945	control or will we be considered technocratics in the 21st
  2946	century? Hmmmmmmm...     
  2947	          The thought of what 10, 20 years will bring is hard to 
  2948	imagine really.  Really in only seven years, will be in the year
  2949	2000.  I can remember watching the future series 1999 in the
  2950	early 80's and to think that I'd still be here to see that year.
  2951	It's a fearing thought that in 1999 we could live such a cold and
  2952	sterile environment, wearing co-ordinated coloured uniform and
  2953	not being  able to see the light of day. Everyone living in
  2954	uniformity and order with no sense of individuality. Yet six more
  2955	years, who's to say this fictional movie 1999 may hold some
  2956	truths. Interestingly, recently I read an  article by Arther C.
  2957	Clark in which he has some interesting insightful predicaments
  2958	which I found it to be amazingly possible of what a birth
  2959	certificate would look like in the 21st century:

  3045	
  3046	          I wonder what the 21st century schools will be like. I
  3047	think we would constantly be training and retraining and
  3048	learning. Also early training will lead to greater educational
  3049	success later. For example, a grandmother taking a course in a
  3050	small business management where as her sixteen year old
  3051	grandson's getting 1st year college English  early while in
  3052	Universities, students are taking classes in new technological
  3053	development in their field to advance fields in technical
  3054	science.  The emphasis will shift to produce workers for the
  3055	industrial factory based economy which   
  3056	required patience docility and ability to endure boredom. 
  3057	          Knowing that Robots technicians are now increasing in
  3058	demand, new fields will spring up as population increases and
  3059	workers jobs are eliminated by technology. This is obviously
  3060	happening even now where workers are having to go back to school
  3061	to prepare for careers in these new areas. Fortunately technology
  3062	will bring students a smorgasbord of educational choices for
  3063	students of all ages. I can see in the next generation how
  3064	schools will be partly financed by local industries that rely on
  3065	producing and training workers. Technology is transforming
  3066	society itself, in turn computers will take on schools.
  3067	      Artificial intelligence in its infancy will probably
  3068	dominate education or even its growing stages that will probably
  3069	dominate education. 
  3070	          As I look further ahead in artificial intelligence
  3071	meaning robots will be able to see, listen, talk in all ranging
  3072	languages. They'll no longer be a simple-minded dumb insensate
  3073	machine found in factories producing lines.  They'll move out of
  3074	manufactoring plants to working alongside us relaxing with us
  3075	and, live with us. Our homes will become roboticized with central
  3076	intelligence. They'll have control over the cooling, lighting,
  3077	security alarms,and ventilation and light control. Soon they'll
  3078	be able to crack our eggs in the morning without any
  3079	tecno-anarchy.  They'll be adapted to more and more things become
  3080	our robot slaves that we will train and house break. 
  3081	As we get used to the luxury of having slaves we may want them
  3082	around for companionship as well . The thought of haveing
  3083	Robo-dogs and Robo-cats that responds to human voices a companion
  3084	without the kitty litter. "What a concept!" 
  3085	Better yet I found another insightful thought found in the same
  3086	article by Arthur C.Clarke where he uses Joseph Engelberger idea
  3087	of a robot resume .  He believes these artificial intelligence
  3088	beings will become undersea explorers, heavy construction
  3089	workers, crime figurers nuclear power plant inspectors, cybernete
  3090	companies and astronauts. Here's a sample of his robot resume:

  3128	          So where does this leave us ?  The thought of having a
  3129	race of robots which are exactly like humans with the only
  3130	difference they're less subject to mental and physical disease
  3131	and are made of metal (recycled metal) or whatever.  Is it
  3132	possible that these human robots could become immortal?  To
  3133	answer that , it seems anything is possible in the future of
  3134	technology only I wonder about our future as a human race.
  3135	So far globally we're deteriorating but in order to move forward  
  3136	it seems we'll have to make alterations to educate ourselves to
  3137	progress. 
  3138	
  3139	
  3140	
  3141	     I ask ,"What is progress?."  A question,that's always
  3142	puzzled me.  I guess that everyone must try to kick the habit and
  3143	evaluate our values and priorities in the way technology is being
  3144	designed and applied. But then technological change is controlled
  3145	by few people dedicated to maximizing efficiency for competitive
  3146	gain. Yet, population is increasing and I can see a viscious
  3147	technological circle occuring.  In time, if this unwinds and
  3148	takes effect in the next generation, we would have more time to
  3149	educate ourselves to a much broader range of educational choices
  3150	in which we have access communication and information that can be
  3151	transmitted all in our finger tips.At first it's like finding a
  3152	new toy then learning how its used.
  3153	      Also I can see how psychologically some of us can become
  3154	completely obsessed to the computer screen and not be able to
  3155	function normally without it. Is this where the human race is
  3156	heading? This will bring in a whole new stream  of jobs into
  3157	psychological technology, speach therapy, to optometrists as our
  3158	eye sight weakens.
  3159	     This wonderful technology called progress
  3160	seems to let out a lot of bug, causing our physical and mental
  3161	bodies to diminish due to long hours of sitting in front of a
  3162	computer screen accomplishing nothing, to sitting long hours of
  3163	accomplishing something. Then to watch ones documents disappear
  3164	from your very eyes. Of course this, so call PROGRESS doesn't
  3165	always provide such mental and physical strain.                  
  3166	A wise preacher once said "believe in yourself."  he also adds
  3167	not only to believe in ourselves but also our sense of what is
  3168	important, and to use that as our guide in our working and living
  3169	environment in the industrial era.  One thing I'II add which
  3170	makes life so much easier is to SAVE !! SAVE!! SAVE!!

  3178	                                                                  
  3179	     
  3180	In order to start this essay I had decided to answer a question
  3181	from the course outline:" Have we all become artist" ? This
  3182	question will enable me to focus my attention,and allow my
  3183	imagination to grabe hold of the implications of such a thought
  3184	and fallow it into the latest frontier of computer technology.
  3185	this essay is part of the requirements for the Arts and
  3186	Technology class. The class covers in part , practical
  3187	applications of contemporary computer technology. And, as a
  3188	Visual Artist I will attempt to give my interpretation of this
  3189	perceived relationship between the two. This is the first of -
  3190	short  essays concerning my journey as anew and impressionable
  3191	technowiener entering into cybrospace.                            
  3192	                                    The question of whether we
  3193	have become all Artiste, implies, that we have been empowered by
  3194	reason imparted to us by contemporary technology. With this
  3195	evolution of computer technology it seems to be the next medium
  3196	for the Artist to adopt. Be it push button or voice-command,
  3197	mass-consciousness has finally delivered us too the window's of
  3198	cybrospace and virtual reality. Since the nifty 50's the
  3199	Modernist attitude has had mainstream society pinning away for
  3200	great technological advancements and now we're at a threshold.
  3201	However, we are but lowly Pilgrims entering a little knower and
  3202	yet created frontier
  3203	   The implications still remains the same that technology could
  3204	some how induce a type of metamorphose on the human rase and
  3205	transform them into Artistes. However, I am of the belief that it
  3206	is a combination of imagination, inquisitiveness, self-awareness,
  3207	craft and discipline that aspires us as Artiste; furthermore,
  3208	creativity is an inherent human characteristic and not a
  3209	technological induced function. Perhaps our imaginations will be
  3210	further seduced by this technology; thus , limiting or even
  3211	debasing our awareness of reaction to sensation, and then ,
  3212	giving way to a belief that : With computer technology therefore
  3213	I am.   
  3214	
  3215	The Good
  3216	
  3217	                                                                  
  3218	                                                  The demand for
  3219	information and communication is on the rise as more and more
  3220	people discover the tremendous potential of computer networking.
  3221	This resent                          development in technology
  3222	has the capability of    providing a new faster and more
  3223	versatile way of accessing and communicating information. With
  3224	more computer sights coming on line and appearing throughout the
  3225	world more people now  will have access to a larger base of
  3226	information. A medium seemingly     designed for the politicaly
  3227	correct 90's.                      
  3228	   In this age of political  correctness a powerful information
  3229	and communication medium has the potential of being a fantastic
  3230	tool in fostering relationships within your own region through
  3231	either Freenet service or a more international server like
  3232	Internet. The methods of communicating with someone can be either
  3233	by  e-mail, direct connection to the person or persons and by
  3234	posting messages on a community or special interest bolten
  3235	boards, what ever the method chosen it will be a more convenient
  3236	one.
  3237	
  3238	   The fantastic wealth of information sights available to us
  3239	from around the world has given us a form witch to unit people
  3240	global.
  3241	This ability to share knowledge in areas of Education, Arts,
  3242	Technology, Medicine ...etc,etc, simple by making computer files
  3243	accessible to anyone is a great development from this
  3244	technology.Gaining access is simple made by going through 
  3245	directories like Archie and by Database or by simple posting your
  3246	quires on a community bulletin board, either method usually
  3247	yields the desired information on possible communication sights.
  3248	  The befits from computer networking has set the tone for new
  3249	Conventions by creating a new faster more versatile way of
  3250	accessing and communicating information. However, the most
  3251	important development from this technological innovation is its
  3252	accessability. The ability to log into a computer, be it public
  3253	or private, and access information from other sights  around the
  3254	world has finally turn the have notes into the haves. I can only
  3255	hope that people will take the time and nurture this new
  3256	technology not just control it.
  3257	
  3258	
  3259	     The Bad                                                      
  3260	                                                                  
  3261	                          The latest in technological
  3262	advancements made in the area of communication and     
  3263	information services is awe-inspiring. A most hypnotic vision of
  3264	seemingly endless possibilities awaits us in cybrospace. Snap out
  3265	of it! Don't fall, under the trance of this hypnotist, you don't
  3266	even know who he or she is let alone know if their really. Lets
  3267	get back to Canada's economic problems; for example, how about
  3268	the Federal and Provincial fiscal restraint policies and the Free
  3269	Trade deals.  After all, universality of social programs and
  3270	Canada's sovereignty are important issues much more than what the
  3271	latest computer technology has to offer or is it?
  3272	   Perhaps there is an important link between Canada's current
  3273	economic problems and policies that involves technology related
  3274	to cybrospace. The Free Trade agreement between Canada and United
  3275	states plus the possibilities of NAFTA agreement with Mexico
  3276	could be seen in relationship with the latest computer networking
  3277	capabilities and The New World Order. The connection between the
  3278	latest development in the information communication technology is
  3279	part of a Global Infrastructure that connects us with other
  3280	market places and trading blocks. Furthermore, the market place
  3281	will no longer be confined to simple geographic areas and this
  3282	intern will mean more of a Global economy; thus , the once known
  3283	Multinational companies are now known as Global companies.This
  3284	implies  that companies will have greater flexibility in regards
  3285	to development and being more transitory. This method of doing
  3286	business has been made possible by technology like
  3287	Telex-radio-computer networking links.
  3288	   What free trade agreements do for Global companies and there  
  3289	subsidiaries is eliminate trade barriers between respective
  3290	trading partners. With trade barriers down outside investors can
  3291	have a great influence on the sovereignty of host country; for
  3292	example, by claiming unfair trading practices do to particular
  3293	Federal or Provincial past or future policies. Which brings us to
  3294	the most often herd phrase of the 90's "We have to become more
  3295	globally competitive". And we have already seen some examples of
  3296	streamlining and its effects: Down sizing of operations , wage
  3297	rollbacks, and the threatened Universality of social programs
  3298	plus meany others.
  3299	   The connection has been shown to be made between Canada's
  3300	economic and Sovereignty woes and the latest in computer
  3301	technology has made it possible for Governments and Global
  3302	campiness to manipulate  and create a New World Order of polices
  3303	and procedures. The solution to Canada's present problems and
  3304	future self determination is not only being able to use the same
  3305	technology but rather the need for investment into Canada as
  3306	future leader in development of technology.
  3307	   The Ugly                                                       
  3308	                                                                  
  3309	          The creative powers formed by the imagination and
  3310	intuition with its amidiate understanding with out reason has
  3311	brought me to this finaly essay topic : Contempoary music
  3312	regarding communication technology and how people relait to it. I
  3313	remembered the recording by Roger Water's, Radio K.A.O.S from
  3314	1986 and Kate Bush's song, Deeper Understanding from her 1989
  3315	recording of: Sensual World. Both artist approach on
  3316	communication/computer technology as being trivealized by
  3317	societies consumerist attitude and their excessive
  3318	preoccupations.
  3319	   As I read the lyrics from the song : Deeper Under Standing by
  3320	Kate Bush I can relaity to what she is saying and can imagine how
  3321	people can slowly withdrawly from society and become introverted.
  3322	Here are the lyrics from from Kate Bush's song: Deeper Under
  3323	Standing.
  3324	 
  3325	As the people here grow colder
  3326	I turn to my computer
  3327	And spend my evenings with it
  3328	Like a friend.
  3329	I was loading a new programme
  3330	I had ordered from a magazine:
  3331	
  3332	"Are you lonely, are you lost?
  3333	This voice console is a _must_."
  3334	I press Execute.
  3335	
  3336	"Hello, I know that you've been feeling tired.
  3337	I bring you love and deeper understanding.
  3338	Hello, I know that you're unhappy.
  3339	I bring you love and deeper understanding."
  3340	
  3341	Well I've never felt such pleasure.
  3342	Nothing else seemed to matter.
  3343	I neglected my bodily needs.
  3344	I did not eat, I did not sleep,
  3345	The intensity increasing,
  3346	'Til my family found me and intervened.
  3347	
  3348	But I was lonely, I was lost,
  3349	Without my little black box.
  3350	I pick up the phone and go, Execute.
  3351	
  3352	"Hello, I know that you've been feeling tired.
  3353	I bring you love and deeper understanding.
  3354	Hello, I know that you're unhappy.
  3355	I bring you love and deeper understanding."
  3356	
  3357	I turn to my computer like a friend.
  3358	I need deeper understanding.
  3359	Give me deeper understanding.
  3360	                                                                  
  3361	                     In Kate's song : Deeper Understanding, I can
  3362	sight a good example of Ipeople becoming infatuated with the
  3363	seemingly endless possibilities of computer technology. The
  3364	assienment in part given to our computer class was to connect
  3365	with telnet and then into Media Moo. From inside Media Moo we
  3366	were expected to explore and communicat with other users in this
  3367	text-based vertual reality. Once you have become acustom to the
  3368	program's of navigating, interacting with various tools, objects,
  3369	the more ingaged you become. You seem to be cought up in the
  3370	interaction and the dialouge with other users and the archutects
  3371	of this virtual reality you find it hard to leave. And, the 
  3372	potential of computer    programs becoming an obsession and a
  3373	safe  environment is quiet real. The obsservation by Kate Bush,
  3374	maybe simple ; nevertheless, there is alot to the line ,"give me
  3375	a deeper understanding," and how we are driven by it.
  3376	   The concept recording of Radio Kaos by Roger Waters has
  3377	expressed how telecommunication/computer technology has been used
  3378	to trivualize or control our daily lives. Here is the lyrics for
  3379	Roger Waters Radio K.A.O.S: 
  3380	 Author: Roger Waters
  3381	
  3382	
  3383	Benny is a Welsh coal miner.  He is a radio ham.  He is 23 years
  3384	old, married
  3385	to Molly.  They have a son, young Ben, aged 4, and a new baby. 
  3386	They look after
  3387	Benny's twin brother Billy, who is apparently a vegetable.  The
  3388	mine is closed
  3389	by the market forces.  The Male Voice Choir stops singing, the
  3390	village is dying.
  3391	
  3392	One night Benny takes Billy on a pub crawl.  Drunk in a
  3393	brightly-lit shopping
  3394	mall, Benny vents his anger on a shop window full of multiple TV
  3395	images of
  3396	Margaret Thatcher's mocking condescension.  In defiance, he
  3397	steals a cordless
  3398	'phone.  Later that night, Benny cavorts dangerously on the
  3399	parapet of a
  3400	motorway footbridge, in theatrical protest at the tabloid press. 
  3401	That same
  3402	night, a cab driver is killed by a concrete block dropped off a
  3403	similar bridge.
  3404	 The police come to question Benny; he hides the cordless 'phone
  3405	under the
  3406	cushion of Billy's wheelchair.
  3407	Billy is different, he can receive radio waves directly without
  3408	the aid of a
  3409	tuner; he explores the cordless 'phone, recognizing its
  3410	radioness.
  3411	Benny is sent to prison.  Billy feels as if half of him has been
  3412	cut off.  He
  3413	misses Benny's nightly conversations with radio hams in foreign
  3414	parts.  Molly,
  3415	unable to cope, sends Billy to stay with his Great Uncle David,
  3416	who had
  3417	emigrated to the USA during the war.  Much as Billy likes Uncle
  3418	David and the
  3419	sunshine and all the new radio in LA, he cannot adjust to the
  3420	cultural upheaval
  3421	and the loss of Benny, who for him is 'home'.
  3422	Uncle David, now an old man, is haunted by having worked on the
  3423	Manhattan
  3424	project during World War II, designing the Atom Bomb, and seeks
  3425	to atone.  He
  3426	also is a radio ham; he often talks to other hams about the Black
  3427	Hills of his
  3428	youth, the Male Voice Choir, about home.  He is saddened by the
  3429	use of
  3430	telecommunication to trivialise important issues, the soap opera
  3431	of state.
  3432	However, Live Aid has decynicised him to an extent.  Billy
  3433	listens to David and
  3434	hears the truth the old man speaks.
  3435	Billy experiments with his cordless 'phone, he learns to make
  3436	calls.  He
  3437	accesses computers and speech synthesizers, he learns to speak.
  3438	Billy makes contact with Jim a DJ at Radio KAOS, a renegade rock
  3439	station
  3440	fighting a lone rear guard action against format radio.  Billy
  3441	and Jim become
  3442	radio friends, Reagan and Thatcher bomb Lybia.  Billy perceives
  3443	this as an act
  3444	of political "entertainment" fireworks to focus attention away
  3445	from problems at
  3446	"home".
  3447	Billy has developed his expertise with the cordless 'phone to the
  3448	point where
  3449	he can now control the most powerful computers in the world.  He
  3450	plans an
  3451	"entertainment" of his own.  He simulates nuclear attack
  3452	everywhere, but
  3453	compassion.  In a SAC bunker a
  3454	soldier in a white cravat turns a key to launch the counter
  3455	attack.  Nothing happens; impotently he kicks the console,
  3456	hurting his foot.  He watches the
  3457	approaching blips on the radar screen.  As impact approaches, he
  3458	thinks of his
  3459	wife and kids, he puts his fingers in his ears.
  3460	Silence.  White out.  Black out.  Lights out.  It didn't happen,
  3461	we're still
  3462	alive.  Billy has drained the earth of power to create his
  3463	illusion.
  3464	All over the dark side of the earth, candles are lit.  In the pub
  3465	in Billy's
  3466	home village in Wales one man starts to sing; the other men join
  3467	in.
  3468	The tide is turning.
  3469	Billy is home.
  3470	
  3471	
  3472	Jim: This is K.A.O.S.  You and I are listening to KAOS in Los
  3473	Angeles.  Let's
  3474	go to the telephones now and take a request.
  3475	Billy: Hello, I'm Billy.
  3476	Jim: Yes?
  3477	Billy: I hear radio waves in my head.
  3478	Jim: You hear radio waves in your head?  Ah!  Is there a request
  3479	that you have
  3480	tonight for KAOS?
  3481	
  3482	Radio Waves
  3483	------------
  3484	
  3485	Radio waves.  Radio waves.
  3486	He hears radio waves.  Radio waves.
  3487	The atmosphere is thin and cold
  3488	The yellow sun is getting old
  3489	The ozone overflows with radio waves
  3490	AM, FM, weather and news
  3491	Our leaders had a frank exchange of views
  3492	Are you confused, radio waves.
  3493	
  3494	Radio waves, radio waves
  3495	AM radio waves, FM radio waves
  3496	Radio waves, mind-numbing radio waves
  3497	Fish-stunning radio waves
  3498	Radio waves.

  3500	Magic Billy in his wheel chair
  3501	Is picking up all this stuff in the air

  3605	Listen to the whitewalls squeal
  3606	You spend all day looking for a parking spot
  3607	Nothing for the heart, nothing for the pot

  3654	Reagan were president?
  3655	Do you really think third-rate military dictators would laugh at
  3656	America and
  3657	burn our flag in contempt if Ronald Reagan were president?
  3658	Concerned Citizen: Well, it might work!
  3659	Hostage: We as a group do most importantly want to beseech
  3660	President Reagan and
  3661	our fellow Americans to refrain from any form of military or
  3662	violent means as
  3663	an attempt, no matter how noble or heroic, to secure our freedom.
  3664	
  3665	Concerned Citizen: Sure!  Only it's going to be mighty dangerous
  3666	for you,

  3761	The Charles Atlas kicking sand in the face game
  3762	
  3763	And I sit in the canyon with my back to the sea

  3960	The Tide is Turning (After Live Aid)
  3961	-------------------------------------
  3962	
  3963	I used to think the world was flat
  3964	Rarely threw my hat into the crowd
  3965	I felt I had used up my quota of yearning
  3966	Used to look in on the children at night
  3967	In the glow of their Donald Duck light
  3968	And frighten myself with the thought of my little ones burning
  3969	But oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning
  3970	The tide is turning
  3971	
  3972	Satellite buzzing through the endless night
  3973	Exclusive to moonshots and world title fights
  3974	Jesus Christ imagine what it must be earning
  3975	Exclusive to moonshots and world title fights
  3976	Jesus Christ imagine what it must be earning
  3977	Who is the strongest, who is the best
  3978	Who holds the aces, the East or the West
  3979	This is the crap our children are learning
  3980	But oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning
  3981	The tide is turning
  3982	Oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning
  3983	
  3984	Now the satellite's confused
  3985	'Cos on Saturday night
  3986	The airwaves were full of compassion and light
  3987	And his silicon heart warmed

  4020	Computer Art Today
  4021	
  4022	by Tina Sidhu
  4023	
  4024	     The relationship between the artist and the computer is
  4025	likely to prove significant  not only to the fringe artist and to
  4026	the programmer, but to our society as a whole.  We live in an
  4027	increasingly technological society, the combination of art and
  4028	sciences in computer art is a reflection of the times in which we
  4029	live.  The lives of the artist and programmer will inevitably
  4030	overlap more and more, as the computer becomes a more familiar
  4031	and widespread influence on our culture.
  4032	     There is an inevitable range of responses to computer art
  4033	ranging from those based on a fear of computers overpowering
  4034	traditional human artists, to more optimistic beliefs that
  4035	computers will become the most creative and greatest of art
  4036	tools.  Perhaps some universal computer genius with the skills of
  4037	an artist, scientist, programmer and humanist, will change our
  4038	traditional attitudes towards art irrevocably, and bring an
  4039	entirely new and unique style of art forward.   But for ordinary
  4040	individuals, like myself, there is no need to wait for critical
  4041	agreement.  Art is an interpretive subject, and even for myself,
  4042	computers provide enough freedom and opportunities for creative
  4043	interpretation to make the connection.
  4044	      Because computer art challenges society s traditional
  4045	beliefs about art, segments of the general public and the
  4046	artistic  community, can be counted on to react with response to
  4047	the computer medium.  An artist who has not yet delved into this
  4048	new technology simply can not comprehend that the computer can be
  4049	no more or less a  "tool" like the simple paint brush but with
  4050	extra advantages.  The only difference is that the computer is a
  4051	much more complex tool, allowing more options, innovative ideas,
  4052	and creative realms.
  4053	     Prior to forming any sort of opinion regarding computer art
  4054	the artist must comprehend the computer's ability to function for
  4055	him/her at many different levels.  There needs to be an awareness
  4056	of the many roles the computer can play.  For one artist, it
  4057	might be no more than a design aid.  A friend of mine in the
  4058	visual arts department, for example, finds the computer extremely
  4059	valuable to her work as a weaver.  She has described to me how
  4060	she uses the computer to visualize a fabric before it actually
  4061	being woven.  As opposed to weaving on graph paper by hand, the
  4062	computer removes the automatic color preference found in that
  4063	traditional method.  Furthermore, by examining computer
  4064	illustrations the softening of contours which must otherwise be
  4065	seen only after a weaving was removed from the loom, can be
  4066	visualized graphically.
  4067	     In this case, the computer does not threaten the traditional
  4068	weaving methods of an artist but improves them considerably.  The
  4069	artist has more opportunity to be creative and spends less time
  4070	with tedious labours, like coloring in each square in a graph by
  4071	hand.   This allows the weaver time and freedom to experiment and
  4072	therefore, more opportunity to be actively creative.  For this
  4073	reason, the computer is a significant advantage to the artist and
  4074	the art of weaving, itself.
  4075	     The computer offers the artist a vast expanse of areas and
  4076	levels available to explore and master.  A new integrative
  4077	capacity is offered to the artist which can lead into new
  4078	artistic approaches that combines it many features.  The
  4079	combination of artist and oil paint is, for example, a different
  4080	statement than that same artist and watercolors.   Now, rather
  4081	than purchasing oils and paintbrushes from the art supply store,
  4082	the computer artist can simply create the tools to be used on the
  4083	computer, and combine the effect of different mediums, or
  4084	experiment with alternatives.  The fact that one can actually
  4085	create the tools to be used for an artwork is amazing since the
  4086	possibilities it provides, are virtually endless.  There are lots
  4087	of examples of tools to choose from and the ability to combine a
  4088	variety of tools and even mediums into one artwork can prove most
  4089	interesting;  however, the finished work of art still depends on
  4090	the program and the creative abilities of the artist monitoring
  4091	the machine, whether it's a scanner, a musical synthesizer, or
  4092	any other component.
  4093	     I've found that some people feel the computer limits the
  4094	artist's intuitive response to his/her own unfolding creation and
  4095	prevents him/her from leaving any personal trace in the execution
  4096	of the artwork.  This is due to the fact that the computer artist
  4097	has the ability to devise a program which can be suited uniquely
  4098	to a specific artistic conception which allows him/her to reject,
  4099	accept or modify images as they emerge on screen.  However, this
  4100	adds to the artist's creative opportunities in a society where
  4101	deadlines have to be met and the lack of leisure time is a
  4102	serious concern.
  4103	     It must be understood that there are many different mediums
  4104	in the world of art, each to be appreciated in their own right. 
  4105	Rather than constantly battle over the prominence of sculpture or
  4106	oil painting or watercolors, each medium cannot be compared and
  4107	should be appreciated for its unique qualities.  As well,
  4108	computer art should be appreciated as a unique medium itself. 
  4109	Just because the artist can vary the quality of line and
  4110	introduce a variety of colorist effects, does not mean his/her
  4111	finished work is unavoidably inferior when measured against an
  4112	old renaissance master drawing, in which every line and every
  4113	nuance directly reflects its creator's individual response to the
  4114	medium.
  4115	     There could well be more opportunities to view
  4116	computer-generated graphics in their proper artistic context. 
  4117	The creative process is centered in the mind of the artist, like
  4118	his/her ability to conceive an idea for an artwork, the actual
  4119	process in which the work was executed, is received well when the
  4120	results are seen on canvas.  It may be interesting to know, but
  4121	it is not an effective means to judge the actual art itself.  It
  4122	is the idea rather than the artist's technical skills of a
  4123	particular medium which constitutes the appeal of a sculpture,
  4124	painting or drawing.  In fact, a sculptor friend of mine had
  4125	evidenced that the realization of the artist's mental image can
  4126	even occur without their physical involvement or presence.  When
  4127	considered in this context, I feel that the computer is not a
  4128	gimmick but a tool that releases the artist from tedious and
  4129	impossible tasks accomplished by hand.  
  4130	     In many ways, the computer as a new artistic tool, parallels
  4131	to the emergence of photography as the  mechanical medium' of the
  4132	nineteenth century.  There was considerable debate then as to
  4133	whether photography was a medium related to science or art.  Many
  4134	traditional painters were appalled when subject they spent hours
  4135	to recreate by the paintbrush could  be reproduced by the camera
  4136	in a matter of minutes and still be called art.  They refused to
  4137	consider these as works of art just as the traditional canvas
  4138	painter may not believe the brush tool of the paint program could
  4139	possibly match the tool of their own hands.  However,  many
  4140	painters who had enough self-esteem in their own interpretations, 
  4141	eventually considered the camera as a valuable tool.  Such
  4142	artists, even today, who deal with this same debate, use the
  4143	camera as a tool that can easily record the physical
  4144	characteristics of a person, place or object  in a form which can
  4145	be easily consulted for future reference.  Although there is
  4146	still controversy over the artistic nature of the photograph,
  4147	photography has developed into a creative medium in its own
  4148	right.  This occurred at the same time the artists came to accept
  4149	the photograph as an artistic aid which resulted in it being less
  4150	of a threat to the painters. 
  4151	     I find that most of the computer-generated artwork to date
  4152	should be considered as a groundwork for a similar type of
  4153	development toward a still developing artistic medium, because it
  4154	offers so many new directions and potentials.  There has already
  4155	been experimentation in programming the computer to simulate the
  4156	styles of previously existing art, even in the few years that
  4157	computers have become widely available.  Computer art no longer
  4158	is only suited to linear and geometric designs since the
  4159	introduction of new programs that offer tonal gradations,
  4160	free-hand drawing and even the ability to draw complex monuments
  4161	in a landscape setting of precise perspective which have become
  4162	possible with computers as well.  Even so, I think the computer's
  4163	potential as an artist's tool has barely been reached even though
  4164	its value in the field of architecture and commercial design has
  4165	been acknowledged and utilized.  As well, the computer is
  4166	currently being utilized in highly creative ways by such programs
  4167	as Nintendo, virtual reality, Cyber space and autocad.  In other
  4168	words, the possibilities of the computer are endless and we have
  4169	yet to reach its full potential.  I can only imagine what future
  4170	computer technology has yet to offer the contemporary artist.    
  4171	     My own interest in computer technology began through
  4172	watching my grandfather reconstruct archaeological sites and
  4173	their ancient artifacts on the computer.  He kept a permanent
  4174	record of ancient African artifacts and vessels of the most
  4175	extraordinary ceramics dated and at times, reconstructed.  New
  4176	approaches and the more traditional iconographic studies are both
  4177	benefiting increasingly from computerized information retrieval
  4178	analysis.  By transferring cumbersome photographic archives of
  4179	pottery, stele, textiles, site plans, and design inventories onto
  4180	computer or laser disks and cross-indexing iconographic motifs
  4181	and details of manufacture, form and design, researchers such as
  4182	my grandfather are uncovering  significant, formerly obscure,
  4183	correlation's and adding continually to statistical base. 
  4184	     In approaching computers now, with little earlier
  4185	experience, this course has increased my awareness of the many
  4186	advantages technology offers to both artists and architects. 
  4187	Although I enjoy traditional oil painting and sculpting, my
  4188	interests in the computer to date has centered on it as an aid in
  4189	architecture. I have recently experimented with the AutoCad
  4190	design package which is a general purpose Computer-Aided
  4191	Design/Drafting application.  The AutoCad design package is a
  4192	powerful drawing tool.  Although I have a long way to go, it
  4193	follows my instructions and quickly produces the exact drawing I
  4194	want.  AutoCad features let me correct drawing errors easily and
  4195	make revisions without redoing the entire drawing.  The results
  4196	are a production of very precise and clean final drawings.  These
  4197	drawings were not the work of the computer, but a creation of my
  4198	personal ideas that the computer simply allowed me to envision on
  4199	screen.  I do not feel in any way, that if accomplished by hand
  4200	these drawings and designs would have been more artistic and
  4201	personal.  In fact, I feel the program motivates me to improve my
  4202	designs and expand on my creativity.  Of course,  the artist must
  4203	learn of perspective before creating a landscape just like I must
  4204	fully comprehend the program before designing the monument of my
  4205	dreams.
  4206	     Prior to this course I had experienced a few  traditional
  4207	method drafting courses in which I learned alot about dimensions
  4208	and design.  However, the work was slow and tedious to such an
  4209	extent that my creative nature was overwhelmed by the mere
  4210	basics.  In contrast, the computer allowed me to explore my
  4211	abilities to a greater level because drawing simple lines and
  4212	shapes was a very rapid process.  The Autocad program also
  4213	allowed me to envision and create my drawings on a third
  4214	dimensional level.  I could even move and rotate my drawings for
  4215	a more precise understanding of the dimensions,  which is not
  4216	possible with simple flat surface drawings.
  4217	     I found myself quite excited by the discovery of this
  4218	technology which motivated me to explore ideas that traditional
  4219	methods would have kept beyond me.  The only disadvantage, was
  4220	the hours of frustration learning the program.  Learning the
  4221	program consisted of following an unclear reference manual and
  4222	many days of trial and error to master such tasks as a mere arc
  4223	for the doorway.  However, the time it took to learn what little
  4224	I knew about the program was well worth the effort when I was
  4225	able to apply this new technology towards my drafting designs and
  4226	shapes.  This could easily be seen as a parallel to learning
  4227	academic methods in a more traditional medium.
  4228	     I have no doubt that computer technology will inevitably
  4229	have a great impact on the artistic community.  It will offer
  4230	contemporary artists new opportunities which will only increase
  4231	as we get closer to the full potential of the machine.  The art
  4232	world will be exposed to more and more works of art created by
  4233	this new medium.  Once something has been done in art, the art
  4234	world as a whole will not go back--even though some people will
  4235	always go back to painting portraits of their grandmothers.  Now
  4236	that computers have become an integral part of the work of at
  4237	least some artists, I strongly feel that other artists will begin 
  4238	to look at the computer as a viable tool for the production of
  4239	art.  At the same time, I believe that computer scientists and
  4240	programmers are beginning to recognize  that data they produce
  4241	for scientific purposes can be quite aesthetically pleasing. 
  4242	Even these computer scientists are becoming artists.  This is why
  4243	I question whether there is a difference between a programmer who
  4244	works with creative languages like building blocks, and an artist
  4245	who works with shapes.  Both concepts can be equally complex and
  4246	creative.  
  4247	     The computer is a tool created by the scientist and then
  4248	used by the artist in his/her creative expression.  The designs
  4249	accomplished by Autocad have been as useful to me as a technical
  4250	artist and the paint program has been appreciated for equally
  4251	valid, if less functional reasons, by myself, as an artist.  In
  4252	other words, the computer has benefits for both the artist and
  4253	scientist; or more clearly the artist-scientist.  I find that in
  4254	the computer age there is a forced distinction between the artist
  4255	and the scientist.  Is it not unnecessary to divide both when so
  4256	much interrelation is involved?  Would it not be more productive
  4257	for the artist and the scientist to work as one in order to
  4258	double their creative input?  Unfortunately, in modern society
  4259	there is lack of communication between the two. 
  4260	     I found that the overhead expenses in learning the computer
  4261	art medium was by thinking  in terms of forms, shapes and colors
  4262	through numbers and programs.  With paint, the first stroke I
  4263	make yields visual results.  With programming, I have spent many
  4264	hours learning a programming language before  ever really seeing
  4265	a visual image produced with it.  I had to force myself in
  4266	keeping interest in the program medium for its own sake, to not
  4267	get discouraged and put an end to my efforts before ever even
  4268	getting started.  However, this parallels to actually learning
  4269	the technical skills of perspective and brushwork, I had to once
  4270	learn as an artist.
  4271	     Also, I had the computer simulate a traditional art medium
  4272	which I am very familiar, and use it to mimic oil painting.  By
  4273	using  the electronic pen and tablet for input, I was provided
  4274	with a medium very similar to acrylic painting.  On a TV monitor
  4275	I was able to watch a flow of color reflecting my hand and pen
  4276	movement on the tablet.  I could even select brush sizes!  The
  4277	advantage I have with this medium over true acrylic/oil  painting
  4278	is that I am able to change the medium to suit my own personal
  4279	artistic needs through programming.
  4280	     I feel that it takes a particular kind of artist to get
  4281	involved  with the computer art medium.  It takes an artist who
  4282	can cope with dualities, since he/she has to straddle two fields. 
  4283	He/she must have a flexible enough identity to accept the inter
  4284	flow of ideas from one discipline to another.  The artist must be
  4285	motivated enough to pursue what is interesting in spite of the
  4286	labels that have been attached to it by traditionalists and
  4287	conservatives.  There must be an interest in developing both
  4288	hemispheres of the brain.
  4289	     It is almost impossible to imagine what art lovers can
  4290	expect from the computer in the future.  The value of the
  4291	computer for artists lies not in its ability to mimic what an
  4292	individual can do, but in offering a means for that individual to
  4293	accomplish artistic projects that ordinarily would lie beyond
  4294	his/her technical scope. I predict that through the development
  4295	of continually more flexible software,  which could be geared to
  4296	the requirements of  individual artists, the use of computers by
  4297	artists could eventually become as widespread as the conventional
  4298	brushes and oils.  As more and more artists acquire computer
  4299	literacy, the concept of a bona-fide-computer-based scientific
  4300	aesthetic may begin to seem less foreign.

  4308	
  4309	
  4310	CONTEMPORARY  CULTURE  AND  THE  COMPUTER  GENERATION 
  4311	
  4312	Contemporary culture leads us to believe that anything is
  4313	possible. Much of what I have learned in recent history proves
  4314	this to be true. I have been exposed to a remarkable amount of
  4315	information that can be at times overwhelming, yet stimulates the
  4316	possibilities to where the computer age will go. A wonderful, new
  4317	world, still unchartered, awaiting to be discovered.
  4318	
  4319	Now that this has been said, with all of it's excitement and
  4320	promise, let me discuss some issues that have made me cringe! the
  4321	age of technology is relatively new to me, but in the short space
  4322	of time that I have been familiar with computers, there are some
  4323	mixed feelings. Let me discuss some of these thoughts as they
  4324	relate to my world.
  4325	
  4326	My chosen field is the arts. More specifically the graphic arts.
  4327	I began working in a sign shop about three years ago. this was a
  4328	small operation, consisting of three people. the owner learned
  4329	the trade from the "old school". A true sign painter, screen
  4330	printer, and graphic artist. Among many of the other specialty
  4331	skills he possessed included were, airbrush techniques, gold
  4332	leafing, architectural renderings. The shop was small, the
  4333	overhead low, but we still seemed to always be busy. That started
  4334	to change a few years later. It seemed that other shops, who were
  4335	totally computerized, could get the product out much faster than
  4336	we could, therefor charging a much lower price. This is where the
  4337	small shops started to suffer.
  4338	
  4339	I always took pride in knowing that the reason I was hired for
  4340	the job was my artistic talent. Now that I am on my own and
  4341	trying to set up my own business, I am more aware of the true
  4342	impact that the computer industry has on everything today. In the
  4343	old shop there was an older signmaker computer. This computer was
  4344	simply a cutter (cut letters out of self adhesive vinyl), and was
  4345	regarded as just a tool. If for some reason the power shut off,
  4346	we would still be able to do everything by hand. When I left the
  4347	old shop I purchased the signmaker computer for myself. "All set
  4348	now to head out in the world a make my living!... right?" Well,
  4349	maybe get by ... but not a very good living. "I have the skills
  4350	and now I have the technology." I said. "so there should be no
  4351	problem!".   Then I began to wonder why my old boss actually sold
  4352	me that computer. He had said that he was going to upgrade to a
  4353	newer model computer. I then decided to investigate a little more
  4354	about computer systems and their relation to the sign industry.
  4355	What I found absolutely astonished me! Remember that I have
  4356	limited knowledge about computers and their uses. The new
  4357	computer system that my boss had purchased was quite amazing, it
  4358	included approximetly 200 fonts, a scanner, an on screen graphics
  4359	program (the newest CorelDraw) and an interface that linked all
  4360	this to the plotter/cutter. Comparing the old computer with the
  4361	new one was like comparing a Volkswagen Bug with a Ferrari. The
  4362	old computer had a capacity of 8 fonts compared to 200, any
  4363	company logos had to be projected on a wall with an overhead
  4364	projector and then either hand painted or hand cut out of vinyl
  4365	compared to just scanning the image and adjusting the size on the
  4366	computer. Designing logos or layouts for signs had to be done
  4367	with pens and rulers, now this can be done with the push of a few
  4368	buttons.

  4370	These new computer systems are totally revolutionizing the
  4371	industry of Sign making. I can tell you first hand the hours
  4372	saved by these new computer systems. they enable the user to
  4373	produce a cleaner more precise product in a fraction of the time.
  4374	This is where I start to get depressed. How is a small
  4375	entrepreneur like myself supposed to compete against the power of
  4376	the larger shops that are totally computerized with state of the
  4377	art technology?
  4378	
  4379	It has reached the point where the sign industry is no longer a
  4380	"Trade" rather it has become big business. Computers have taken a
  4381	job that required artistic talent and years to learn and master
  4382	and is turning it into a high production, computer generated grey
  4383	area! It has become just another job that anyone can do with
  4384	computer knowledge.  Actually, in a few more years, people won't
  4385	even need computer skills because computers are becoming so user
  4386	friendly.  Not that the industry isn't welcoming new people into
  4387	the sign game, but it is destroying the people who built it. The
  4388	true craftsman of the trade can no longer compete with the speed
  4389	and accuracy of the computer. Much of the problem is that
  4390	technology has and is moving at such a rapid rate that it has
  4391	left many people standing in the dust. The older, strong headed
  4392	man, who says, "Computers will never take over good old hard work
  4393	or knowledge of a trade." is just fooling himself. Plain and
  4394	simple! Even the new generation who grew up with computers has to
  4395	be sharp, or technology will pass them by as well. Oh well,
  4396	Survival of the fittest... I guess?
  4397	
  4398	I am done "Bitching" for a while. This is just a concern from a
  4399	person who is just starting life with hope and ambition and lots
  4400	of doubt and uncertainty. I can see myself in the future becoming
  4401	totally computerized in my business anyway.
  4402	
  4403	As far as the present of technology in the sign industry is
  4404	concerned, they are still coming out with exciting new
  4405	capabilities. I read in the latest issue of "The Sign of the
  4406	Times" (a Sign Arts Magazine) that a computer airbrush machine
  4407	(the Gerber Edge) is just being introduced on the market. This
  4408	computer uses coloured inks to create the airbrushing effect on
  4409	vinyl surfaces. It can also produce multiple and interwoven
  4410	effects, halftones and virtually unlimited special effects. Other
  4411	new computer products on the market include a "desktop engraver",
  4412	which can be used on soft metals, woods and plastics, and of
  4413	course the state of the art in computer software. One of the new
  4414	programs is called the Flewisign-Pro. It is a full colour design
  4415	program with such features as auto welding, kerning, arching
  4416	shadows, colour separating, registration and tilling. Many of the
  4417	features have been specifically developed for the sign industry.
  4418	It was just a matter of time.
  4419	
  4420	Looking to the future in the sign industry, it would appear that
  4421	there will be a split. Computers and technology will divide the
  4422	business apart. There will be the computerized sign shops and the
  4423	custom shops. There is still hope for the small shop, who, for
  4424	what ever reason, chooses not to keep up with advancing technical
  4425	era. Small shops will keep the "trade" alive with that personal
  4426	touch. They will cater to the customer who still enjoys the look
  4427	of hand lettering or that custom specialty sign for their
  4428	business. Although, the average person is going to choose the
  4429	shop that will get the job done faster and cheaper. The bigger
  4430	shops will be constantly on top of the latest technology. A
  4431	computerized shop is essential to keep in stride with the demands
  4432	of competitive business.
  4433	
  4434	How technology affects culture as a whole will be mind boggling.
  4435	It is hard to imagine how the average population will cope with
  4436	the   future monopoly of the computer. I believe that the
  4437	computer as we know it, will be far different in future years to
  4438	come. The personal computer will become the "central nervous
  4439	system" of the home.  It will have the capabilities  to be linked
  4440	and control most aspect of domestic life.  Personal,and business
  4441	finances, scheduling, meals or general daily planning will all be
  4442	governed by the P.C.  As well as controlling day to day concerns,
  4443	the personal computer will have capabilities of obtaining vast
  4444	amounts of information on any subject.  I can see most homes
  4445	running in conjunction with the super information highways of the
  4446	future.  Connection to any info library or satellite link-ups
  4447	could all be performed through the average home based personal
  4448	computer.  The vast amounts of information that will be available
  4449	to every person at any time may be overwhelming. It may reach the
  4450	point to where people will never have to leave their terminal.
  4451	Anything and everything can be reached by the world beyond their
  4452	keyboard.
  4453	
  4454	
  4455	The Internat service that is available, is one of the information
  4456	networks available at the present time.  Although the service has
  4457	limited access at the present time, I do see the general public
  4458	becoming more involved in similar networks in the future. 
  4459	Information and communication networks very well could become as
  4460	common as the telephone service.  Large Internat like
  4461	corporations engaging in advertizing wars to see who will be the
  4462	"king" of the communication-info networks.  Just like AT&T and
  4463	Sprint telephone companies.  Which company offers more
  4464	information or entitles the subscriber access to more
  4465	communication lines!
  4466	
  4467	
  4468	The work place or learning institutions will become factories of
  4469	information, cognitive reasoning and input organized by the
  4470	mighty computer.  The super communication-info highway will
  4471	obviously be the biggest influence in the educational system. 
  4472	Information from anywhere in the world will become accessible to
  4473	institutions.  Computer communication has enabled the educational
  4474	structure to totally change.  Education in the near future will
  4475	be far different than ten years ago.  The use of the book library
  4476	will almost seem obsolete .  All questions, answers or research
  4477	will be solved by linking into an information line through the
  4478	school computer.  Will each individual student have their own
  4479	computer station at their desk?  With the learning programs
  4480	coming out now, the teaching profession could be in serious
  4481	jeopardy.  There may be no need for instructors.  Each student
  4482	just has to sit at their terminal touch the screen and the
  4483	computer takes over.  It won't even be necessary to know how to
  4484	type, just click the mouse.  Life in a screen! How exciting. I
  4485	really hope that the world will not become nothing but an input
  4486	and output,information "data base".  There is something to be
  4487	said about reading a good book.
  4488	
  4489	The onset of the computer industry in the work force has enabled
  4490	most businesses to increase productivity at geometric rates.  We
  4491	see entire company departments controlled by revolutionary
  4492	computer systems.  This brings me to my point.  Are computers
  4493	taking the jobs of many people in the work force?  Of course they
  4494	are!  We see this happening all over.  With such high
  4495	unemployment rates in the country, can we afford to continue?  In
  4496	many cases, one computer system can take the place of dozens of
  4497	employees.  They can do twice the work in a fraction of the time. 
  4498	Obviously, costing the company a lot less money.  The future
  4499	could hold the average worker in the business world obsolete. 
  4500	This would be a great tragedy for all concerned.  This situation
  4501	has already begun to happen in many cases.  One example that
  4502	springs to mind are the telephone operators.  This is an entire
  4503	job force that is literally being wiped out!  There is nothing
  4504	worse than when you have a problem, talking to a computer
  4505	generated voice.  As I have already mentioned that teaching is in
  4506	trouble, I am sure that many other specialized jobs are on the
  4507	same path.
  4508	
  4509	
  4510	As individuals, the age of technology affects each person in
  4511	unique ways.  Everyday activities are being designed to be
  4512	performed at the lowest level of energy and yet yielding the
  4513	highest level of performance.  Convenience is a term that
  4514	technology has tried to sell to the public.  Everything has been
  4515	designed for convenience.  Remote controls, multi-screen T's, 
  4516	the Clapper (the light switch), microwaves, electric
  4517	toothbrushes, all designed for the user to exert the less amount
  4518	of energy as possible.  It gets to be a bit ridiculous.  It's to
  4519	the point where a person sits a computer terminal all day, gets
  4520	home and sits on the couch all night.  I am not saying that
  4521	everyone is like this, but it does happen.  It has to take a toll
  4522	on peoples social skills.  Common, everyday, human interaction is
  4523	becoming extinct.  Communication between people may be performed
  4524	entirely through computer language.  If you believe in the theory
  4525	of evolution,the act of speaking with our voices may disappear. 
  4526	In theory, our voice boxes would become non functional in a few
  4527	million years!  Just a thought!?
  4528	
  4529	  The age group that the advancing technology affects the most is
  4530	the younger people.  Millions of children are engulfed by the
  4531	domination of the video game.  The home versions of these games
  4532	have grown and advanced so much in the last few years. Millions
  4533	of children spend endless hours staring blank and motionless at
  4534	the T screen.  They would rather spend hours playing video games
  4535	rather than playing sports or excercizing.  Many talk shows have
  4536	dealt with this subject, and I believe their concerns are valid. 
  4537	Young people do have the ability to adapt well.  They are being
  4538	brought up in the age of computers.  They have become at ease
  4539	with the notion of the computerized future.  Their sources of
  4540	information are so vast, either through education or television, 
  4541	that they are constantly being bombarded with the latest techno-
  4542	inventions.   Unconsciously they continue to learn, wether they
  4543	want to or not.  I have found this through my own experience. 
  4544	The first time I sat at a computer terminal I already had the
  4545	basic Knowledge to navigate around, just from what I had heard or
  4546	seen.  
  4547	
  4548	
  4549	I am an optimist though. The future could be very exciting. all
  4550	of the communication and the information possibilities are great
  4551	but the some of the entertainment possibilities really excite me.
  4552	
  4553	Some of the movies to come out recently are filled with creative
  4554	and innovative ideas for the future. Total Recall is one movie
  4555	that I found to be fascinating. The notion of transplanting a
  4556	programmed memory into someone so that they actually believe that
  4557	they had been there or done something. Theoretically, someone
  4558	could live there life in one room but still believe that they had
  4559	done and experienced everything they had always wanted. truly a
  4560	fantasy existence. Much of this parallels the work being done in
  4561	Virtual Reality. The possibilities for entertainment value alone
  4562	is endless. anything you have ever dreamed can be realized with
  4563	this system. A trip to the moon, your ultimate sexual fantasy or
  4564	living with the dinosaurs could all be experienced inside a
  4565	computer. Every person in the world will have the opportunity to
  4566	become all they ever dreamed. A different occupation or a
  4567	different sex, they could live in a different part of the world
  4568	if they chose. In the future a person could live their whole
  4569	existence in their own virtual world, coming out only to sleep or
  4570	eat. Even their dreams could possibly be programmed. The progress
  4571	they are making in the field of computer generated graphics is
  4572	staggering.  The recent movie "Jurassic Park" combined the use of
  4573	computer graphics and the older method of stop motion
  4574	photography.  The makers of this movie reached the point of
  4575	making the dinosaurs believable.  The visual picture has made
  4576	tremendous advances through the uses of such tools.  If the
  4577	future of Virtual Reality is as visually stimulating as the
  4578	recent movie age then it will be hard to decipher between fantasy
  4579	and reality.  This, I believe will be the wave of the future.
  4580	 
  4581	Virtual Reality will obviously be not just for entertainment but
  4582	many practical uses. Medical advances, architecture, training of
  4583	any skill or job could be performed with Virtual Reality.  It
  4584	give you the ability to see or perform something before you
  4585	actually do it.  In the medical field, it will give doctors the
  4586	chance to practice a particular operation on something other than
  4587	the living patient.  Health care will no longer be such a
  4588	guessing game which will reduce the risks for patients.  Virtual
  4589	Reality can only benefit the medical field, but is advancing
  4590	technology as a whole, advantageous to the patient?  Life support
  4591	systems have advanced so much in recent years that doctors are
  4592	able to keep brain dead patients alive for many years.  Where
  4593	does mother nature play her role?
  4594	
  4595	"Terminator" the movie, posses some interesting concepts of the
  4596	future.  The idea of artificial intelligence is not so
  4597	inconceivable with the rate computer systems are advancing.  The
  4598	one fact that remains is that computers are the product of what
  4599	people program them to do.  Can people design programs to think
  4600	for themselves?  I sure hope not!  Humans as a race, have enough
  4601	trouble keeping control of things as it is.  The last thing we
  4602	need is to have some computer system telling us what to do.  
  4603	
  4604	Intellectually the human race is capable of creating the computer
  4605	world, but is the human race mature enough to control it?  The
  4606	impact that the computer has on contemporary culture has yet to
  4607	be fully discovered.  The next generation will tell the tale. One
  4608	thing is for certain though, the future will prove to be an
  4609	exciting ride.

  4615	  Portrait of the artist as a young hacker.
  4616	
  4617	by yvette poorter
  4618	
  4619	
  4620	Start here.  In the beginning there was clay. Ya, there was clay
  4621	and paint and stone and marble and cont  and tempera and wax and
  4622	wood and enamel and metal and plastic and fiberglass and
  4623	daguerreotype and microphones and sand.  And there was a
  4624	melodramatic artist with a violent temper, a black beret, a
  4625	life-time supply of sunflower seeds,  a studio in New York, and
  4626	of course: a computer.  Come on, we don t define art or artists
  4627	by whether they conform to specific understood media.  Naa, we
  4628	call it art if it s successful in its use of the medium in
  4629	defining itself - whatever that may be.
  4630	
  4631	  So it s just a matter of adding COMPUTER  to the list of other
  4632	tools and materials used by artists in the past - is that it? 
  4633	Yep, i guess so!  The artists use what is available to them and
  4634	if what s available is insufficient, they develop and create
  4635	something more appropriate.  It s all in relation to intention,
  4636	context, and result.  Certainly with each addition to the long
  4637	list of tools and materials, a re-evaluation of our scales and
  4638	terms is necessary to describe any new art form. 
  4639	
  4640	  With the invention of the camera and its subsequent change in
  4641	status to household item, there came an obsolescence of realistic
  4642	representation in painting, drawing, sculpture, whatever.  But
  4643	with the invention of the camera did art cease to be or did
  4644	everyone toting a camera become an artist?  Well okay, so you've
  4645	probably  heard hundreds of people going on about wanting to get
  4646	into  photography  and loads of them (us) probably did get into 
  4647	it; darkroom techniques -the whole bit!  Still, how much does
  4648	accessibility of equipment have to do with artistic creation? 
  4649	The creative person with access will likely make creative stuff
  4650	but that still leaves the average person with access likely
  4651	making average stuff.  It only makes sense - doesn t it?
  4652	
  4653	  WAIT!  Wait a minute, i don t mean to suggest that computer
  4654	technology will only effect art in its production stage because
  4655	that is by far its smallest influence.  And we don t need to
  4656	redefine ART  or ARTIST  any more than we need to redefine the
  4657	word DEFINITION.  There s way more to it than that.  We need to
  4658	re-evaluate our concepts of space because that big ol  world has
  4659	been reduced to fit through the wires of a computer and the new 
  4660	"NEW WORLD"  is an unchartered place that somehow exists in/out
  4661	there - somewhere.  Bigger still is the weird fact that this new
  4662	frontier is both conceptual and actual at the same time (kinda
  4663	like money).  We re talking about a global communication network
  4664	here - one which has given new meaning to the words access and
  4665	excess.   Information and ideas can be transferred within seconds
  4666	- and we thought planes were fast.  Is there some, as yet
  4667	undiscovered,  jet-lag-like computer ailment - some sort of
  4668	compensation?  Or is this new technology perhaps more in tune
  4669	with true time or a new  dimension?  Oh boy ...  here we go?
  4670	
  4671	  Art is communication and computer technology has opened the
  4672	doors of communication wide.  With Virtual Reality  on the
  4673	horizon, it s predecessors include text oriented interactive
  4674	enviroments such as Media MOO,  where the participants actually
  4675	develop the space/scene as they go along.  Engaged in whimsical
  4676	or serious conversation with whomever is met along the way from
  4677	space to space,  it s up to those involved to decide where they
  4678	want to take it.  It s the act of both reading and writing a
  4679	story at the same time - a story in which everyone has the
  4680	potential to be and meet both fictional and real people.  Light 
  4681	entertainment but with a lot of potential for crossing paths with
  4682	unique individuals world-wide and infinitely more informative and
  4683	interactive than TV.   I mean... if you can call sitting in front
  4684	of a screen with your fingers tapping away, interactive.
  4685	
  4686	  Why is the book better than the movie?  Ya, why is that?  Will
  4687	Virtual Reality  perhaps be the movie adaptation of the MediaMOO 
  4688	book?  By providing the visuals in virtual 3D, no matter how
  4689	spontaneous or stimulating the computer generated images are,
  4690	they are given and do not demand the imagination of the
  4691	participant to the same extent as would text generated images in
  4692	the mind.  Sure, the cinematography in movies can excite and
  4693	portray something as never imagined but it just can t portray it
  4694	as imagined. In the words of Paul Saffo (from the article Hot New
  4695	Medium:Text,  WIRED May/June 1993),  Video enthusiasts are quick
  4696	to argue that images are intrinsically more compelling than
  4697	words, but they ignore a quality unique to text.  While video is
  4698	received by the eyes, text resonates in the mind.  
  4699	
  4700	  No doubt about it, in comparing the imagination s interplay
  4701	with text versus its passivity with video, we can understand the
  4702	fundamental differences of the mind s experience. Then again,
  4703	without the visuals dance just wouldn t cut it!  Without the
  4704	visuals and sensuals, physical acts just "aren t"!  Imagine
  4705	venturing to compare sitting on the grass with reading about the
  4706	grass, having sex with reading about it, eating chocolate with
  4707	reading about it ... NOPE!  Real life wins for being out there in
  4708	the physical - and real life even has room for the books and the
  4709	video and whatever else we invent into it!  So where does Virtual
  4710	Reality fit in?  It would seem that virtual reality is an attempt
  4711	to combine the physical act with the conceptual one. 
  4712	
  4713	  Having myself only been introduced to computers within the last
  4714	month, already a lot of apprehensions have subsided. Schooled
  4715	during a time before computer access, i m way too familiar with
  4716	the fear and skepticism felt by the computer-illiterate.  Wanting
  4717	in, wanting to resist, wanting to understand what it s all about
  4718	- but from the outside not the inside.  Aha, but our computer
  4719	demands that i stand in  its mouth to hear it speak!  Well here i
  4720	am, ready to climb into the belly of the crocodile i m attempting
  4721	to tame.  Heck, it s only a virtual crocodile anyway...
  4722	
  4723	  So i got lured in - so i like it - so i m dying to learn more 
  4724	about utilizing the networks - so i can t figure out just how it
  4725	s possible to run out of space when we re dealing with something
  4726	so minute (how many cans of megabyte fit on the RAMshelf?
  4727	Hmmm...) - so Jaron Lanier charmed me into enthusiastic support
  4728	of his Virtual Reality - so what?  It s only real life and here i
  4729	am in it.  When it comes right down to it, it s all what my mind
  4730	perceives and how it organizes its perspective.  We accept the
  4731	paper we call money, giving more value to a $100 bill than to a
  4732	$20 bill and we take a figure on a piece of paper to represent
  4733	lots and lots of bills, although we know these bills don t
  4734	actually exist.  All our beliefs and truths are arbitrary anyway,
  4735	so why not indulge them with the virtual experience?  It s not as
  4736	though we re trying to fool anyone; we re just playing around
  4737	with new forms of experience and knowledge.  Takin  in whatever
  4738	is out there and incorporating it.  The computer revolution has
  4739	created so many new forms of experience as well as new outlets
  4740	for expressing them and sharing them globally.  And access - oh
  4741	wonderful access!
  4742	
  4743	  Access of information - the latest news coming straight from
  4744	the source and from a variety of perspectives!  Is it really
  4745	possible that through these new global networks we will be able
  4746	to bypass such government censoring as we were subjected to
  4747	during the 1991 Gulf War?  Will this accessibility  be the
  4748	dawning of a true democratic era?  It would seem that  roaming
  4749	around the network, reading files and reports written by anyone,
  4750	anywhere , we will be able to truly organize as an informed
  4751	populous and finally have political clout on both a local and
  4752	global level.  No longer will we depend upon edited news reports
  4753	which are dictated by government and corporate powers.  In fact,
  4754	we wouldn t even have to leave our homes to organize politically. 
  4755	Through the networks, even the little people would be heard. 
  4756	Hooked up to our computers we ll be able to roam around the
  4757	planet without so much as a toothbrush packed!
  4758	
  4759	  Excess  of information -  the latest news coming straight from
  4760	all sources, everywhere, all the time!  How much can one possibly
  4761	absorb?  Having the freedom to select for yourself what to
  4762	believe doesn t necessitate having the free time or even the
  4763	desire.  Saturation will still be inevitable  and weariness will
  4764	still immobilize people.  Those who aren t politically active now
  4765	aren t likely to jump up in this new computer age and take a
  4766	stance on any issues.  Even if we did have the ideal  computer
  4767	generation ,  in which everyone was excited by the potential and
  4768	wanting to utilize it, what about all those who aren t hooked up? 
  4769	So i could get in there with my little (but objective) voice and
  4770	drum up support to try and get those villains out of that jungle
  4771	or save that forest.   I very much doubt that those villains or
  4772	those laborers have a case of "computer-butt".  In fact, i doubt
  4773	that any of the repressed people will be given computer access
  4774	and even if they are allowed up to the computer control panel
  4775	they probably won t have the know-how to effectively utilize it. 
  4776	Just another case of insisting that the natives play by our rules
  4777	and on our terms.The silent majority will remain silent and that
  4778	idyllic democracy will be made up of an elite of like-minded
  4779	people who think they know what s best - perhaps while the rest
  4780	play virtual reality games, read their way around the network,
  4781	eat at Joe s or starve because of the environmental conditions in
  4782	their physical world. 
  4783	
  4784	  Just as the automobile, air travel, photocopying, and even the
  4785	written word have become common place props in our reality, so
  4786	too will (already has?) the global networks of computer
  4787	communication.  And just as every new vehicle and/or
  4788	communication device has threatened extinction or forced
  4789	obsolescence of the old means, so too will the computer
  4790	revolution.  Simultaneously creating new needs and industries. 
  4791	With a state of the art TV comes a comes a state of the art TV
  4792	repairman.  With an increase in fragmented, short flashes of
  4793	images and statistics comes a generation of people adapted to
  4794	ingest it.
  4795	
  4796	 It would seem that efficiency is our ultimate goal.  The
  4797	telephone reduced the time and the paper it would take to
  4798	communicate over distance.  The automobile, train, and airplane
  4799	reduced the time and improved the likeliness of long distance
  4800	travel.  The calculator reduced the time and raised the level of
  4801	ability in problem-solving.  The computer reduces paper waste,
  4802	improves accessibility and diversity, and virtually abolishes the
  4803	time of covering  distance.   Believe it or not,  computers have
  4804	somehow confounded the laws of physical space and have created
  4805	their own huge world of cyberspace. 
  4806	
  4807	efficiency  (i fish en se), n., pl. -cies.  1.  the state of
  4808	being efficient.  2. accomplishment of or ability to accomplish a
  4809	job with a minimum expenditure of time and effort.   3.  the
  4810	ratio of the work done by a machine to the energy supplied to it,
  4811	usu. expressed as a percentage.   (Random House Webster's College
  4812	Dictionary)
  4813	
  4814	  Although we all seem to want to run our lives in the most
  4815	efficient way possible, it is the expenditure of time and effort
  4816	which gives value and satisfaction to our lives.  Without time
  4817	and effort we would be trapped in some sort of lethargic eternity
  4818	of a stagnant moment.  As it is, we try to immunize ourselves
  4819	towards the wiles of time by attempting to stave off the effects
  4820	of aging and such.  Indeed, if i don t go out there s no chance i
  4821	ll get shit on by  a bird or bitten by a dog, no street kid will
  4822	ask me for money and i won t get salt stains on my shoes, i can t
  4823	get AIDS and no propaganda will influence my choices.  If i can 
  4824	save time and protect myself from potentially hazardous exposure
  4825	by utilizing the unbiased network in my computer, why not?  What
  4826	is the computer synonym for couch potato  ? 
  4827	
  4828	  Idealists in the computer movement envision a society in which
  4829	people are interacting, unprejudiced by the old isms and skisms
  4830	of race, gender, age, etc.  They believe they have abolished
  4831	hierarchies and prejudices, simply by a removal of the obvious
  4832	physical attributes.  But judgement and classification are the
  4833	basis of our personalities.  What we perceive, how we judge it
  4834	and how we classify it is what describes us.  Already, those
  4835	within this fantastically extensive network  have proven their
  4836	computer-sympathetic ideals simply by being within the system 
  4837	and they have also proven that they have both access to and
  4838	literacy within this system.  How equal are the voices of those
  4839	doing manual labour or in third world countries or not within
  4840	prescribed educational systems in our so-called open and unbiased
  4841	computer network? 
  4842	
  4843	  If we look at how every technological breakthrough which has
  4844	allowed us faster, safer, slicker and easier lives, we see that
  4845	although people seem to be able to do so much more, they become
  4846	lazier, sicklier, and more isolated.  Even though these global
  4847	networks allow us to interact (or inter-express) unabashedly with
  4848	others from all walks of life, we are doing so from a controlled
  4849	environment.  Like occupying the seat of a god, we look out from
  4850	our desks and weigh the information we ve received and with our
  4851	answering-machines filtering our calls and a pizza delivered to
  4852	the door, we are able to avoid spontaneity of circumstance.  In
  4853	cyberspace we can sit idle or we can quit  the program or we can
  4854	find the file we need when we need it, whereas a trip to the
  4855	library might mean bumping into someone you know or may find the
  4856	book already on loan or may find you caught in the rain.  All of
  4857	which might turn out for better or worse - who knows eh?
  4858	
  4859	  Remember the days before the telephone?  Oh those intimate days
  4860	when communication depended upon physical proximity or the
  4861	written word.  Reach out and touch - as it were.  Back then, i
  4862	would have gotten on my bike and ridden over to your house to say
  4863	hello and given you a big hug.  Now, the slug that i am sits
  4864	lazily by my stereo remote and touch-tones into the cordless, 
  4865	Hello answering machine...   Damn, i should really get myself a
  4866	Stairmaster !
  4867	
  4868	  No, i don t remember the days before the telephone either!  And
  4869	why bother anyway - it s not as if romanticizing the idyllic 
  4870	before  will improve life.  The telephone is as much a part of us
  4871	and ours as a tree or the moon or (soon-to-be) the computer is. 
  4872	Naa, i never would have gotten on my bike to visit you; what with
  4873	you living thousands of miles away as you do.  In fact,if not for
  4874	the ease of the telephone, i d probably have lost touch and long 
  4875	forgotten your name - no hug for you!
  4876	
  4877	  Let s get closer to something real... let s say we talk about
  4878	the intimacy of a stylus stroking and tracing vinyl grooves.  It
  4879	s a wide shot of the room,  late afternoon sun wafts through the
  4880	window and past the silk scarf of  a curtain.  Slowly we zoom in
  4881	to a close-up of  the phonograph (stereophonic sound no less) we
  4882	fade in the music,  ...crackle, crackle...  a little sax and
  4883	piano...  The music ends but the crackling lingers like the
  4884	flavor of red wine.  Slowly the arm lifts and replaces the needle
  4885	to its elevated resting spot and with two sluggish rotations the
  4886	record draws to a halt.  If you pass me that flashlight i ll show
  4887	you how the spinning CD looks through this little window here!
  4888	
  4889	Technology (tek nol e je), n., pl. -gies. 1. the branch of
  4890	knowledge that deals with applied science, engineering, the
  4891	industrial arts, etc. 2. the application of knowledge for
  4892	practical ends. 3. a technological process, invention, or method.
  4893	4. the sum of the ways in which social groups provide themselves
  4894	with the material objects of their civilization. 5. the
  4895	terminology of a field; technical nomenclature. (1605-15; < Gk
  4896	technologia  systematic treatment = tech (e) art, craft, skill,
  4897	set of rules in art (akin to tecton; see TECTONIC).
  4898	(R.H.Webster's College Dictionary)
  4899	
  4900	  No, i don t see any reference to technology being a thief of
  4901	intimacy and instigator of impersonal sterile communication.  But
  4902	isn t it true?  Kinda?  I mean, gone are the days of hand-written
  4903	love notes emanating the mingled scents of perfume, ink, paper
  4904	and dressed in the fingerprints and lip marks of their sender! 
  4905	First it was replaced with the cold type-written letter but still
  4906	there were Liquid Paper swirls betraying imperfect spelling or
  4907	changes of mind.  Then we had the word processor whose
  4908	spell-check and justified margins cleaned up those edges and
  4909	whose choice of fonts feigned personalization.  Heck fire, what
  4910	could possibly be next?
  4911	
  4912	  Ah, who am i fooling here?  Those turntable and love letter
  4913	images are fantasies created by  desire.  Our imaginations
  4914	sensualize and embellish our world and then we try to make the
  4915	world more like the fantasy.  And why not?  It s that movement
  4916	between physical sensations and mental sensations that makes up
  4917	all that shit that s worth living for.  Soaking in that music,
  4918	that texture, those colours, that flavour, those words,  stirring
  4919	it around in your head, letting your imagination adjust the
  4920	levels and coming up with something else, and then bringing that
  4921	out into the world through words or images or objects or or or... 
  4922	How closely can you represent  your fantasy in a material way? 
  4923	Nobody s stopping you from sending that illegible, greasy,
  4924	smelly, intimate, scrawl of a letter.  The first turntable must
  4925	have seemed like an abominable sterilization of the  musical
  4926	experience.  Musicians still perform live and technology seems to
  4927	simply have broadened the range of what they can do by
  4928	introducing shortcuts and importing sounds.  We haven t replaced
  4929	the live performance or quality of musician, we ve simply
  4930	introduced new forms to the art.  Our society needs the quick
  4931	pace and variety to stimulate us  because we quickly tire of what
  4932	s already been done.
  4933	
  4934	  Although technology has allowed the artist a broader range of
  4935	tools and media, we can t deny that there are millions who have
  4936	the money to utilize the same technology to create  stuff .  Does
  4937	having the technology and the money make the art and the artist? 
  4938	At first glance, we might be impressed by the newness of its
  4939	product but we are soon to decipher what is good from what is
  4940	simply utilization of the tools.  Artists, whether rich or poor
  4941	will make things from whatever they can get hold of and it is
  4942	that ability to actualize the concept which makes an artist.  The
  4943	programmer has an idea and if they have creativity the product is
  4944	fantastic.  New ideas and technologies come from creative minds
  4945	who are able to bring them from their imaginations.  Utilization
  4946	of creative tools is similar to making a Van Gogh-esque painting
  4947	- it might be kinda nice but it won t be art because its not new
  4948	or innovative or exciting or expressive of itself - just familiar
  4949	and easy.  Utilizing the tools of the computer, the secretary
  4950	might be able to do slick layouts and designs but it will take an
  4951	artist to invent new methods of expression.
  4952	
  4953	  Whether we are hackers, programmers, musicians, political
  4954	activists or scientists, we will all be easier able to actualize
  4955	our ideas through utilizing programs, files, and other
  4956	people/institutions which are on-line.  And this, by bringing
  4957	things closer within reach and making the world smaller, makes
  4958	our lives more competitive.  Where before the artists or
  4959	mathematicians or philosophers had to be outstanding among their
  4960	peers and communities, they now must be outstanding among
  4961	billions of people world-wide.  We certainly may be able to
  4962	quickly maneuver our way through complex networks and mazes (like
  4963	good lab rats)  but indeed the wheel below our feet spins
  4964	matching the pace. 
  4965	
  4966	  When it comes to this new frontier called Cyberspace, we must
  4967	realize that the rules haven't as yet been defined.  Before this
  4968	network is made accessable to the general population, the
  4969	government and big business will be in there, protecting their
  4970	own best interests by catering to our interests.  In exchange for
  4971	a service made cheap, safe and easy, we will be forced to accept
  4972	commercials and and stringent controls.  What now exists in its
  4973	innocence as an open, interactive and uninhibitted domain will
  4974	eventually be little better than TV.  All our couch potatoes will
  4975	be replaced by something - probably french fries. 
  4976	
  4977	  In the words of William S. Burroughs, "We're all here to  go."
  4978	(The Western Lands,1987). In the words of Anton DeGiusti, "Ya,
  4979	so?"  In the words of Chris Wyman, "But when you average it out
  4980	it's a straight line."  In the words of Karin Foreman, "That
  4981	wasn't a relationship, that was a phone bill."  In the words of
  4982	Don  Macdonell, "They never did make them like they used to."  In
  4983	the words of Lance Blom Grin, "I was just about to think that." 
  4984	In the words of Stephen Collis, "Let's order pizza...and eat it!" 
  4985	Noam Chomsky probably had some words too but i was too busy
  4986	watching TV.
  4987	
  4988	      ...now what?  After all, there was no dress rehearsal and
  4989	collectively and individually we re just doin  what it takes to
  4990	get by the easiest and with the most enjoyment.  Ahh, too much
  4991	philosophizing - we all know the shape of our catch-22.  We're
  4992	just constantly in a battle to redefine it.  As if it means as
  4993	much as all that.  Ya, as if!

  5261	  Umberto Eco in Foucault's Pendulum talks about memory, how we
  5262	use it and how computers have changed how we use it.  
  5263	"This is better than real memory, because real memory, at the    
  5264	cost of much effort, learns to remember but not to forget. ...
  5265	there is no discipline of forgetting; we are at the mercy of

  5271	long       sentence that I wrote but then wished that I hadn't,
  5272	wished I   hadn't even thought let alone written it, wished that
  5273	it had never happened.  So I pressed a key, and a milky film
  5274	spread over the fatal and inopportune lines, and I pressed delete
  5275	and, woosh, all gone.
  5276	But that's not all.  The problem with suicide is that sometimes
  5277	you jump out of the window and then change your mind between the
  5278	eighth floor and the seventh.  " Oh if only I could go back!"
  5279	Sorry, you can't, too bad.  Splat.  Abu, on the other hand, is   
  5280	merciful, he grants you the right to change your mind:  you can
  5281	recover your deleted text by pressing retrieve.  What a relief!
