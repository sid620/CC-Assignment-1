    26	1.0.1 - The First Line of a script
    27	컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
    28	
    29	Format -
    30	<Application Description>
    31	
    32	Purpose:This first line of the Script file(any file with .SCR) tells the 
    33	        application generator the description for this Application, and must
    34	        be the first line, otherwise you'll get wierd undesired results, limit
    35	        40 chars
    36	
    37	Example -
    38	This is a Test application
    39	
    40	What's Done:This information is used for the highlight bar
    41	
    42	1.0.2 - The Second Line of a script
    43	컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
    44	
    45	Format -
    46	OUTFILE:<Output.Nam>
    47	
    48	Purpose:This Second line of the Script file tell the application generator
    49	        what file the output text should be written to, make sure this is 
    50	        allways the second line in your Script file you you'll get wierd
    51	        undesired results.
    52	
    53	Example -
    54	OUTFILE:WRITE2ME.OUT
    55	
    56	What's Done:The filename provided here will be written to whenever INPUT: is
    57	            used.
    58	
    59	1.1.1 - The ANSI:      Command
    60	컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
    61	
    62	Format -
    63	ANSI:<Filename.Ext>
    64	
    65	Purpose:This command may be placed anywhere after the first two lines of a
    66	        script, where <Filename.Ext> is the Ansi file you wish to display
    67	
    68	Example -
    69	ANSI:TEST.ANS
    70	
    71	What's Done:This will display the ansi file named TEST.ANS to the user
    72	
    73	1.1.2 - The PAUSE:     Command
    74	컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
    75	
    76	Format -
    77	PAUSE:<String>
    78	
    79	Purpose:This command may be placed anywhere after the first two lines of a
    80	        script, where <String> is your pause string. This command will display
    81	        your pause string and the wait for the user to press any key to 
    82	        continue, all codes are supported(Section 1.2.1)
    83	
    84	Example -
    85	PAUSE:Press Any Key to Continue
    86	
    87	What's Done:This will display "Press Any Key to Continue" to the user and
    88	            wait for him to press a key
    89	
    90	1.1.3 - The DISPLAY:   Command
    91	컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
    92	
    93	Format -
    94	DISPLAY:<String>
    95	
    96	Purpose:This command may be placed anywhere after the first two lines of a
    97	        script, where <String> is what you wan't to display on the screen.
    98	        All codes are supported(Section 1.2.1)
    99	
   100	Example -
   101	DISPLAY:Show this text to the user
   102	
   103	What's Done:The example above will print out to the user "Show this text to
   104	            the user" to the screen
   105	
   106	1.1.4 - The SETxx: Command
   107	컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
   108	
   109	Format -
   110	SETxx:<String>
   111	
   112	Purpose:This command defines a macro(@xx, xx= 01-99), where 'x' in SETx is a 
   113	        the macro number you wish to set. Thus @xx in a DISPLAY: command
   114	        will display macro #xx(where xx is - 01-99) on the screen it you have
   115	        set it. All other codes are supported(Section 1.2.1) for the <String>
   116	        part of the command. This helps save typing and makes the application
   117	        generator more flexibal.
   118	
   119	Example(s) -
   120	SET01:Hello there #1
   121	SET02:Hello there #2                
   122	...
   123	SET99:Hello there #99!!!
   124	
   125	DISPLAY:@01@02@99
   126	What's Done:What's done here is defining a macro, so you may print out text
   127	            that's commonly used quicker without having to type it over and
   128	            over again. Thus when you use a DISPLAY: command you'll see whats
   129	            been put into the macro's appear inplace of the @01, @02, etc...
   130	            NOTE:YOU MAY DISPLAY ANOTHER MACRO FROM A MACRO. See Below
   131	
   132	Example(s) -
   133	SET01:Hello 1
   134	SET02:Hello 2
   135	SET03:@01@02
   136	
   137	What's Done:Here we defined a macro to print out other macro's. When you use
   138	            a display command to display macro 3, @03, you'll see both macros
   139	            1 and 2, like so
   140	
   141	Hello 1Hello 2
   142	
   143	1.1.5 - The INPUT:     Command
   144	컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
   145	
   146	Format -
   147	INPUT:xx:<Write to App File>;<String>
   148	
   149	Purpose:This command may be placed anywhere after the first two lines of a
   150	        script, where xx is a number between 01 to 80(make sure there are two
   151	        spaces for the vaule you specify, this will keep the program from 
   152	        getting confused) that limit the input lenght. Where <Write to App
   153	        File> is the text you want in the output app file, this string must be
   154	        seperated by a Semi-Colon to make sure the program determines between
   155	        <Write to App File> and <String>. Where <String> is the text you wan't
   156	        displayed before input begins, All codes supported for this string
   157	        (Section 1.2.1)
   158	
   159	Example -
   160	INPUT:09:This user's handle:;Please enter in your handle:
   161	
   162	What's Done:This is print to the screen...
   163	
   164	Please enter in your handle:
   165	
   166	...and will limit the user's input to 9 charecters and save this to the
   167	output text-file with...
   168	
   169	This user's handle:
   170	
   171	...before the input the user types in, then whatever the user typed in will be
   172	save after this information.
   173	
   174	1.1.6 - The END:       Command
   175	컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
   176	
   177	Format -
   178	END:
   179	
   180	Purpose:The main purpose of this feature is to tell the application generator
   181	where to stop in the srcipt, if you ommit this statement at the end of the
   182	script that's fine to, because the script generator will automatically force
   183	this END: statement when exucting it and reaching the last line in the script
   184	file, you can however use this to debug your scripts by placeing it so it'll
   185	stop at different points in the script(for debuggsing purposes mostly)
   186	
   187	Example:
   188	END:
   189	
   190	What's Done:Heh. just end's the program
   191	
   192	1.1.7 - The RUNAPP:    Command
   193	컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
   194	
   195	Format -
   196	RUNAPP:<AppName>
   197	
   198	Purpose:The main purpose of this command is to allow you to run other 
   199	        applications, this allows you the user to design you own highlight
   200	        bar system by writing the script for it.
   201	
   202	Example:
   203	RUNAPP:Ansi.App
   204	
   205	What's Done:Ansi.App is looked for and if it's found it will be executed if
   206	            it's not found the application Generator will notify you.
   207	
   208	1.1.8 - The GOTO:      Command
   209	컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
   210	
   211	Format -
   212	RUNAPP:<LabelName>
   213	
   214	Purpose:Well this was put in by popular demand, where <LabelName> is the
   215	        label you would like the continuing of the application to occur, a
   216	        label is named by putting a ':' before the name of the label
   217	
   218	                Example - 
   219	                        :THISLABEL
   220	        Labels can be any lenght, and are not case sensitive, it is possible
   221	        to have two labels with the same, but in different case, 
   222	
   223	                Example - 
   224	                        :THISLABEL
   225	                        :thislabel
   226	
   227	        The application Generator treats these as two seperate labels. Using
   228	        the same labels isn't advised...
   229	
   230	                Example -
   231	                        :THISLABEL
   232	                        :THISLABEL
   233	
   234	        The Application Generator just searchs for the first labelname that
   235	        matches the one you told it to go to, above the second :THISLABEL
   236	        would never be executed.
   237	
   238	Example:
   239	GOTO:START-THIS-APP
   240	:START-THIS-APP
   241	
   242	What's Done:The application Generator will jump to the First label matching
   243	            START-THIS-APP, and continue running the application from that
   244	            line.
   245	
   246	1.1.9 - The CHCx: Command
   247	컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
   248	
   249	Format -
   250	CHCxx:<String>
   251	
   252	Purpose:This command defines what ASK:(See ASK:     Command) should display 
   253	        when the use highlights this choice, you may even use the
   254	        @DA<Ansi-FileName>% Command for the <String> portion to display an
   255	        ansi instead of typing in the choice yourself. You can now make the
   256	        Maxtrix look any way you wan't it to. You can also use all the other
   257	        codes to locate the row, column, set the foreground and background
   258	        color codes (Section 1.2.1)
   259	
   260	Example(s) -
   261	CHC1:Option #1
   262	CHC2:Option #2
   263	...
   264	CHC9:Option #2
   265	
   266	ASK:9
   267	
   268	What's Done:What going on here is that you have defined the options to use
   269	            when you use the ASK command to allow the user to choose an
   270	            item and then press enter on it(See Section 1.1.A)
   271	
   272	1.1.A - The ASK: Command
   273	컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
   274	
   275	Format -
   276	ASK:x
   277	
   278	Purpose:This command allows the user to press the UP and DOWN arrow keys and
   279	        highlight a Option and then press enter to choose that option. where
   280	        the 'x' is let's ask know how many choices(from 1 to 9) to allow the
   281	        user to select.
   282	
   283	Example(s) -
   284	ASK:5
   285	
   286	What's Done:What will happen is that ASK will wait for the user to highlight
   287	            and choose(press enter on) the option you wan't, the with the
   288	            JMPx:<LabelName> command allows the program to jump to
   289	            <LabelName> if choice 'x' was choosen, see example for JMPx
   290	
   291	1.1.B - The JMPx: Command
   292	컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
   293	
   294	Format -
   295	JMPx:<LabelName>
   296	
   297	Purpose:After a ASK:x command has been executed a vaule is returned of what
   298	        option they choose, then JMPx:<LabelName> allows your script to
   299	        branch out to different choices. IE...
   300	
   301	Example(s) -
   302	ASK:4
   303	JMP1:Option1
   304	JMP2:Option2
   305	JMP3:Option3
   306	JMP4:Option4
   307	
   308	What's Done:What will happen here is after ASK has executed a vaule will be
   309	            returned, ASK was limited to 4 choices, so depending on what
   310	            choice the USER choose the script will GOTO another part of
   311	            the program according to the Option choosen. So say i choose
   312	            option 2 when ASK was run, the program would goto Label Option2
   313	            and continue executing the script from there. This is handy for
   314	            making your own lightbar selection for Applications.
   315	
   316	1.2.1 - The Color Codes/Keycodes
   317	컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
   318	
   319	The list provided below is for the sole purpose of adding color and flexibity
   320	to your scripts...
   321

   336	        Blink/Unblink:
   337	
   338	|24 - Blinking on   |25 - Blinking Off
   339	
   340	The "@" Code's
   341	==============
   342	
   343	(Please note the "xx"'s must allways be two charecters even tho you could 
   344	write 1 as "1", but only "01" would work, etc..)
   345	
   346	@CR - Carriage, will go to the next line and set cursor in column 1
   347	@CL - Will clear the current screen
   348	@LS - This will save the current Row and Position.
   349	@LL - This will restore the last save Row and Column
   350	@LRxx - where XX is a number between 01-25, locate's that row on the screen
   351	@LCxx - where XX is a number between 01-80, locate's that column on the screen
   352	@SDxx - where XX is a number between 01-99, delay's xx/100 th's of a second
   353	@SBxx - where XX is a number between 01-80, backspace xx number of spaces
   354	@DA<FileName>% - Displays <Filename> may also be an ANSI file, but make sure
   355	                        the '%' is after the filename so the program know
   356	                        what the last charecter of the filename is.
   357	
   358	RUNAPP:<Filename>    
   359	GOTO:<Labelname>
   360	SETx:<Macro-String>
   361	CHCx:<Choice-String>
   362	JMPx:<Labelname>
   363	ASK:<UseChoices>
