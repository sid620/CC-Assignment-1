     5	I. Hardware considerations:
     6	
     7	The AT/16 coprocessor card and the MC/16 microchannel card tested were
     8	found to work with QEMM 6 without the need to exclude any High RAM
     9	addresses.
    10	
    11	The XT coprocessor card needs an exclude and this address is normally at
    12	CC00-CFFF but is changeable during the Stacker install process. This is
    13	an 8 bit card designed for use on XTs, although one can also use it on
    14	AT machines.  QEMM will need an EXCLUDE for this RANGE.
    15	
    16	For example: if the card uses CC00-CFFF, then add X=CC00-CFFF to the
    17	QEMM device line in the config.sys
    18

    20	I.  Using STACKER 2 with EMS memory and QEMM's Stealth:
    21	
    22	   a) When installing STACKER 2 on a machine with QEMM already
    23	      present.  The STACKER Install program will ask whether or not you
    24	      wish to use EMS.  Selecting yes would add the /EMS switch to the
    25	      Stacker device line.  If you want to use EMS with STACKER 2 and
    26	      QEMM's Stealth option, make sure to add DBF=2 to the QEMM device
    27	      line before installing STACKER 2.  Otherwise the machine will just
    28	      reboot and go into a loop saying that you need to add DBF=2. DBF is
    29	      needed because STACKER 2 is accessing the disk via the page frame,
    30	      and this is not allowed when using Stealth.
    31	
    32	      The only way out of this loop is to REBOOT, then hold down the ALT
    33	      key after you hear a beep.  You will be prompted to press the
    34	      Escape key to unload qemm.  Press escape, then edit the config.sys
    35	      (on the uncompressed drive) and add DBF=2 to the QEMM386.sys device
    36	      line,
    37	
    38	      Device=c:\qemm\qemm386.sys dbf=2
    39	
    40	      IMPORTANT: This change should be done on the uncompressed drive.
    41	
    42	   b) When installing QEMM 6 on a machine with STACKER 2 already
    43	      installed, if you plan to let STACKER 2 use EMS provided by QEMM
    44	      6, make sure to edit the config.sys and add the DBF=2 parameter to
    45	      the QEMM device line in the config.sys.  At the same time, you
    46	      could add /EMS to the Stacker device line to allow it to use EMS.
    47	
    48	II. Running OPTIMIZE with STACKER 2
    49	
    50	   a) How can I make OPTIMIZE work with STACKER?
    51	
    52	      Optimize fails because of the SSWAP.COM driver in the config.sys.
    53	      SSWAP's line in config.sys typically looks like:
    54	
    55	                  DEVICE=C:\STACKER\SSWAP.COM C: D: /SYNC
    56	
    57	      SSWAP.COM is the non-resident program that switches the drive
    58	      letters. In the example above, drive C: becomes drive D: and drive
    59	      D: becomes drive C:. Optimize reboots your machine a few times and
    60	      writes data to the disk during this process. SSWAP.COM will make
    61	      Optimize think it is writing to C when in fact it was writing to D.
    62	
    63	      1. When running Optimize, this device line needs to be either
    64	         remarked or removed temporarily from the CONFIG.SYS.  Also,
    65	         your AUTOEXEC.BAT (and some lines in the config.sys that came
    66	         after SSWAP.COM) probably contains references to drive C:. All
    67	         these references (except for references to files that you know
    68	         exist on both the compressed and uncompressed drive) need to be
    69	         changed to drive D:. Conversely, all references to drive D:
    70	         should be changed to drive C:. This is necessary since Optimize
    71	         requires that the CONFIG.SYS and the AUTOEXEC.BAT reside on
    72	         drive C:.
    73	
    74	      2. When installing STACKER 2 on a machine with QEMM already
    75	         installed, STACKER2 will automatically copy most of the files
    76	         Optimize needs to the \QEMM subdirectory of the boot
    77	         (uncompressed) drive. As of the date of this writing, the
    78	         STACKER2 install program did not copy TESTBIOS.COM (needed for
    79	         STEALTH testing) and WINSTLTH.VXD (needed for Windows enhanced
    80	         mode if using STEALTH).  This means that you have to copy the
    81	         TESTBIOS.COM and WINSTLTH.VXD from the compressed drive to the
    82	         uncompressed \QEMM subdirectory. Go to step 4...
    83	
    84	      3. When installing QEMM on an existing STACKER drive, create a
    85	         QEMM sub-directory on the uncompressed drive. (That is C: since
    86	         we already REMOVED SSWAP.COM in step 1.) Some files need to be
    87	         in the QEMM sub-directory in order to run Optimize properly:
    88	         QEMM386.SYS, OPTIMIZE.COM, LOADHI.SYS, TESTBIOS.COM,
    89	         LOADHI.COM, BUFFERS.COM, RSTRCFG.SYS, MCA.ADL (if
    90	         you are running on a microchannel machine), WINHIRAM.VXD and
    91	         WINSTLTH.VXD (if using Windows 3 enhanced mode)
    92	
    93	      4. Once you have done this, you should reboot before running
    94	         Optimize so that the drives are set up correctly.  Now you
    95	         should be able to run Optimize normally.  After Optimize has
    96	         run, you should edit your CONFIG.SYS and restore the SSWAP.COM
    97	         line.  Also, you should edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT to restore the
    98	         drive specifications to what they were before; e.g. change all
    99	         references to drive D: to drive C: and all references to drive
   100	         C: to drive D:.  Reboot again.  You are now getting the most
   101	         out of your conventional memory.
