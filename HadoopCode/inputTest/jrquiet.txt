     1	Silencing the noisy PCjr disk drive is as easy as lubricating two rods
     2	inside your computer. The drive head carriage hangs on two rods and
     3	sometimes hangs up, causing the noise. The rods are lubricated with Silicone
     4	grease or Teflon oil. Radio Shack sells the Teflon oil as "Pecision Oiler".
     5	Machine oil (3-in-One) is ok, but may cause some corrosion and generally
     6	won't last as long. One final caution- Don't touch or get any lubricant
     7	on the drive heads themselves.
