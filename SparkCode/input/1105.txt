    13	Description:
    14	        In order to install DR DOS you must make sure that you are
    15	        booting from a floppy in drive A:. DR DOS will not install
    16	        from drive B:. DR DOS comes on 3 1/2 inch low density
    17	        floppies and 5 1/4 inch Hi-density floppies. If you need
    18	        5 1/4 inch low-density disks (360K) send in the coupon that
    19	        comes with your DR DOS.
    20	
    21	        If the boot disk hangs while trying to load, usually it means
    22	        there is an incompatible or faulty piece of hardware.
    23	
    24		One of the things it can be is simply an older floppy 
    25		drive that is out of alignment.  Sometimes the situation
    26		can be salvaged by formatting a floppy on the boot drive
    27		with the old DOS, then doing a diskcopy. The potential 
    28		problem is that the diskcopy may not be able to read the 
    29		boot disk either. If you can't make a backup then it may 
    30		be necessary to get a replacement disk set from Digital
    31		Research (in case there is an actual error with the disk,
    32		which does sometime happen) or see about getting the 
    33		drives aligned.

    37		Another problem is where you can make valid Diskcopies 
    38		but all you get is the message "Loading...". Here the
    39		potential problem may be the computer's bios. DR DOS 
    40		must be able to direct the system to the area where DOS 
    41		Kernel files are located. Older bioses are not able to 
    42		perform this function. If your bios dates from around
    43		1987 or earlier you may need an update.

    47		And finally, if you can read the disks but are unable to 
    48		format a disk or make a diskcopy DR DOS may think you 
    49		have a different type of floppy than you actually have.
    50		Another symptom of this is if you are making a floppy
    51		installation and DR DOS asks you for 5 1/4" floppies
    52		when you actually have 3 1/2" floppies. If this is an XT
    53	        type computer (by which we mean it has no CMOS config-
    54		uration program) then you can place a DRIVPARM state-
    55		ment in your CONFIG.SYS. Refer to the DR DOS manual to
    56		see how to use this parameter. DRIVPARM uses no RAM. It
    57		merely updates the DR DOS drive tables with the type
    58		drive you specify. If your computer does have a CMOS 
    59		setup program then you need to correct the entries for
    60	        your floppy drives in CMOS.
