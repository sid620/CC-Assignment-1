     5	Computer-based, voice-controlled robots can enhance the quality of life for a
     6	person with high-level quadriplegia, particularly with an injury above the 
     7	level of C-5 to C-6.  Using robots can provide greater control over a person's
     8	physical environment, expand avocational and vocational horizons, reduce the
     9	expense of attendant care, and improve self-esteem.

    11	Rehabilitation robotics began evolving in the early 1960s with Case Institute
    12	of Technology's (Cleveland) computerized orthoses.  In the early 1970s, the 
    13	University of Heidelberg developed an industrial manipulator and minicomputer
    14	through which a keyboard controlled by a telephone, typewriter, or a custom 
    15	mouth-stick could be used for vocational purposes by handicapped persons.
    16	In 1981 the Johns Hopkins University's applied physics laboratory designed 
    17	more advanced robotic system permitting perprogrammed manipulation sequences 
    18	for tasks such as retrieving books and serving food.  The French Spartacus 
    19	robotic aid made other contributions to the evolution of the field of robotics.

    21	During the past eight years, the Stanford University and the Veterans 
    22	Administration Rehabilitation Engineering and Research Center, in collaboration
    23	with the Spinal Cord Injury Center, have explored through a number of projects 
    24	the potential use of robots as assisting devices for severely disabled persons.
    25	A wide range of users successfully commanded a robot to perform preprogrammed 
    26	self-care tasks such as providing drinking water, grooming the hair, brushing 
    27	teeth, and cleaning t#e face.  A third-generation desktop robotic assistant 
    28	has already been developed and clinically evaluated for persons with high 
    29	level quadriplegia.  Advances in speech-recognition technology and commercial 
    30	computer hardware and software have significantly augmented the uses of the 
    31	system PUMA-260 robot manipulator.  Efforts are currently being directed to 
    32	develop a desktop system that would be useful for a skilled computer scientist
    33	in an office setting.  The most recent developments in progress include a 
    34	controlled mobile manipulator consisting of a commercial robotic arm equipped
    35	with sensors and mounted on an omnidirectional vehicle, useful to a handi-
    36	capped person confined to a bed or wheelchair.
    37	
    38	Ordinarily no knowledge of computer programming in required to operate the 
    39	robotic arm; the on-board microprocessor is preprogrammed by a therapist to
    40	perform complex tasks in response to one or two commands from the user.
