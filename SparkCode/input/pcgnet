    15	All I can say about the August issue is that I'm VERY dissapointed...           
    16	<sob!>. The First issue was great, Robert! Then you started adding all          
    17	those stupid pic's and stuff... they make it look nice, but the greatly         
    18	increase the size of the gazzette and make it impractical for modem             
    19	transfer. And then with this last READER with all its bugs... it looks          
    20	downright horrible... and the fact that you have to run the stupid batch        
    21	file first to get it to work... dischipccable! I think you're going to          
    22	HAVE to get some competition to get you back in fighting shape!! Let's 
    23	have a nice, clean, fast issue like the 2nd or 3rd (The first one was a
    24	little slow...). The scroll thing on the new one is OK, but I prefer the 
    25	old method of reading... With the old issues, I'd call a new board 
    26	anywhere in the country, and they would be there. These days, I haven't
    27	even seen PCGAZ106.ARC in many of the local boards! It's a real 
    28	disgrace, Robert... let's get rid of the cutsie pics and such, and make
    29	it fast, nice, and small. I hope this does you some good, Robert, and 
    30	doesn't just get you embarassed or pissed at me. I'm REALLY 
    31	dissapointed... 
    32	hope the ol' Gaz shapes up...!

    59	Robert,
    60	  Hi! I just got the August issue of PC-Gazzette out here in NY, and 
    61	it's great!  I am putting together a Disk Magazine aimed at people 
    62	involved in the stock market -- a tock market newsletter on disk, and I
    63	want to know if there is any documentation, etc. for the READER program
    64	so I could make my own newsletter?  Also, does READER automatically 
    65	change the screens from color (if thats the way the screen was 
    66	originally made) to black & white?
    67	 
    68	  Well, that's it, and keep up the great work!

    79	Thanks for the nice comments. I am getting together some notes on the 
    80	READER program for those who would like them. More on that later. The 
    81	only trouble is, it is in a constant state of update. The last (3.0) was 
    82	full of bugs and disappointed a number of people. 
    83	  
    84	As for the conversion from color to b&w, yes the program strips out the
    85	color from the screens. They were made originally made in color.

    94	FIRST OF ALL, I THINK PC-GAZZETTE IS GREAT!
    95	THE METHOD OF DISPLAY AND ISSUE CONTENTS HAVE BEEN
    96	FANTASTIC.
    97	  
    98	...BUT,
    99	WHEN I READ THE AUGUST ISSUE USING READER 3.0
   100	I WAS DISSAPOINTED.
   101	 
   102	I LIKE THE IDEA OF SCROLLING FOR THE REST OF A 
   103	STORY, BUT READER 3.0 ADDED A CONFUSING SET OF
   104	KEYBOARD COMMANDS TO THE PREVIOUSLY STRAIGHT-
   105	FORWARD SET OF COMMANDS.
   106	 
   107	AT FIRST, I COULDNT GET SCROLLING AT ALL, THEN
   108	I WOULD SCROLL FOR AWHILE, AND ACCIDENTLY USE
   109	PAGE DOWN THINKING IT WOULD SCROLL DOWN FASTER.
   110	OF COURSE, PAGE DOWN WENT TO THE NEXT STORY.
   111	IN GENERAL, READER 3.0 IS FAR TOO CONFUSING 
   112	TO USE.  TOO MANY KEYBOARD COMMANDS.
   113	MOST ARE NOT EASY TO REMEMBER, OR INTUITIVE.
   114	AGAIN, I LIKE SCROLLING STORIES, BUT CANT YOU
   115	MAKE THE KEYSTROKES SIMPLER?
   116	 
   117	I DON'T LIKE TO COMPLAIN, ESPECIALLY SINCE I
   118	THINK PC-GAZETTE IS GREAT.  I JUST HATE TO SEE
   119	THE READER PROGRAM BECOME SO COMPLEX AND HARD
   120	TO USE.
   121	 
   122	KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK, PEOPLE ARE READING 
   123	YOUR ISSUES.

   130	ok, I finally downloaded a copy of the gazette, since I finally found a
   131	local (to me) bbs that has it available. But I have a few questions:
   132	What is Gallery? was this some utility available in a back issue? if so, 
   133	you better provide it in a separate ARC file so new issues that have 
   134	gallery pictures can read them.
   135	I also agree that we need the docs for TA. it is completely useless 
   136	without documentation. 
   137	also, I must remark that I didn't find a single item of interest in the
   138	june (or was it july) issue. Shouldn't you consider the content of the 
   139	magazine a little more closely? If you get lost in the format of the 
   140	magazine, the content suffers. For example, a half page of graphics to 
   141	announce that a Syntax's column will not appear this month??
   142	As a professional in publication and typesetting, I have to tell you one 
   143	basic fact: Format must be subservient to content. Jazzy graphics cant 
   144	help a bit if you don't have anything to say of interest. If you just 
   145	want to produce neat graphics programs, go for it! But don't advertise 
   146	it as a magazine. With this, I go to download the current issue. Hope 
   147	there's more content in this one....

   154	I just spent 15 minutes downloading the new gazette so I could learn 
   155	such interesting things as: The correct spelling of platypus (by the 
   156	way, plural is platypi not platypuses), and that the compaq 286 is 
   157	faster than the ibm? Come on! This stuff isnt worth downloading, let 
   158	alone the trouble it takes to set it into the reader format.
   159	To paraphrase Winston Churchill, "Never has so much been done by so few
   160	for so little a result"...
   161	Get it together, guys! If you don't have anything interesting to say, 
   162	you can always find something more interesting (like a page from the 
   163	phone book)...
   164	Sorry if this is harsh, but I invite your rebuttal. Maybe you ought to 
   165	take a closer look at this job. For example look at the Databoard:
   166	ATDT766-6442
   167	(sorry that was from my dialer) its in the 818 area code; they do an 
   168	excellent job preparing interesting and useful data.
   169	I wish you luck with your gazette, but you better get it together fast.
   170	Nothing is more fickle than an audience. You will have to work hard to 
   171	keep yours.

   178	Wow!  Those guys hit real hard.  I think they are being sincere, though. 
   179	They want you to be successful and offer their comments to try and 
   180	assist you with an objective view of what you are doing.  I hope that 
   181	you don't get discouraged by them though.  Maybe you need to collaborate 
   182	with others to get material of greater interest.  There is material you
   183	might want to check out at a MICROLINK user group meeting.  We have some 
   184	information from IBM, members with expertize in writing composition, 
   185	various program demonstrations that might look good reported in print 
   186	and other topics that might interest the computing public at large.
   187	 
   188	If we at MICROLINK can be of any assistance to you in keeping this 
   189	unique and superior product continuing, then don't hesitate to call on 
   190	us.  This is one of the reason's we formed the user group.  There are a
   191	lot of other benefits, too, but support of the computer user is still 
   192	the main priority.
   193	 
   194	Keep up the great work and don't be put off by what is offered as 
   195	constructive criticism.  This is a learning process for all of us.

   214	First off, recheck your dictionary for the correct plural of platypus. 
   215	My dictionary uses both spellings and it's a normal type dictionary. 
   216	Even if it wasn't proper, the writer used it in a area that didn't 
   217	require such accuracy. It was in an article on nonsense, remember?
   218	  
   219	The articles are submitted by various persons and if during a month none 
   220	of those contributed seem interesting, we are sorry. Maybe our type of 
   221	media is not your cup of tea. But, hopefully, you will find something in 
   222	the upcoming issues. The August issue was large and complex and 
   223	confusing and full of bugs. No excuses. The September issue will go back 
   224	to some of the things that made the eariler issues nice. I will still 
   225	have scrolling but with simpler commands. 
   226	  
   227	I think you might be able to help us get the Gazette "together". If you
   228	can formulate your dissatifactions so eloquently and certainly get your
   229	point across, we would sure like to read an article written by you. How
   230	about it? Could you help us? Most of us claim no great journalistic 
   231	skills (I'm a layout person myself and it's enough to just come up with
   232	the Ramblings). Please don't get me wrong. This is not a challenge. Just 
   233	a request. If a person sees a better way and can do something about it,
   234	then maybe he should. Soapbox handed over for further discussion... 
   235	Thanks for comments. They were enlightening.....Robert

   242	Thanks for the support. I would love to come to your meetings. 
   243	Unfortunely, they are on at a time I devote to my family. Priorities and 
   244	such, I normally won't be able to make it. One of these days I will try
   245	and come.
   246	  
   247	I am not put off by the comments. But hopefully these guys will accept 
   248	any positive changes or even help out by contributing to the content of
   249	the Gazette. One thing many people don't realize is that everything in 
   250	the Gazette is contributed and done without any reimbursement. Hey the
   251	Gazette is free, remember. It also requires time on all the authors' 
   252	parts as well as my own. Some issue will have a lot of great articles 
   253	and some may not (a lot, that is.). But over all, I think that the 
   254	Gazette has been received as a good thing. We listen to the criticism 
   255	and will try to improve the quality of the mag. If there are better 
   256	writers, then let them write. Let's make the Gazette better. The opening 
   257	words on it are "A User-supported Newsletter". I hope to keep it that 
   258	way: by listening to suggestions and by publishing the best CONTRIBUTED
   259	articles each month.
   260	  
   261	Don't judge August's issue as the wave of the future. The September 
   262	issue will get back to basics. It will be tighter and smaller. It won't
   263	take up your precious download time like the last couple.
   264	  
   265	Hope you like the changes. We DO listen....Robert

   284	No, I wouldn't make remarks like that if I wasn't prepared to back em 
   285	up. I would be glad to write a short article for the gazette, but time 
   286	will be a little tight (isn't it always?) for the near future, due to me 
   287	just quitting my job at Computerland. I'm sure I have a lot to say, 
   288	especially since I've been in microcomputers since before the Apple I.
   289	The question is, what is the audience, and what do they want to read?
   290	If this is a magazine for all the BBS hacker kiddies, I don't know what
   291	they're into (maybe a review of my new skateboard). I don't think there
   292	is much of an audience for C programming either, anyone into C already 
   293	has their own sources of info, I'm sure. Somewhere inbetween is a happy
   294	medium. I think its about time for an audience survey of some kind..
   295	This would be kind of hard, since PCgaz will drift around the country 
   296	like all DNloads do. 
   297	Let me know if you have any suggestions for articles or topics of 
   298	interest to the readers.
   299	p.s. I thought the new reader is really hard to use. It would be more 
   300	logical to use Ctrl-Pgdn for changing chapters and pgdn for flipping 
   301	pages instead of your vice versa arrangement. Most programs use PgDn in
   302	this fashion, using Ctrl-PgDn for an "Amplified" pgdn of some sort.
   303	P.P.S. you havent got the new gazette listed in the dnload files section 
   304	yet...

   311	Glad to hear you would help out. I will probably open the future 
   312	directions to the readers in a survey with the Sept issue. The Sept 
   313	issue is not out if that's the one you refer to. 
   314	  
   315	Yes version 3.0 is(was) a mess!!! I rewrote the scrolling routine and it 
   316	uses the natural keys of up,down,pgdn,pgup,home, end. Also it will be 
   317	back to double columns on most pages. So the scroll will be for full 
   318	page and individual columns. The thought of Ctrl-PgDn for changing 
   319	sections is one I hadn't thought of. Maybe.... I glad to hear from you 
   320	and welcome any improvements to the mag. It gets hard to be objective 
   321	when it's your baby. That's what this conference is for: Keeping us on 
   322	our toes....Be talking to you...Robert

   329	Your doing a great job, Robert.  Keep up the good work and I think your
   330	requests for article submission is a terrific idea.  It's amazing how we 
   331	take a free product and pick it apart, demanding more from the 
   332	originator than we should.  Yours is not the only item to which I am 
   333	refering (take a look at the ZIP conference on the Diamond Bar BBS and 
   334	see what they do to Ed Dong).
   335	 
   336	We should be grateful and less critical to the people who utilize their
   337	time to give us such wonderful computer programs.  I didn't see the 
   338	August issue of the GAZETTE but I know the quality that is attempted by
   339	the producer.  I am glad he goes to such effort on my part to bring me a 
   340	unique way of spreading information.
   341	 
   342	Now let's hear more support for our editor and suggestions for 
   343	improvement stated in a thankful tone (or else in a "Receiver Only" 
   344	message).   Nuff said...........................JAY

   351	Hey, if the product is getting stale, the maker should be told about it. 
   352	Of course everyone likes to told his creation is the greatest thing 
   353	since seedless watermelons but usually it isn't. The Gazette depends on
   354	user/reader feedback in order to keep fresh and lively. Starting with 
   355	the Sept. issue there will be a section called "The I/O Port" which will 
   356	be exactly that: input and output between PC users. This board and 
   357	others will be supporting a simple network that will provide lively 
   358	discussion between users. Selected portions of these messages will be 
   359	published in each issue. Hopefully this endeavour will be supported.
   360	  
   361	Anyway, thanks again for your support....Robert

   368	Jay,
   369	    I'm sorry, but I must go against your will and say one more thing. 
   370	My last message was definately out of my uncalm and uncollective self, 
   371	but I meant it.  I would like to further one of your points about 
   372	"demanding more from the originator".  It is the many messages of hard 
   373	core non-sence to the others that contain resonable suggestions that 
   374	make all the public domain programs what they are.  If people were not 
   375	open about what they felt about a certain software package, how would th 
   376	e originator know what the heak the end user wants?  I'm glad they we 
   377	have this thing called the Public Domain.  Let's utilize it for the 
   378	benefit of all of us, and continue to support those who support it.
   379	 
   380	                                         Dave.

   387	OK already! I once again forgot, that we sometimes state things more 
   388	forcefully through these mediums, including gripes, so they can be blown 
   389	out of proportion.. Sorry for blowing off some steam, but I think we are 
   390	all frustrated at the amount of time and effort it takes to do things 
   391	like the gazette, or write articles, or set up and collate all that 
   392	material. I certainly would like to see more and fatter gazettes, with a 
   393	surplus of articles & etc contributed by the public. To start things 
   394	rolling, I will contribute some article & etc. info.

   401	Thanks for the validation! Now I think I'll return to the bloodshed in 
   402	the Gazette conference and see how Robert Flores is holding up...
   403	Things seem to get a little hot over there, but that's a sign of a 
   404	need conference, I suppose.   Later!  -Bob L.
