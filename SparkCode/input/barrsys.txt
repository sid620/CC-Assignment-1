     1	(GAINESVILLE, FL -- February 11, 1992) Barr Systems announced that its SNA
     2	RJE and 3270 gateways now support access from workstations with
     3	asynchronous modems. The feature allows laptops, notebook computers, and
     4	other PCs with inexpensive, internal, asynchronous modems to gain dial-up
     5	access to mainframes.
     6	
     7	Asynchronous access to the BARR/GATE gateway is provided by the four PC COM
     8	ports, and up to four of Barr's new 8-port ASYNC8 adapter boards, for a
     9	total of up to 36 ports. Using COM1 through COM4 with internal
    10	asynchronous modems provides a very clean and inexpensive solution. This
    11	configuration can support a large number of occasional dial-up users. The
    12	same gateway can also simultaneously support up to 254 total users on a
    13	LAN using NetBlOS, Novell IPX/SPX, or 802.2 Token Ring protocols.
    14	
    15	The ASYNC option supports the IBM-standard Asynchronous Data Link Control
    16	(ADLC) protocol, which provides access to the IBM Information Network, and
    17	allows the gateway to support both IBM and Attachmate 3270 asynchronous
    18	workstations. All of the advantages of the SNA architecture are provided,
    19	including error detection and correction, multiple sessions, IND$FILE
    20	transfer, HLLAPI support, and even optional RJE.
    21	
    22	Asynchronous modems supporting the V.42 bis compression standard can
    23	provide dial-up access at up to 38.4 kbps. This is much faster than
    24	existing synchronous dial-up solutions. Barr Systems products also support
    25	full duplex communications. This improves performance even during one-way
    26	transfers because the required acknowledgements are sent simultaneously.
    27	
    28	The ASYNC option to BARR/GATE sells for $690, and supports up to four ports
    29	using internal PC hardware. Up to four ASYNC8 eight-port adapters may be
    30	added to the gateway for $1,290 each. Remote workstations require Barr's
    31	3270/ASYNC, with a list price of $200 per workstation, or compatible
    32	software.
    33	
    34	Barr Systems, Inc. offers a complete line of PC-based host connectivity
    35	products, supporting high-volume printing and file transfer via RJE and
    36	3270 protocols.

    40	(GAINESVILLE, FL -- February 11, 1992) Barr Systems announced that its
    41	remote mainframe communications products now support host connection using
    42	the Qualified Logical Link Control (QLLC) protocol to send SNA over X.25
    43	networks. The X.25 link can greatly reduce access costs by eliminating
    44	long-distance telephone charges.
    45	
    46	Support for X.25 attachment has been added to the existing BARR/SNA RJE,
    47	RJE+3270, BARR/GATE, and BARR/3270 products. These were previously
    48	available with SNA/SDLC, Token Ring, and coaxial (DFT and 3299)
    49	connections. The X.25/QLLC connection operates over Barr's existing
    50	RS-232, V.35, and X.21 adapters, or with Barr's PC-SYNC internal
    51	synchronous modems. There is no additional charge for the X.25/QLLC
    52	software.
    53	
    54	President Tony Barr notes, "We intend to support the full spectrum of IBM
    55	connectivity. The X.25 option is an excellent choice for any RJE or 3270
    56	environment where the per-packet charges would be lower than long-distance
    57	or dedicated line fees." In the Barr Systems implementation, packet costs
    58	have been minimized by eliminating all unnecessary SNA frames, and by
    59	automatically adjusting packet and window sizes to reduce segmentation of
    60	messages.
    61	
    62	The X.25 connection to the host is via the NCP Packet Switching Interface
    63	(NPSI), supported by IBM. Barr's SDLC and X.25 communications options
    64	support line speeds of up to 384 kbps. In addition, they support
    65	full-duplex (DATMODE=FULL) operation, which can nearly double the
    66	throughput provided by competing products.
    67	
    68	Barr Systems, Inc. offers a complete line of PC-based host connectivity
    69	products, supporting high-volume printing and file transfer via RJE and
    70	3270 protocols.
