     1	BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS, FEBRUARY 10,1992 -- Expandable Software, Inc., a
     2	market leader of integrated factory and financial management software on
     3	PC-LANs, today announced its new release 4.4. Over sixty new features were
     4	incorporated. Major ease of use enhancements include pop-up help (user
     5	modifiable) with point-and-shoot selection of valid values, hot-keys jump
     6	users to other related programs or inquires from any prompt, and over 100+
     7	drill-down inquires. The new release also supports companies requiring
     8	sales and financial reporting by product line. This release will be
     9	provided free to all Expandable/MRP users under their standard maintenance
    10	contract.
    11	
    12	Release 4.4 also includes a major new module, Lot Tracking. This
    13	significant addition to the Expandable/MRP system lists for $3,000. Aimed
    14	at companies that require part traceability where material must be tracked
    15	by lot number, batch number, or serial number, the Lot Tracking module
    16	provides complete tracking of a part and its lot/serial number information
    17	from the time it is purchased or manufactured until it is consumed or
    18	shipped. Features include traceability of parts as they are received,
    19	cycle counted, kit issued to work orders or jobs, backflush issued,
    20	completed and or shipped.
    21	
    22	Marshall Guile, president and CEO of Expandable Software said, '"The new
    23	Lot Tracking module provides optimum downward (lot source) and upward (lot
    24	consumption) traceability required by companies with either FDA or serial
    25	number traceability requirements. Lot Tracking also provides capabilities
    26	to help a firm improve its quality control and save a firm unnecessary
    27	write-offs because of lot expiration date control."
    28	
    29	The Expandable/MRP system manages manufacturing (MRP II), financial, and
    30	order management information for manufacturing companies. Feature rich and
    31	completely integrated, it employs fourth-generation relational data base
    32	technology and runs on IBM's AIX and in a variety of PC/LAN environments.
    33	Because Expandable/MRP is an open-ended, total solution for manufacturing
    34	management, --- and one that combines affordability with great power --,
    35	the Expandable system on AIX and LANs has emerged as the premier
    36	manufacturing software product of the 90s.
