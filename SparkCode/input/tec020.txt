    10	STACKER works great on an IBM PS/1.  However, There are a few things
    11	you must do before and after installing STACKER on an IBM PS/1.  The
    12	following step-by-step procedure will prepare your PS/1 for STACKER:
    13	
    14	Procedure:
    15	Note: Step 1 is recommended, but not required.
    16	
    17	1. Start IBM DOS from the 4th quadrant screen.  Click on "Backup and
    18	Restore Your Fixed Disk" and press <Enter>.  Follow the prompts that
    19	you are given to backup all of the files on your fixed disk.
    20	NOTE:  The number of diskettes will vary depending on the amount of
    21	data on your hard disk.
    22	
    23	2. Press <Shift>+<F9> to get to the DOS prompt after completing the
    24	   backup.
    25	
    26	3. Type c:\dos\CUSTOMIZ and press the <Enter> key to setup the system.
    27	   (Customiz can also be run from the IBM DOS quadrant.)
    28	
    29	4. The third line from the bottom of the screen says "Read
    30	   Config.sys:".   Click on "From Disk".
    31	
    32	5. The next line down says "Read Autoexec.bat:".  Click on "From Disk".
    33	
    34	6. The last line says "Disk to read from:".  Click on "C:".
    35	
    36	7. Press <Enter> to save the changes and exit CUSTOMIZ.
    37	
    38	8. Restart your system by pressing <Ctrl>+<Alt>+<Del>.
    39	NOTE:  At this point your computer will boot directly to the DOS
    40	       prompt.
    41	
    42	9. You can now install STACKER by inserting the STACKER diskette and
    43	   typing:   A:INSTALL /B=C 
    44	   At the end of the STACKER install let STACKER reboot
    45	   to access the STACKER drive.  This will again take you to the DOS
    46	   prompt.
    47	
    48	10. To restore the PS/1 system menu, edit the Config.sys on drive C:
    49	    and insert the line: INSTALL=D:\SHELLSTB.COM (STACKER 2.0 users can use
    50	    SEDIT to modify Config.sys.)
    51	
    52	11. Restart the system for changes to take affect.
