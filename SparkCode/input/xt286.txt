     8	           DESCRIPTION
     9	                  A 20 MB fixed disk and a 1.2 MB 5.25" diskette drive are
    10	           standard on the PC XT Model 286.  One additional diskette drive may
    11	           be internally installed as the B drive from the following new
    12	           offerings:
    13	           o   One 3.5" Internal Diskette Drive (mutually exclusive with the
    14	               4865 Model 2, 3.5" External Diskette Drive).
    15	           o   One High Capacity Diskette Drive
    16	           o   One 5.25" 360 KB Diskette Drive
    17	                  New special features further enhance the performance and
    18	           function of the PC XT Model 286.
    19	           3.5" INTERNAL DISKETTE DRIVE
    20	           This feature is a half-high, double-sided, 3.5" diskette drive that
    21	           supports the 3.5" media with 720 KB of storage capacity.  The drive
    22	           utilizes the standard fixed disk and diskette drive adapter provided
    23	           on the PC XT Model 286.  When installed, the drive becomes the "B"
    24	           drive.  Initial Program Loading (IPL) from the 3.5" diskette is not
    25	           supported by the PC XT Model 286.  For operation, DOS users require
    26	           DOS 3.2 on a 5.25" diskette or fixed disk.  The 3.5" Internal
    27	           Diskette Drive is mutually exclusive with the 4865 Model 2, 3.5"
    28	           External Diskette Drive.
    29	           HIGH CAPACITY DISKETTE DRIVE
    30	           The High Capacity Diskette Drive is a half-high, 5.25", dual-sided
    31	           drive with 1.2 MB of storage capacity.  This drive is compatible with
    32	           the standard drive provided with the PC XT Model 286 in the "A"
    33	           position.  When installed as the second drive, the High Capacity
    34	           Diskette Drive becomes the "B" drive.  This drive utilizes the
    35	           standard fixed disk and diskette drive adapter provided on the PC XT
    36	           Model 286.
    37	           5.25" 360 KB DISKETTE DRIVE
    38	           This half-high, 5.25" diskette drive permits the exchange of
    39	           information between the PC XT Model 286 and other members of the IBM
    40	           PC family.  The drive is a dual-sided drive with 360 KB of storage
    41	           capacity.  When installed, the drive becomes the "B" drive.  This
    42	           drive utilizes the standard fixed disk and diskette drive adapter
    43	           provided on the PC XT Model 286.
    44	           SYSTEM PERFORMANCE
    45	           The IBM PC XT Model 286 processor is up to 2.5 times faster
    46	           internally than the prior PC XT family and up to 20 percent faster
    47	           than the Personal Computer AT (R) Model 239, depending upon specific
    48	           applications.
