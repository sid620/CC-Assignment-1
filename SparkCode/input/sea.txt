     4	SEA vs. PKWARE
     5	Shareware Company Threatens BBS World That Gave It Life
     6	  
     7	---------------------------------------------------------
     8	  
     9	  
    10	Last April, System Enhancement Associates, vendors of the archive
    11	utility ARC, filed suit against Phil Katz, author of the archive
    12	programs PKARC and PKXARC, and his company PKWARE.  SEA claimed
    13	trademark infringement on the name "ARC," and violation of their
    14	copyright on the "look and feel" of ARC's command-line user-
    15	interface, in addition to charging Katz with appropriating ARC
    16	program code.
    17	
    18	The company demanded all profits from PKARC and PKXARC, treble
    19	damages, statutory damages at the highest level allowed, and
    20	attorney fees.  It also requested that all copies of PKARC and
    21	PKXARC, from those owned by bulletin board users to those
    22	licensed by businesses, be impounded, and that Katz be barred
    23	from ever again selling or distributing the programs.
    24	  
    25	In August, SEA and PKWARE settled out of court.  SEA obtained the
    26	source code for PKARC and PKXARC, and PKWARE's customer list, and 
    27	Katz was required to pay SEA royalties on the program back to 1985, 
    28	in addition to attorney's fees and legal expenses--an amount that, 
    29	according to documents on file at the Milwaukee County Federal
    30	Courthouse, totals $62,500.
    31	
    32	He also agreed not to use the word "arc" in a trademark sense.  
    33	Under the settlement Katz is permitted to license his PKARC and 
    34	PKXARC programs (or PKPAK and PKUNPAK, as they are now called) from 
    35	SEA until January 31, 1989.  (Anyone who licenses PKPAK and/or
    36	PKUNPAK from Katz prior to then may continue to use those versions
    37	of the program perpetually, even after January 31, 1989.) 
    38	  
    39	Recently SEA filed contempt of court charges against Katz.  While
    40	the company has kept details of their allegations under seal, they
    41	appear to be alleging that any use of the word "arc" by Katz, 
    42	even as a descriptive or generic term (for instance, to refer to the 
    43	act of achiving a file--whether one is using SEA's ARC or ZOO or
    44	any other archiving utility--as "arcing" it) is in violation of the 
    45	settlement.  
    46	
    47	SEA has lately been contacting other software developers whose
    48	products make use of the ARC file format and threatening legal
    49	action.  Gary Conway, author of NARC, an archive extraction
    50	utility, was contacted by the company, which tried to pressure him
    51	to license the ARC format and turn over the source code of NARC.
    52	Don Kinzer of Polytron received a similar call from Thom
    53	Henderson of SEA.  Henderson told Kinzer that if a software
    54	product had the ability to read an ARC file--not create or
    55	extract it, merely read it--SEA would require the vendor to
    56	obtain a license from SEA.
    57	  
    58	Settlement Issues and Rumor Mongering
    59	  
    60	As part of the PKWARE-SEA settlement, both parties agreed to
    61	refrain from any comment on the settlement.  Not surprisingly,
    62	unfounded rumors about the settlement have proliferated.  One
    63	such rumor is that the judge in the PKWARE-SEA case had an outside
    64	consultant compare SEA's and Katz's source code.  When the
    65	consultant found plagiarized code in PKARC, the story goes, Katz
    66	settled quickly to save face.  Not true.  No attorneys for either
    67	SEA or Katz had ever met with the judge prior to the settlement,
    68	and at no time did the judge ever retain an expert or himself see
    69	the source code. 
    70	
    71	The real issues in the case were SEA's charges that Katz had copied
    72	ARC's program code and that he had violated the company's trademark 
    73	on the word "arc."
    74	
    75	In regard to the first complaint, there are only two pieces of
    76	code in ARC with non-trivial algorithm:  the squeeze code and the
    77	crunch code.  SEA copied these almost verbatim from public domain
    78	sources.  Katz's use of the same public domain sources resulted
    79	in a program that ran four times faster than the then current version
    80	of SEA's ARC.  No competent programmer could ever conclude that Katz
    81	had plagiarized SEA code.
    82	  
    83	SEA's claim that it owns a trademark on the word "arc" is, as one
    84	UUCP mail user noted, like Digital Equipment insisting that it
    85	owns the word "equipment."  The word "arc" as an abbreviation for
    86	"archive" has been in the public domain long before either SEA or
    87	PKWARE entered the scene.  Any word which has become a part of
    88	popular parlance, as "arc" has, cannot be protected as a
    89	trademark.
    90	  
    91	Nevertheless, SEA claims that no one else can use this word to
    92	describe their archive utilities, and that Katz used it to
    93	intentionally confuse users and capitalize on the popularity of
    94	SEA's ARC.
    95	  
    96	Finally, SEA claimed in its lawsuit that Katz violated the
    97	copyright on the "look and feel" of ARC's user-interface.  Anyone
    98	who has ever used both ARC and PKARC knows that neither touts an
    99	interface that is anything more than a few commands and switches
   100	entered at the DOS command line.  There are no menus.  There are
   101	no full-screen displays.  There is nothing artistic or seminal in
   102	the interface of either.
   103	  
   104	Yet, SEA argued in its suit that Katz "substantially copied and
   105	plagiarized the entire appearance and user interface and screens
   106	which result when a computer user interacts with or uses [ARC]."
   107	By the same logic the author of Fido bulletin board software may
   108	as well sue the designer of RBBS.
   109	  
   110	(Note:  If you have any questions about the SEA suit, please see
   111	the copy of the complaint filed in that suit which has been
   112	circulating on bulletin boards and on-line services.  A press
   113	statement concerning the settlement is also in circulation.)
   114	
   115	
   116	Why You As a User Should Care
   117	
   118	  
   119	Over the past year the popularity of Katz's PKARC/PKXARC programs
   120	among both bulletin board and business users surpassed that of
   121	SEA's ARC by a wide margin.  Many consider the suit that SEA
   122	waged against PKWARE, as well as the company's subsequent legal
   123	bullying of other shareware archive software developers, as legal
   124	coercion intended solely to drive its competitors out of
   125	business--a tactic not unheard of in the computer industry.
   126	
   127	Defending your software against a suit such as the one filed by
   128	SEA against PKWARE can run from $100,000 into the millions, as
   129	copyright and patent suits are the most costly forms of
   130	litigation to defend against.  If your product is not grossing
   131	over a million in sales, you will be advised (nay, forced by
   132	economics) to seek an early settlement--as Katz did.
   133	  
   134	Consider what this means if you're a Dan Bricklin-type
   135	programmer running a small software operation out of your
   136	home.  The program you slaved over for months so that it might
   137	win you emancipation from your 9-to-5 job, you might be forced to
   138	destroy in a "legal settlement" over a bogus suit.  (Some of us
   139	know people besides Katz to whom this has happened.)
   140	  
   141	Consider what this means if you're a user.  Your choice in
   142	software is being dictated, not by a software package's intrinsic
   143	merits, but legal manipulation.  Legal manipulation that favors
   144	the litigant with the most money as opposed to the one with the
   145	best product.
   146	  
   147	It also means that great programmers are spending their time in
   148	court when they could be busy creating better products for the
   149	marketplace.  Unfortunately, legal experts are predicting an
   150	escalation in such suits over the next decade.
   151	  
   152	
   153	What Can We Do?
   154	  
   155	As a user you can stand up and say that you're not going to put
   156	up with companies that use the courts to strangle their
   157	competition, that employ lawyers and lawsuits to bully companies
   158	and independent programmers out of existence, that dish out
   159	frivolous suits rather than decent products.
   160	  
   161	No, you do not have to take it anymore, and yes, you do have the
   162	power to change things.
   163	  
   164	A number of bulletin board operators, to protest SEA's legal
   165	bullying of its competitors, have stopped using SEA's ARC to
   166	archive programs on their systems.   Some have pulled SEA 
   167	products from their file collections.  We suggest that you 
   168	likewise boycott SEA's ARC, as well as the company's SEADOG 
   169	mail program, until the company desists its harassment of archive 
   170	authors.
   171	  
   172	But boycotts alone are rarely effective.  We also ask that you
   173	write to SEA.  Accompanying this file is a "form letter" to SEA
   174	(in the accompanying file LETTER.TXT) that you can print out, 
   175	sign your name to, and mail.  Feel free to add to or change 
   176	anything in the letter.  
   177	  
   178	In addition, please upload this file and the accompanying file
   179	LETTER.TXT onto any bulletin board or on-line system that you
   180	call.  If you are a sysop who supports this campaign we ask that
   181	you mention it in your board's introductory screen and ask users
   182	to download these files.
   183	  
   184	If enough of us speak up and let it be known that we are opposed
   185	to this kind of misuse of the legal system, we will be sending a
   186	loud message to software vendors that the computer user community
   187	will not tolerate firms that attempt to drive their competitors
   188	out of business through legal harassment.
   189	  
   190	Remember that together we have built the PC community into the
   191	most vibrant computer user community in history, and by uniting
   192	we can make it even better.
