     3	
     4	     BAKERSFIELD, Calif., October 13, 1992 -- Mustang Software, Inc.
     5	(MSI), has introduced QmodemPro, the first communications software
     6	program enabling electronic mail messages to be received and answered
     7	using one integrated program, regardless of the originating E-mail
     8	source.
     9	
    10	     QmodemPro retrieves E-mail, bringing it in to one PC/compatible
    11	environment.  The user no longer needs separate programs to handle MCI
    12	Mail, CompuServe E-mail, BBS messages and other E-mail systems.  In
    13	addition, QmodemPro can redirect the user's replies to any bulletin
    14	board system (BBS), E-mail service or FAX machine -- not just the
    15	original message's source.
    16	
    17	     QmodemPro represents a "rewrite from scratch" of the Qmodem
    18	program, according to Jim Harrer, president/CEO of MSI.  The company
    19	acquired the original Qmodem program from The Forbin Project, Cedar
    20	Falls, Iowa, in October 1991.  The product had attracted a large user
    21	following through its nearly seven years of availability as a shareware
    22	product.
    23	
    24	     "Our goal for Qmodem has always been to produce an outstanding,
    25	mass-merchandized product that could compete on any retail shelf with
    26	the major generic communications programs," Harrer said.  "In addition,
    27	QmodemPro works hand-in-glove with our other retail product line, the
    28	WILDCAT! BBS software."
    29	
    30	Enhanced Off-Line Xpress Mail Reader Heads New Features
    31	
    32	     QmodemPro offers more than 75 new features compared to Qmodem
    33	Version 5, the first version of Qmodem sold under the MSI label,
    34	unveiled this past January.  Heading the list of new features is an
    35	enhanced off-line mail reader.  This capability allows users to
    36	download packets of mail and then read the contents off-line,
    37	significantly reducing expensive long-distance charges.
    38	
    39	     The enhanced off-line mail reader OLX features full mouse support
    40	with pull-down menus and resizable windows.  Other new features include:
    41	
    42	*    Ability to open multiple packets and view multiple conferences at
    43	     once.
    44	
    45	*    No limitations to the size of packets, conferences or message size.
    46	
    47	*    More efficient use of memory resources, including EMS and XMS.
    48	
    49	*    An integrated message editor with spelling checker and 124,000 word
    50	     dictionary.  External editors also supported.
    51	
    52	*    Full cut, copy and paste between messages, conferences and replies,
    53	     even across packets.
    54	
    55	*    Ability to save messages to folders for reading and action at a
    56	     later time.
    57	
    58	*    Internal address book with full links via QmodemPro to CIS, MCI,
    59	     FAX and other services.
    60	
    61	*    Advanced personal mail handling via an IN BOX with automatic
    62	     archiving and configurable purging.  Personal mail no longer
    63	     disappears when a packet is deleted.
    64	
    65	*    Redirection of replies and messages to any location, not just the
    66	     original source system.
    67	
    68	Full mouse support and a pull-down menu interface have also been added
    69	throughout the QmodemPro program.  Other key new features of the
    70	communications software include:
    71	
    72	*    The dialing directory now supports up to 4,095 entries per
    73	     telephone book, with an unlimited number of books.
    74	
    75	*    Ideally suited for working with a BBS, the dialing directory
    76	     now includes support for up to four alternate telephone numbers
    77	     per entry.  This allows the user to automatically try a
    78	     different telephone number if the primary BBS number is busy.
    79	
    80	*    Group-dialing support allows users to group-dial telephone book
    81	     entries as one entry.  When dialing multiple E-mail systems,
    82	     QmodemPro will download mail from one system and automatically
    83	     continue on to the next entry in the group.
    84	
    85	*    Automatic linking between mail packets created in OLX and dialing
    86	     directory entries.  This allows sending all pending replies with a
    87	     single keystroke.
    88	
    89	*    QmodemPro includes send FAX ability, supporting both ASCII and .PCX
    90	     files through any Class 1 or  Class 2 FAX modem.  FAX send
    91	     integrates with OLX completely making it possible to create and
    92	     send a FAX and custom cover sheet by simply typing the message to
    93	     send.
    94	
    95	*    MCI Mail and CompuServe E-mail gateway support, enabling users
    96	     to retrieve or send messages on these popular E-mail accounts.
    97	
    98	*    125 pre-configured modem setups for fast installation.
    99	
   100	     Xmodem and ASCII.  Up to 10 external protocols can be added,
   101	     including bi-directional protocols such as BIMODEM and HSLINK.
   102	
   103	*    Five new terminal emulations have also been added, including
   104	     WYSE 50, DEC VT 102, 220, 320 and TVI 925.
   105	
   106	Direct orders for QmodemPro are being taken effective 10/13/92.  A
   107	specific release date cannot be announced since the manuals and
   108	packaging are still in production.
   109	
   110	The retail price for QmodemPro with Off-Line Xpress is $99, and it will
   111	be available in retail outlets in 6-8 weeks. Orders placed with MSI
   112	direct will be processed as soon as the packaging is complete.  Allow
   113	6-8 week for delivery for all orders.  Orders will be shipped on a

   118	we encourage you to order the one which gives the best pricing
   119	advantage. Only one special price offer is available per registration.

   135	Because the new OLX v3 integrates so well with QmodemPro and has

   147	        update has been mailed.  You must place your order prior to
   148	        November 1 so that we can change our system records before we
   149	        ship your package. After that date you can take a credit for $40
   150	        toward a purchase of QmodemPro (see last offer).
