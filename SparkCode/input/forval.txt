     6	
     7	    Forval's full-duplex IM / SA series of dial-up modems are quality
     8	engineered for super high-speeds.  The IM14400 (Internal) at 14.4 kbps
     9	and the SA14400 (External) at 14.4 kbps are versatile full duplex 
    10	V.32bis / V.42bis modems for personal computers with industry-standard
    11	speeds of 14400 / 12000 / 9600 / 4800 / 2400 / 1200 / 300 bps.
    12	
    13	    These models offer data compression for throughput up to FOUR TIMES
    14	FASTER than the base speed and advanced error correction for exceptional
    15	accuracy.
    16	
    17	    The IM Series is designed to expand its capabilities as your needs
    18	change. With the exclusive " FORVAL-LINK (tm) software, upgrades can be
    19	made in a matter of minutes over the phone line.

    45	  
    46	   INFORMATION:
    47	
    48	   The IM14400 / SA14400 modems comply with the V.32bis standard for 
    49	   data transmission, V.42 error correction and V.42.bis, the newest
    50	   data compression standard. By combining the latest industry standards
    51	   with intelligent engineering, the asynchronous IM14400 / SA14400 
    52	   deliver data at an impressive base speed of 14,400 bps.  And the 
    53	   V.42bis provides a 4:1 data compression ratio with speeds exceeding
    54	   57.6Kbps-transmitting over six times faster than 9600 bps modems.
    55	
    56	   COMPATIBILITY:
    57	
    58	   When connecting with slower modems, the IM14400/SA14400 modems offer
    59	   excellent compatibility and high data performance over a broad range
    60	   of transmission speeds.  Equipped with automatic step-down via CCITT
    61	   standards, the IM14400/SA14400 ensure data transference at the highest
    62	   levels of speed, compression and error correction possible.
    63	
    64	   For custom modem configurations, the IM14400/SA14400 feature user-
    65	   selectable options for setting speed rates, data compression levels
    66	   and error handling methods.
    67	
    68	   SOPHISTICATED ERROR CORRECTION AND HANDLING:
    69	
    70	   When exchanging critical data at accelerated speeds, accuracy is 
    71	   imperative. With the IM14400/SA14400 modems, sophisticated error
    72	   correction and data handling capability, data integrity is preserved
    73	   under the worst line conditions.  The built-in Turbo Interface on the 
    74	   IM14400 provides absolute data integrity at all speeds along with 
    75	   full flow control of remote modems. The SA14400 modem has the optional 
    76	   Turbo Interface Card that can be purchased to provide the same reliability
    77	   as the Internal modem.

   191	
   192	   IM19200 / SA19200 ULTRA HIGH SPEED MODEMS.
   193	
   194	   * Available the early part of this year.
   195	   * Transmission of 21.6Kbps allowing throughput of over 57.6 Kbps with
   196	     data compression.
   197	   * FORVAL LINK (tm) upgrades modem performance over the phone.
   198	   * Advanced error correction for protection of data at all speeds.
   199	   * Compatibility with CCITT dial-up standards
   200	   * Compatibility with the Hayes (tm) "AT" command set and a wide range
   201	     of communications software.
   202	   * SA19200 has the LCD display providing complete insight into modem 
   203	     operations.  Can be positioned horizontally or vertically.
   204	   * 5 Year Warranty
   205	
   206	   
   207	   PERFORMANCE WITHOUT COMPROMISE:
   208	
   209	   The V.42 error correction and V.42bis data compression ensure data
   210	   integrity at any speed. Sophisticated engineering and CCITT standards
   211	   are built into the modems. The modems automatically negotiate CCITT
   212	   standards when connecting with slower modems at fall-back speeds 
   213	   ranging from 14400, 12000, 9600, 4800, 2400, 1200 to 300 bps. You can
   214	   also set these levels manually.
   215	
   216	   UPGRADES ARE JUST A PHONE CALL AWAY:
   217	
   218	   With FORVAL-LINK (tm) software and a phone call to our headquarters,
   219	   you can upgrade your modem instantly and maintain the technological
   220	   edge.  Costly obsolescence is virtually eliminated.
   221	
   222	   SA19200 MODEMS
   223	
   224	   Like all Forval stand-alone modems, the SA19200 can be adapted with a
   225	   bookend base for use as a slimline tower.  When desktop space is at a
   226	   premium, this tower configuration has a footprint of only 16 square 
   227	   inches.  Of course, you can also set it in the standard horizontal
   228	   position.

   244	
   245	   INFORMATION:
   246	
   247	 
   248	    The IM19200/SA19200 modems will be a proprietary speed, however when 
   249	    the CCITT approves a 19.2 Kbps, this modem will be able to be configured
   250	    via the FORVAL-LINK (tm) to be fully compatible with the new standard.
   251	    Which means that when the standard is approved, this modem will not be
   252	    obsolete. 
   253	    
   254	    The IM14400/SA14400 modems are also fully capabable of being upgraded
   255	    via the FORVAL-LINK (tm) to make them fully compatible at the 19.2 Kbps
   256	    speeds. 
   257	
   258	    All these modems will also be able to be upgraded in the later part of 
   259	    this year to have FAX capabilities. Again by use of the FORVAL-LINK (tm)
   260
