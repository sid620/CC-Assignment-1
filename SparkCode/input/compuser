     4	Re:   Copyright: The Gospel according to CompuServe! (Their position)
     5	
     6	--WHAT IS A COMPILATION COPYRIGHT?
     7	
     8	     CompuServe has copyrighted the contents of the CompuServe
     9	Information Service as a compilation copyright, just as many magazines
    10	and newspapers reserve such a copyright on the contents of their
    11	publications.  This copyright is held in accordance with the 1976
    12	Copyright Act of the United States.
    13	
    14	     A compilation copyright is granted when an organization collects
    15	information in a lawful way, adds value to it, and offers it to
    16	others. In this case, the CompuServe Information Service is a
    17	value-added product; CompuServe Incorporated has committed substantial
    18	financial resources to collecting more than 400 databases and offering
    19	them in an organized, structured way to a defined user base through a
    20	nationwide telecommunications network.  The compilation copyright is
    21	intended to protect that substantial investment from unauthorized
    22	exploitation.  This does NOT mean that CompuServe assumes ownership of
    23	individual programs and databases provided to the system by
    24	subscribers or information providers.
    25	
    26	--IF I UPLOAD A SOFTWARE PROGRAM I'VE DEVELOPED TO COMPUSERVE, DO 
    27	I STILL RETAIN OWNERSHIP OF THE PROGRAM?
    28	
    29	     Yes, you do.  CompuServe's compilation copyright does NOT
    30	supercede individual ownership rights or copyrights to any of the
    31	material furnished to the Service by subscribers or information
    32	providers.
    33	
    34	     For example, a subscriber who creates a program and uploads it to
    35	a CompuServe forum data library STILL OWNS that program, and may
    36	upload it to other information services and bulletin board systems.
    37	
    38	     It should be noted, however, that CompuServe cannot grant any
    39	redistribution rights for materials copyrighted by the author, unless
    40	specifically authorized to do so, CompuServe does not own the material
    41	or the copyright.  These rights must be obtained directly from the
    42	author.
    43	
    44	--WHAT IS COMPUSERVE'S STANCE TOWARD COPYRIGHTED, PUBLIC DOMAIN, AND
    45	SHAREWARE PROGRAMS?
    46	
    47	     Each of these types of property have special characteristics, and
    48	deserves separate explanation:
    49	
    50	COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL
    51	
    52	     CompuServe does not allow copyrighted material to be placed on
    53	the CompuServe Information Service without the author's permission.
    54	Only the owner(s) or persons they specifically authorize may upload
    55	copyrighted material to the Service.
    56	     Any subscriber may download copyrighted material for their own
    57	use. Any subscriber may also non-commercially redistribute a
    58	copyrighted program with the expressed permission of the owner or
    59	authorized person. Permission must be specified in the document, on
    60	the Service, or must be obtained directly from the author. See menu
    61	choices 5,6 and 7 for more information about redistribution
    62	guidelines.
    63	
    64	PUBLIC DOMAIN
    65	
    66	    Any subscriber may upload public domain programs to the Service.
    67	Any subscriber may download public domain programs for their own use
    68	or non-commercially redistribute a public domain program.  See menu
    69	choices 5, 6, and 7 for more information about redistribution
    70	guidelines.
    71	
    72	SHAREWARE
    73	
    74	     Only the owner or an authorized person may upload shareware
    75	programs.
    76	  Any subscriber may download shareware programs for their own use,
    77	subject to the terms provided by the owner.  Any subscriber may
    78	non-commercially redistribute a shareware program subject to the
    79	provided terms explicitly displayed in the software itself, or with
    80	permission of the owner or authorized person.  See menu choices 5, 6
    81	and 7 for more information about redistribution guidelines.
    82	
    83	--AS A COMPUSERVE SUBSCRIBER, CAN I DOWNLOAD PUBLIC DOMAIN INFORMATION
    84	AND SHAREWARE PROGRAMS FOR MY OWN USE FROM COMPUSERVE FORUM DATA
    85	LIBRARIES?
    86	
    87	     Yes, you can.  Public domain information and shareware programs
    88	are uploaded to CompuServe data libraries by their authors for use by
    89	other CompuServe subscribers.
    90	
    91	--MAY I DOWNLOAD PROGRAMS FROM COMPUSERVE FORUM DATA LIBRARIES AND
    92	SHARE THEM WITH A FRIEND, OR UPLOAD THEM TO ANOTHER BULLETIN BOARD
    93	SYSTEM?
    94	
    95	     In keeping with the spirit of the development of public domain
    96	information and shareware, it is not CompuServe's current policy to
    97	prevent casual redistribution of this type of information -- this is
    98	low volume and low frequency use or redistribution of information
    99	where no commercialism is involved.  This means that a customer may
   100	download a file and share it with others for no commercial gain --
   101	either via a bulletin board service, diskette, or other means.
   102	     A subscriber may not, however, download a large number of files
   103	for redistribution via any means, nor is it acceptable for a
   104	subscriber to update another bulletin board regularly with files
   105	obtained from CompuServe.
   106	     It's important to note that CompuServe cannot grant
   107	redistribution rights for programs clearly copyrighted by the author,
   108	unless specifically authorized to do so. Such permssion must be
   109	obtained directly from the author of the program.
   110	
   111	--MAY I DOWNLOAD AND RESELL A PROGRAM FROM A COMPUSERVE FORUM DATA
   112	LIBRARY?
   113	
   114	     Commercial exploitation of material contained on the CompuServe
   115	Information Service is specifically prohibited by the CompuServe
   116	Service agreement, to which each subscriber agrees before being
   117	permitted to access the Service.  Therefore, subscribers cannot
   118	lawfully download and redistribute public information or shareware
   119	programs for personal gain.
   120	     In addition, mass redistribution of public domain information or
   121	shareware is also prohibited.  Mass distribution is defined as high
   122	frequency and/or high volume transfers.
   123	
   124	--WHAT ARE THE PENALTIES FOR VIOLATING THE COMPILATION COPYRIGHT OR
   125	SERVICE AGREEMENT PROVISIONS?
   126	
   127	     When a situation involving exploitation is brought to
   128	CompuServe's attention, we investigate and, if warranted, remind the
   129	violator of the terms of the Service Agreement.  If subsequent
   130	violations are reported, access to the CompuServe Information Service
   131	may be terminated for the violator and, in extreme cases, a letter is
   132	sent from our legal counsel asking that he or she cease and desist, or
   133	risk further legal action.
   134	     This is done as a positive step to protect the value and use of
   135	the material for CompuServe Information Service subscribers, and to
   136	discourage unauthorized redistribution of that material.  
   137	
   138	1.  The CompuServe Information Service (the "Service") consists of the
   139	use of the computing services, software and databases so designated by
   140	CompuServe. These Terms and any Operating Rules published over the
   141	Service constitute the entire Agreement for the Service and supersede
   142	all prior and contemporaneous statements, communications and
   143	documents.
   144	
   145	2.  Upon notice published over the Service, CompuServe may modify
   146	these Terms, the Operating Rules, or the Service.  Such modifications
   147	may include, without limitation, price changes, implementation of user
   148	priorities and discontinuance of parts of the Service.  Upon at least
   149	six months' prior notice published over the Service, CompuServe may
   150	terminate the Service.
   151	
   152	3.  Customer's use of the Service is not transferable and is subject
   153	to any limits established for Customer's credit card or any limits
   154	established by CompuServe.
   155	
   156	4.  Customer is responsible for and must provide all telephone and
   157	other equipment necessary to access the Service.
   158	
   159	5.  The Service is provided on an "as-is, as-available" basis.
   160	NEITHER COMPUSERVE, ITS DISTRIBUTORS, NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE ANY
   161	WARRANTIES, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THOSE
   162	OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT
   163	TO THE SERVICE.  Customer is responsible for implementing sufficient
   164	procedures and chec kpoints to satisfy his/her requirements for
   165	accuracy of data input and output and for maintaining a means external
   166	to the Service for reconstruction of any lost data.
   167	
   168	6.  Customer will not reproduce, sell, publish, or in any manner
   169	commercially exploit any information obtained through the Service or
   170	participate in or allow such reproduction, sale, publications or
   171	exploitation by any person.
   172	
   173	7.  The provisions of paragraphs 5 and 6 are for the benefit of
   174	CompuServe and its data suppliers; any such data supplier shall have
   175	the right to assert and/or to enforce such provisions directly on its
   176	own behalf.
   177	
   178	8.  In addition to connect time charges, monthly minimums, and
   179	purchases made through the Service, Customer will be responsible for
   180	payment of all premium program charges, transaction charges, and/or
   181	add-on connect time charges when the Customer utilizes such services
   182	that generate these charges, and for any surcharges incurred while
   183	using any supplemental networks other than CompuServe.
   184	
   185	9.  This Agreement will be performed in and governed by the laws of
   186	the State of Ohio.  Any claims or causes of action related to the
   187	Service must be instituted within one year after the claim or cause of
   188	action has arisen or be barred. Service Agreement I agree to pay the
   189	CompuServe Information Service rates in effect for the billing period
   190	in which the services are purchased and billed. I agree to pay the
   191	validation charge in effect at the time this Agreement is accepted by
   192	CompuServe.  I agree to the terms and conditions of the Billin g
   193	Option which I have selected and as published over the Service.  I
   194	shall maintain confidentiality of my password at all times and take
   195	responsiblity for its security. I have read and fully understand the
   196	Terms of this Agreement and agree to be bound by them.
