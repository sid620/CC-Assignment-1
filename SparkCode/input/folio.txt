     1	February 11, 1992, Boston, Mass.--Folio MailBag, the first software that
     2	lets users store and perform full-text retrieval on infobases of
     3	electronic mail messages, will get its first large-scale public showing

    15	About Infobases
    16	
    17	An infobase is a repository (file) of electronic information that is
    18	analogous to a database. However, an infobase is much more effective at
    19	managing the free-format and semi-structured kinds of information that
    20	people deal with most often. Folio's line of software products, known as
    21	infobase management software, is designed to give users various
    22	capabilities to build and/or manage infobases and the information they
    23	contain.
