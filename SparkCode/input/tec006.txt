    17	  TITLE:
    18	      Loading STACKER into high memory.
    19	
    20	  OVERVIEW:
    21	      To conserve base memory, it is possible to load the STACKER driver into
    22	      high memory (between 640K and 1024K) on systems with 80286 chips and
    23	      higher.  Appropriate memory management software (QRAM, MOVE'EM, QEMM386,
    24	      386MAX) and hardware are needed.  Loading high on an 80286 machine
    25	      requires hardware support for Expanded Memory Specification (EMS) 4.0
    26	      (see User's Manual, "Loading STACKER into High Memory").
    27	
    28	      Note: For loading high using MS-DOS 5.0's DEVICEHIGH, see TECH015.DOC,
    29	      "Loading STACKER into upper memory with MS-DOS 5.0".
    30	
    31	  ISSUES/COMMENTS:
    32	      Potential problems with loading high are:
    33	      -crowding in high memory, resulting in disk-read errors;
    34	      -erratic behavior of memory-intensive programs;
    35	      -exclude-phrases omitted from the memory manager device line (STACKER
    36	          coprocessor version only);
    37	      -load-high driver not invoked in STACKER.COM device driver line;
    38	      -STACKER cache (/M=xx) specified at excessive size;
    39	      -insufficiently large block of contiguous memory between 640K and 1024K.
    40	
    41	  RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
    42	      1) Consult documentation for memory manager to verify syntax in
    43	      CONFIG.SYS.  (User's Manual, page 33, shows examples of modification to
    44	      STACKER line only.)
    45	
    46	      2) If applicable, edit load-high driver line to exclude range used by
    47	      coprocessor card (see User's Manual, "Re-enabling Memory Managers").
    48	      Note that the correct syntax for the AT&T 6300's AEMM.SYS is /X=addr-
    49	      addr.
    50	
    51	      3) Verify syntax of load-high statement in STACKER.COM device driver line
    52	      (see User's Manual, "Loading STACKER into High Memory").
    53	
    54	      4) Reduce size of STACKER disk cache (/M=xx switch in STACKER.COM device
    55	      driver line).
    56	
    57	      5) To verify load-high status, use a memory-mapping utility such as
    58	      Quarterdeck's MANIFEST.  If Interrupts 25 and 26 are at a segment value
    59	      above A000, then STACKER is loaded high.
