     4	This text file was prepared at the request of the ASP (Association of 
     5	Shareware Professionals), but the information contained in it may be of 
     6	value to any shareware author.

     9	FILE_ID.DIZ INFORMATION
    10	-----------------------
    11	Basically, the FILE_ID.DIZ file is a straight ASCII text file, distributed 
    12	inside your distribution archive file along with your program files, which 
    13	contains a description of your program. This file will be used by most BBS 
    14	(Bulletin Board System) softwares for the online file description of your 
    15	file. We recommend that the FILE_ID.DIZ file be used in all of your 
    16	distribution archives. 
    17	
    18	This text file contains a description of the FILE_ID.DIZ file, as well as a 
    19	description of the recommended distribution archive format.
    20	
    21	
    22	WHY SHOULD YOU USE FILE_ID.DIZ?
    23	-------------------------------
    24	The use of this file will insure that the online description of your 
    25	program will be in your own words (and who better to describe your program 
    26	than yourself?), and that it will remain the same no matter how many 
    27	different people upload your file to various BBS systems. 
    28	
    29	As more and more BBS software makes use of this file, you can be assured 
    30	that your own description will replace such online descriptions as "Cool 
    31	Program" or "OK utility, but needs better ..."
    32	
    33	Please note that the ASP Hub Network, the Author Direct FDN (File 
    34	Distribution Network), and the majority of other electronic distribution 
    35	services *REQUIRE* that a valid FILE_ID.DIZ file be contained in your 
    36	submitted distribution archive. If your file doesn't contain a valid 
    37	FILE_ID.DIZ file, then it simply won't be distributed by these services. 
    38	Furthermore, most BBS sysops will not accept uploads of files which do not 
    39	contain a valid FILE_ID.DIZ file, so you automatically lose out on that 
    40	distribution as well.
    41	
    42	
    43	DESCRIPTION:
    44	------------
    45	FILE_ID.DIZ was created by Clark Development for use with their PCBDescribe 
    46	utility, as a means for shareware authors to provide descriptions for their 
    47	products, and thus so that BBS callers can upload the file(s) without 
    48	having to manually type in a file description. 
    49	
    50	As long as an author creates and includes a FILE_ID.DIZ file in their 
    51	distribution fileset, the text from that file will be used for the online 
    52	description (in most cases) rather than anything typed in by the uploader. 
    53	It also ensures that the online description is always the same regardless 
    54	of the number of different BBS systems the file is posted on. It has since 
    55	been accepted by the BBS industry more-or-less as the "standard" file 
    56	description source. (The extension of "DIZ" actually stands for 
    57	"Description In Zip").
    58	
    59	NOTE: The FILE_ID.DIZ file *MUST* be named exactly that, and *NOT* 
    60	something like <filename>.DIZ. It will *ONLY* be used if it is named 
    61	FILE_ID.DIZ!
    62	
    63	The FILE_ID.DIZ file is nothing more than a straight ASCII text file which 
    64	contains the full description of the archived file containing it. It is 
    65	used by most popular BBS software to describe your program, rather than 
    66	using the description supplied by the person that uploaded your file. It 
    67	should be placed *INSIDE* your distribution archive file. The FILE_ID.DIZ 
    68	file is defined by its creators (Clark Development) as being created by the 
    69	program author, and *NOT* the end user who is trying to upload the program.
    70	
    71	The BBS software will "look" inside the archive file. If a FILE_ID.DIZ file 
    72	is found, it will replace any existing online file description with the 
    73	text contained in FILE_ID.DIZ. It is an excellent method for making sure 
    74	that your program files are described the way that "you" want them 
    75	described. Even sysops who's software can't automatically make use of the 
    76	FILE_ID.DIZ file have found it to be an excellent source for their manually 
    77	added file descriptions.
    78	
    79	
    80	STRUCTURE:
    81	----------
    82	The file consists of straight ASCII text, up to 10 lines of text, each line 
    83	being no more than 45 characters long. It should *NOT* contain any blank 
    84	lines, any form of centering or formatting, or any Hi-ASCII or ANSI 
    85	characters. (i.e. it should ONLY contain alpha & numeric characters).
    86	
    87	We recommended that it consist of 5 basic parts:
    88	
    89	   1. the proper name of your program
    90	   2. the version number
    91	   3. the "ASP" identifier (optional, for ASP members)
    92	   4. the description separator
    93	   4. the description
    94	
    95	All of the above parts should be separated by a single "space".
    96	
    97	PROGRAM NAME: To set it apart from the rest, it is recommended that you use 
    98	ALL CAPS for the program name.
    99	
   100	VERSION NUMBER: The version number should be in the form of "v12.34". 
   101	
   102	ASP IDENTIFIER: If you are an ASP author, we recommend that an "<ASP>" 
   103	identifying mark be added after the version number, to identify your 
   104	product as an ASP-authored product.
   105	
   106	DESCRIPTION SEPARATOR: To separate the actual description text, insert a 
   107	simple "-" (dash/minus) character after the ASP identifier (or version 
   108	number, if not using the ASP identifier), and in front of the description 
   109	text.
   110	
   111	DESCRIPTION: You should attempt to FULLY describe your product, including 
   112	its most important functions and features. Be sure to include anything 
   113	which will separate your program from it's competition, and make the BBS 
   114	user want to download your file. Also try to include any hardware or 
   115	software requirements that your product may have.
   116	
   117	You should try to use the first 2 lines of the text to give a basic 
   118	description of your program. This is helpful for sysops who's BBS software 
   119	limits them to less than 10 lines, 45 characters. Sysops who are limited to 
   120	using shorter descriptions can simply use the 1st two lines and truncate 
   121	the rest. Thus, you can basically still supply your own description for BBS 
   122	software which does not actually utilize the FILE_ID.DIZ feature.
   123	
   124	The remaining lines of text can be used to elaborate on the programs 
   125	features, enhancements from the prior version, information concerning 
   126	multi-file sets. Please note that older versions of some BBS software can 
   127	only use 8 lines of text. It is advisable that you create your FILE_ID.DIZ 
   128	file so that the file can be truncated to various line lengths without 
   129	destroying it's usefulness.
   130	
   131	
   132	EXAMPLE
   133	-------
   134	MY PROGRAM v1.23 <ASP> - A program which will
   135	do anything for anybody. Will run in only 2k
   136	of memory. Can be run from the command line,
   137	or installed as a TSR. Completely menu-
   138	driven. Version 1.23 reduces the previous 4k
   139	memory requirements, and adds an enhanced
   140	graphical user interface. Also, MY PROGRAM 
   141	now contains Windows and DESQview support. 
   142	Coming soon - an OS/2 version.

   144	
   145	
   146	MULTIPLE DISK INFO
   147	------------------
   148	Please note that if your distribution archive requires multiple archive 
   149	files, you should create a separate, specific FILE_ID.DIZ file for each 
   150	archive. This can be utilized to describe the various contents of each 
   151	archive, and to identify each disk in the set. For example, the FILE_ID.DIZ 
   152	file for disk #1 could contain:
   153	
   154	   "MY PROGRAM v1.23 <ASP> Program Executable 
   155	    Files - Disk 1 of 2"
   156	    [followed by detailed description text]
   157	
   158	while the FILE_ID.DIZ file for disk #2 could contain:
   159	
   160	   "MY PROGRAM v1.23 <ASP> Documentation Files - 
   161	    Disk 2 of 2"
   162	    [followed by more detailed description text]
   163	
   164	Optionally, you could also create a "complete" FILE_ID.DIZ file for the 
   165	first disk, which would fully describe the program in detail, and identify 
   166	it as Disk 1 of x. Then, for each remaining file in the set, simply include 
   167	the Program Name, version number, ASP identifier, and the disk number (i.e. 
   168	"MY PROGRAM v1.23 <ASP> Disk 2 of x").
   169	
   170	
   171	ADDITIONAL INFO
   172	---------------
   173	Please don't be tempted to use fancy graphic or ANSI sequences in the 
   174	FILE_ID.DIZ file, as most BBS software will not allow this, and will render 
   175	your FILE_ID.DIZ file useless. Also, don't be tempted to simply copy your 
   176	program description file to FILE_ID.DIZ. Attempting to "format" your 
   177	FILE_ID.DIZ file (i.e line centering, right & left justification, etc) will 
   178	also cause unexpected results, especially for BBS software which re-formats 
   179	descriptions to other than 10line/45char.
   180	
   181	Fred Hill <ASP> has written a freeware utility which interactively creates 
   182	a valid FILE_ID.DIZ file. The file is called DIZGEN.ZIP, and is included 
   183	with this distribution archive.  I highly recommend that you use this 
   184	utility for creating your FILE_ID.DIZ files.

   187	
   188	The following is a recommendation for the structure and contents of 
   189	distribution archives prepared for use on BBS systems.
   190	
   191	
   192	DISTRIBUTION DISK RECOMMENDATIONS
   193	---------------------------------
   194	The following are recommendations for preparing your program files for 
   195	distribution to Bulletin Board Systems (BBSs) via the ASP's distribution 
   196	services, as well as other methods.
   197	
   198	Two varieties of program files are defined here:
   199	
   200	1) Program files which utilize an "install" utility and self-extracting 
   201	program archives (later referred to as "Author-Installed Programs").
   202	
   203	2) Programs files which do not use install utilities or self-extracting 
   204	archives (later referred to as "User-Installed Programs").
   205	
   206	
   207	AUTHOR-INSTALLED PROGRAMS:
   208	--------------------------
   209	These programs require a bit more work from the author, but will eliminate 
   210	many user mistakes, especially in programs which require complicated 
   211	setups.
   212	
   213	Most "installation" utility programs will make use of program files which 
   214	have been "archived" into Self-Extracting (SFX) archives. We will attempt 
   215	to define which files should be contained in the Self-Extracting archives, 
   216	and which files should not.
   217	
   218	1. Files which should be contained in the self-extracting program file
   219	archive:
   220	
   221	        a. All program-specific executable files.
   222	        b. Any required configuration and/or data files required by the
   223	           program.
   224	        c. Program documentation files. Optionally, these may be left
   225	           outside of the self-extracting archive, in order to allow
   226	           them to be viewed/read by the various archive viewing utlities.
   227	        d. Any other program-specific files that are required for the
   228	           operation of the program.
   229	
   230	2. The files described above should be compiled into a self-extracting 
   231	archive file, which will then be extracted by the install utility.
   232	
   233	NOTE: the author is required to abide by any distribution requirements 
   234	specified by the archive utility author, and to obtain any required 
   235	distribution rights necessary. Please check to see if distribution rights 
   236	are required for your archive utility choice.
   237	
   238	3. Files which should NOT be contained in the self-extracting program file 
   239	archive:
   240	
   241	        a. The install utility itself (obviously).
   242	        b. The FILE_ID.DIZ file. (described in detail in the section
   243	           preceding this one)
   244	        c. Any distribution/information files, such as VENDOR.TXT,
   245	           SYSOP.TXT, etc.
   246	        d. Any description or information file, such as DESCRIBE.TXT.
   247	        e. A user file (such as README.1ST), which should explain how
   248	           to use the install utility, what the user should expect
   249	           during the installation, and any preparation that the user
   250	           should make prior to the installation. This file might also
   251	           contain a brief description of your program, in case the user
   252	           is able to read the documentation files in the distribution
   253	           archive prior to downloading (many BBS systems offer this
   254	           ability to the user).
   255	
   256	4. The actual distribution archive file (described below) should then 
   257	contain the install utility, the self-extracting program archive, and the 
   258	files described in #3 above.
   259	
   260	
   261	USER-INSTALLED PROGRAMS:
   262	------------------------
   263	This type of distribution archive is much simpler than the Author-Installed 
   264	variety. It should simply be an archive file, containing all of the files 
   265	for the program described above.
   266	
   267	Since this type of program requires the user to do all of the installation 
   268	manually, it should contain very specific and detailed information 
   269	regarding the installation requirements (such as INSTALL.TXT).
   270	
   271	
   272	THE DISTRIBUTION ARCHIVE FILE:
   273	------------------------------
   274	The actual distribution archive file should merely be an archive file 
   275	containing the files described above. For BBS distribution, this archive 
   276	should be of the standard archive format, and -NOT- a self-extracting 
   277	archive.  Many sysops will not allow self-extracting archives, and most BBS 
   278	software will not allow self-extracting archives to be uploaded.
   279	
   280	There are many popular archive utilities available, such as PKZIP, LHA, 
   281	LHARC, ARJ, etc. Most BBS systems are capable of handling archives in 
   282	virtually any format. However, you should be aware that most BBS systems 
   283	will convert your archive format to the format of choice by the sysop. By 
   284	following the methods described above, this conversion process should not 
   285	affect your program, or any self-extracting files which are contained 
   286	within your distribution archive file.
   287	
   288	You should also retain the default archive file extension defined by the 
   289	archive utility. For example, PKZIP uses a ".ZIP", LHARC uses "LZH", etc. 
   290	Changing the file extension may cause the BBS software to delete your file 
   291	because it doesn't recognize the format.
   292	
   293	For the actual filename for your distribution archive, it is recommended 
   294	that the program filename be limited to 6 characters to represent the 
   295	program's name (i.e. MYPROG could represent "My Program"). This should be 
   296	followed by 2 numeric digits which will represent the version number of 
   297	your release. Even if this is your initial release it should include the 
   298	version number in the filename (i.e. MYPROG10.ZIP would indicate the 
   299	program called "My Program" version 1.0).
   300	
   301	Please note that CompuServe limits filenames to only 6 characters. By 
   302	limiting the file "name" to 6 characters, you will easily be able to rename 
   303	the archive for CompuServe uploading by simply removing the 2-digit version 
   304	identifier, to make the file compatible with CompuServe libraries.
   305	
   306	By including the 2-digit version number in the archive filename, it will be 
   307	very easy for both the user and the sysop (and yourself) to identify older 
   308	versions of your program.
   309	
   310	
   311	MULTIPLE DISTRIBUTION ARCHIVES
   312	------------------------------
   313	At one time, it was recommended that your final distribution archive not be 
   314	larger than 350k, so that it would fit on a single 360k floppy disk and 
   315	still leave room for any distribution files necessary for Disk Vendors. 
   316	(i.e. Disk Vendors will often include their own GO.BAT file, or other 
   317	various small files to help their customers install the software). This 
   318	limitation is slowly falling by the wayside as more and more computer 
   319	systems have 3.5" floppy disk drives as standard.
   320	
   321	If your program is large enough to require more than one distribution 
   322	archive, it is recommended that your filename be limited to 5 characters 
   323	rather than 6 as described above. Following the 5-character name should be 
   324	the same 2-digit version number. Then, append a single "letter" to identify 
   325	the disk (i.e. MYPGM10A.ZIP, MYPGM10B.ZIP, etc.). For uploading to 
   326	CompuServe, these filenames may then be shortened to 6 characters by 
   327	removing the version identifiers (i.e. MYPGMA.ZIP, MYPGMB.ZIP). However, 
   328	for CompuServe it is recommended that you simply create a single 
   329	distibution file, and eliminate the multi-part file set.
   330	
   331	If your program requires multiple distribution archives, -BE SURE- to 
   332	create separate FILE_ID.DIZ files for each distribution archive. Also, each 
   333	FILE_ID.DIZ file should contain disk number information pertaining to each 
   334	individual archive (i.e. Disk 1 of 3, Disk 2 of 3, etc.).
   335	
   336	
   337	THE DISTRIBUTION DISK
   338	---------------------
   339	It is recommended that your distribution disk simply contain a ZIPd version 
   340	of your product. However, If you choose to supply "unarchived" files on a 
   341	distribution disk for Disk Vendor use, it is _VERY_ important that you 
   342	specify in your documentation a suggested archive filename, so that BBS 
   343	sysops can create archived files with the proper author-specified 
   344	filenames. This information should be contained in your SYSOP.TXT (or 
   345	VENDOR.TXT) file. If you don't supply a suggested archive file name, the 
   346	sysops will be forced to create the name themselves, thus you may end up 
   347	with thousands of versions of your products on BBS systems all over the 
   348	world, but all with different filenames.
   349	
   350	Please note that the ASP Hub Network, and nearly every other electronic 
   351	distribution service *REQUIRE* that your files be submitted as an archived 
   352	file, using the ZIP format. Also note that many BBS sysops will not go to 
   353	the trouble of ZIPing your unarchived files for you. If you don't supply 
   354	them with an archived distribution version of your product, it might not 
   355	get distributed by BBSs.
   356	
   357	If you supply your own disk labels, it is recommended that the ASP logo, or 
   358	at least the initials "ASP" be included on the label, so that anyone can 
   359	immediately identify your disk as an ASP member's software.
   360	
   361	
   362	SUMMARY
   363	-------
   364	Your distribution disk should now be ready to submit to the various BBSs, 
   365	distribution services, and Disk Vendors.
   366	
   367	You may choose to create a separate distribution disk for use by BBSs and 
   368	Disk Vendors. However, if you follow the above steps in preparing your 
   369	distribution archive file, a separate "Disk Vendor" disk is probably not 
   370	necessary. The majority of disk vendors will be able to accept your 
   371	distribution file/disk if it is prepared in the above described format.
