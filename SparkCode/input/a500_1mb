     1	This is the CORRECT way to make your A501 chip ram!!
     2	
     3	There have been other docs floating around saying to toggle the JP7A jumper,
     4	but this is not true! Clear it instead! For all of you who have tried the
     5	A501 chip ram fix and got nothing but a system crash on bootup, this is the
     6	doc 4 u :-)

     8	Thanks to Greg Change (gchance@ecst.csuchico.edu) for information on how to
     9	correctly do this :-)

    19	
    20	Now I've got myself covered, lets' go on.
    21	
    22	First off, it is required you have a revision 6A motherboard for this pro-
    23	ject. It will work with others, but requires a 1mb Agnus chip and also re-
    24	quires cutting a trace, which I am not familiar with at the moment.
    25	
    26	If you are unfamiliar with electronic repair and modifications, ask an ex-
    27	perienced technician to proceed with the modification.
    28	
    29	READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY AND THOROUGHLY BEFORE INITATING PROCEDURE!!
    30	    
    31	Tools needed:
    32	
    33	  #10 Torx Screwdriver
    34	  Flat Head Screwdriver
    35	  Low Power Soldering Iron
    36	  Razor Blade or Exacto-Knife  
    37	  Anti-Static Guard (optional)
    38	     
    39	1. Turn off computer and unplug ALL cords and peripherals from the computer.
    40	   This includes the A501.
    41	
    42	2. Now carefully flip the computer over. WARNING! Do NOT grab the A500 on
    43	   the left side if the expansion dust cover is off! If you tug hard enough,
    44	   you will snap off the connector, and the only way to replace that is by
    45	   buying a new motherboard! It's just an edge-connector and can snap easily.
    46	      
    47	3. Plug in the soldering iron, just to get it all nice and warm. (make sure
    48	   the iron has been on for at LEAST 15 minutes to avoid cold solder joints.
    49	   
    50	4. Now take the #10 Torx screwdriver and remove the 6 Torx screws around the
    51	   edge of the case (at this point the bottom is facing up, of course. Do
    52	   NOT remove any other screws on the bottom of your computer. Save the po-
    53	   sition of each screw, because some may be intentionally different lengths
    54	   
    55	5. Flip the computer over again and carefully remove the top. If it doesn't
    56	   remove with ease, use the flat head screwdriver to pry open the sides.
    57	   Using a large screwdriver will make less pry marks in the case, or put a
    58	   cloth around it or something. :-) Hopefully this won't permanently de-
    59	   stroy the latches in the sides. They should just snap right back togethor
    60	   
    61	6. Now remove the cable going from the keyboard to the socket on the mother-
    62	   board. It should just pull right out.
    63	   
    64	7. Now take the keyboard out and set it off to the side for now.
    65	
    66	8. Now remove the two Torx screws on the left side of the computer facing
    67	   the front. Remove the other two Torx screws holding down the grounding
    68	   plate of the external expansion port. Now carefully remove these screws
    69	   and the grounding plate. Remember the positions of each screw! Try not
    70	   to mix them up! Also- Make note of the text under the disk drive. It
    71	   should tell you the model, "B52/ROCK LOBSTER" (if you're lucky) and some
    72	   other junk. Now look for the text "Rev. 6A". If your motherboard is not
    73	   6A, like I mentioned before, you can still do the mod, but you need to
    74	   cut a special trace and unfortunately, I cannot help you with this.
    75	   
    76	9. Now is the time to don your anti-static wrist strap, or whatever have
    77	   you.
    78	   
    79	10. Look around the edge of the RF shield for small metal tabs holding the
    80	    cover down. Now carefully bend these tabs up with the flat head screw-
    81	    driver. Becareful not to bend them too much, or they will snap off.
    82	    This is what happened to mine. :-)
    83	    
    84	11. Now remove the RF shield cover.
    85	
    86	12. Get ready, here is the time to do the modification. Be careful not to 
    87	    hit the Amiga's plastic case with the soldering iron. I did this on some
    88	    practice soldering equipment (broken VCR's etc) a while ago and once you
    89	    destroy the case you're Amiga will no longer look pretty. (thank god I
    90	    didn't do THIS :-)

    95	Ami |            Fig 1
    96	   ++   ____
    97	E  :: -|    |-                   
    98	X  :: -|    |-                  
    99	P  :: -| M  |- 1|       13. Now locate Jumper 2 (JP2) Between the CPU  
   100	A  :: -| C  |-  | JP2       and the ROM chip (just above and left of
   101	N  :: -| 6  |- 2|   _       the ROM chip.) The jumper consists of three 
   102	S  :: -| 8  |-    =| |=     solder "pads". See how Fig 1 has these pads
   103	I P:: -| 0  |- 3| =|R|=     numbered. When your computer arrived, pads
   104	O O:: -| 0  |-    =|O|=     2 and 3 should have been set. We are about
   105	N R:: -| 0  |-    =|M|=     to change this. Now take your razor blade
   106	  T:: -|    |-    =| |=     or Xacto knife and just the trace between
   107	   :: -|____|-    =|_|=     pad 2 and 3. Make sure, and check with a multi-
   108	   ++                       meter or magnifying glass that there is no 
   109	                            connection between these two pads. Now take
   110	                            your HOT soldering iron and solder, and 
   111	                            connect pads 2 and 1, just like the jumper
   112	               =            depicted in Fig 1. Make sure it is a solid
   113	               = Fig 2      connection and not a cold joint.
   114	               =
   115	               =
   116	               =        14. Now it is time to locate the other jumper,
   117	        JP7A   =            which is just left of the connector to the
   118	               =            trapdoor (where the A501 goes). Search for
   119	          1|   = Trapdoor   another three-padded jumper, labeled "JP7A"
   120	               =            or JP7. Now cut the trace which was connecting
   121	          2|   =            pads 2 and 3. Make sure it is a clean, solid 
   122	               =            cut. This jumper should be left open, and no
   123	          3|   =            pad should be soldered to another.
   124	               =
   125	               =
   126	               =
   127	               
   128	15. Now check and make sure all connections are firm and clean, and replace
   129	    the RF cover. Then push down the metal tabs and make sure the cover is
   130	    secure at those points.
   131	    
   132	16. Now replace the grounding plate and CAREFULLY screw the two Torx screws
   133	    in. These are special screws- so as soon as it feels firm, no NOT turn
   134	    ANY further! This can strip the screwholes and damage your case perm-
   135	    enantly. Remember to put each screw in it's dedicated position.
   136	    
   137	17. Now replace the other two Torx screws and once again screw them in just
   138	    until secure. Remember once again to put each screw in it's dedicated
   139	    position.
   140	    
   141	18. Replace the keyboard and set it in the special slots so it is secure.
   142	    Carefully replace the keyboard cord, and make SURE it is inserted the
   143	    correct way. If it is not then I cannot guarantee your system will boot
   144	    up and work correctly.
   145	    
   146	19. Now snap the top case of the A500 back on. Make sure it is perfectly
   147	    aligned and all.
   148	    
   149	20. Now carefully flip over the A500, and remember not to grab the edge-
   150	    connector! I have never seen this incedent happen but I'm sure it has.
   151	    Such a simple mistake could cost you a whole new computer/motherboard.
   152	    
   153	21. Now insert each Torx screw. And once again remember to put each screw
   154	    in it's dedicated position. (whew!)
   155	    
   156	22. Now return the A501 to the trapdoor, close it up and flip the Amiga 
   157	    over. (and now I KNOW you know not to grab the edge-connector :-)
   158	    
   159	23. Plug all other peripherals and cords back in, and turn the machine on.
   160	
   161	24. If it boots up O.K, then hopefully you're in buisness. Now run a program
   162	    like SysInfo or PerfMon to make sure you have 1024k of chip ram (1mb)
   163	    
   164	25. Have fun! It is now possible to load large large mods, have more graphic
   165	    data in memory at once, play better demos, and, in short, fit along with
   166	    the rest of the world! :-) Good luck!
   167	    
   168	*** If you are having any problems I encourage you to check all of these 
   169	    steps and make sure nothing was left out or improperly done.
   170	    
   171	    Stay Cool with your new 1mb of Chip Ram,
