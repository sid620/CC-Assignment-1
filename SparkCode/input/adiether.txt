     1	San Jose, Calif.--February 11, 1992 - The AQUILA Network Products Division
     2	(ANPD) of ADI Systems, Inc. has recently expanded its AQUILA networking
     3	line by marketing two new products. The first product is a three-quarter
     4	sized controller card for EISA systems that features a 32-bit bus
     5	architecture designed with National's ST-NIC Ethernet controller chip,
     6	allowing support of 10BaseT as well as thick or thin Ethernet--au on the
     7	same card for enhanced user convenience.
     8	
     9	This 3-in-1 EISA Controller, Model AQ-EISA, is equipped with dual-port 32Kb
    10	buffer memory and utilizes shared-memory architecture, providing users
    11	with higher throughput than designs which depend on DMA or I/O mapped
    12	architecture. Among other features are CSMA/CD media access control,
    13	baseband signalling, and a 10Mbps data transfer rate. Software support
    14	includes ODI and IPX drivers for servers and workstations that support
    15	Novell NetWare 2.x and 3.x versions, as well as a TCP/IP driver for
    16	supporting Interactive Systems Corp. (ISC) Unix 2.2 and Santa Cruz
    17	Operation (SCO) Open Desktop 3.2.1. In addition, a diagnostics program is
    18	included which runs a loop-back test, tests the dual-ported RAM, checks
    19	the controller I/O base address, tests the interrupt request, and displays
    20	the Ethernet address.
    21	
    22	This controller is designed to boost the performance of EISA-based 386/486
    23	servers. Performance evaluations running Novell's Perform3 benchmark test,
    24	compared to other EISA adapters available on the market, confirm that this
    25	controller is one of the fastest of all cards tested while requiring the
    26	least server CPU resources of non-bus mastering adapters. The AQUILA
    27	Controller complies with all IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standards, comes with a
    28	full five-year warranty, and has a U.S. list price of $499.
    29	
    30	The second NPD item marketed under the AQUILA name is a Pocket LAN Adapter,
    31	targeted for laptops and notebooks, of which there are three different
    32	models: two Ethernet Adapters (Models AQ-ECX-PKT and AQ-ETP-PKT) and one
    33	ARCnet Adapter (Model AQ-ARC-PKT). Each of these models utilizes a
    34	standard 25-pin parallel port and has no configuration switches. While the
    35	AQ-ECX-PKT supports a 10Base2 thin coaxial topology, the AQ-ETP-PKT is
    36	used for 10BaseT. The AQ-ARC-PKT, on the other hand, supports an ARCnet
    37	star or bus topology. Novell NetWare 286/386 drivers and a NetBIOS driver
    38	are offered with all three models, but the two Ethernet Adapters also
    39	support FTP PCITCP, PC-NFS, and 3Com 3+Share.
    40	
    41	By avoiding the need for an internal I/O bus slot, each of these Adapter
    42	versions eliminates the need for jumper and switch settings and hardware
    43	interrupt and address conflicts typical with more conventional card-type
    44	adapters. With the use of an external parallel port, these Adapters assure
    45	automatic configuration with IBM 286, 386, 486, PS/2, and compatibles.
    46	They are especially ideal for laptops, notebooks, and small footprint
    47	desktops because
    48	
    49	ù They do not require an I/O slot, making it possible for computers without
    50	available slots to attach to a network.
    51	
    52	ù They preserve the computer's battery power
    53	
    54	ù The housing is compact (4.57"L x 2.52"W x .85"H) and lightweight (8 oz.)
    55	
    56	ù The 110V and 220V power input support provides added convenience for the
    57	international traveler
    58	
    59	The Ethernet Coax and 10BaseT versions of this Adapter list in the U.S. for
    60	$299 while the ARCnet version is listed at $209. Each carries a one-year
    61	warranty.

   232	
   233	--------------------------------------------------------
   234	
   235	San Jose, Calif.--February 11, 1992 - The AQUILA Network Products Division
   236	(ANPD) of ADI Systems, Inc., has just announced the release of its
   237	AQ-IHUB-12TP, an intelligent 13-port, 10BaseT hub. This unique intelligent
   238	hub can connect up to 12 workstations on an Ethernet LAN using
   239	
   240	10BaseT twisted pair cabling and either one workstation or a file server
   241	using 10Base2 coaxial cabling.
   242	
   243	Triple Function Capability
   244	
   245	The AQ-IHUB-12TP can function either as a managed, intelligent hub or as a
   246	dumb ("unmanaged") hub targeted toward small-to-medium size businesses.
   247	When it is used together with LanExec, an SNMP-based network management
   248	system from ADI Systems, Inc., the AQ-IHUB-12TP operates intelligently.
   249	Otherwise, in its standard configuration, it serves as an unmanaged hub.
   250	
   251	A third way that the AQ-IHUB-12TP may function is as an intelligent hub
   252	compatible with Novell's HMI standard.
   253	
   254	"This gives users three options," says Raymond Hou, ADI's Executive VP.
   255	"They can purchase it hub that not only has upgrade flexibility and a
   256	unique 13-port, single-slot design. Or they may feel that they want to put
   257	it into a server and utilize the HMI support the AQIHUB-12TP offers."
   258	
   259	AQ-IHUB-12TP: A New Low-Price Leader
   260	
   261	The hub controller, cable, and optional hub console with external RJ45
   262	connections lists for $999, or just under $77 per port. This makes the
   263	AQIHUB-12TP the lowest-price-per-port for any SNMP-based intelligent hub
   264	as other 10BaseT hubs which offer advanced network capabilities typically
   265	cost more than $140 per port. In addition, the price-per-port of the
   266	AQ-IHUB-12TP, is almost one-half that of the previous low-price leader,
   267	David Systems' Express Net Concentrator.
   268	
   269	Key Features of the New AQUILA Intelligent Hub
   270	
   271	The AQ-IHUB-12TP has several key features to offer the user:
   272	
   273	ù Capability of being an intelligent, managed 10BaseT hub when used with
   274	ADI's LanExec SNMP-based management software
   275	
   276	ù Capability of being used as a standard, unmanaged 10BaseT hub with no
   277	additional expense required to convert for use in network management under
   278	the LanExec SNMP management software program
   279	
   280	ù Capability to serve as an intelligent 10BaseT hub that can be managed by
   281	Novell's HMI specification
   282	
   283	ù An 8-bit, ISA-bus card, designed with the National Semiconductor Repeater
   284	Interface Controller (RIC). This card contains a 50-pin connector, a
   285	female BNC connector, and two LEDs
   286	
   287	ù Red collision-status LEDs (to indicate collisions) and green
   288	data-transmission LEDs (to indicate transmissions) on the bracket of the
   289	hub controller.
   290	
   291	ù Green LEDs on the front of the hub console to display link integrity
   292	
   293	ù 13 network connections, supporting up to 13 ports and consisting of
   294	twelve 10BaseT RJ45 connectors and one thin Ethernet Coax BNC connection
   295	
   296	ù Twelve-lOBaseT-port availability per slot and mounting bracket of a PC,
   297	compared to the more conventional availability of occupying three slot
   298	spaces and mounting brackets to obtain twelve 10BaseT ports where 4-port
   299	hub cards are utilized. (Thus, the AQUILA hub controller requires only
   300	one-third of the slot space of conventional hub cards.)
   301	
   302	ù A six-foot cable that allows for attachment to the optional
   303	AQ-IHUB-CONSOLE, to an optional harmonica with patch panel for rack
   304	mounting, or to a punch block connector for the phone closet
   305	
   306	ù Up to four AQIHUB-12TP controllers can be installed in a single PC
   307	
   308	ù A BNC T-connector for connecting the hub controller to a 10Base2 Ethernet
   309	segment
   310	
   311	ù An optional external console (AQ-IHUB-CONSOLE) which has a compact
   312	(1.5-in. high x 4.75-in wide x 7.25-in. long) size and includes 12 RJ45
   313	jacks, 12 LEDs, and a 50-pin connector
   314	
   315	Installation Options With the AQ IHUB-12TP
   316	
   317	The hub controller may be installed in any IBM PC or PC AT system or
   318	compatible, which would be designated as the hub station. Hub stations are
   319	nondedicated systems; that is, they retain full capabilities as
   320	stand-alone systems.
   321	
   322	Up to four AQ-IHUB-12TP hub controllers and a NIC can be installed in a hub
   323	station. Linking the NIC and the hub controller(s) permits the hub station
   324	to also function as a network workstation or file server. If the NIC is
   325	supported by LanExec and LanExec is installed on the network, the
   326	AQIHUB-12TP can function as an intelligent hub. One NIC is required for
   327	each hub controller for management.
   328	
   329	For the external 10BaseT port connections, the new AQUILA hub provides
   330	several installation options to fit particular wiring needs. The hub
   331	controller can be connected in one of three different ways:
   332	
   333	ù to the AQUILA Hub Console (AQ-IHUB-CONSOLE) by using the cable that comes
   334	with the
   335	
   336	hub controller, for a compact desktop unit with LEDs
   337	
   338	ù to a harmonica connector. with a patch panel for rack mounting
   339	[Recommended: a MOD-TAP 10BaseT 12-port harmonica connector & a MOD-TAP
   340	10BaseT, 2 x 12 port patch panel.]
   341	
   342	ù to a punch block for the wiring closet. using the 50-pin cable that comes
   343	with the AQ-IHUB-12TP. The punch block can handle twisted-pair wiring for
   344	12 workstations.
   345	
   346	A Versatile Hub That Can Function Three Ways
   347	
   348	AQIHUB-12TP becomes an intelligent hub by working with ADI's LanExec
   349	software, a SNMP-based network management program for small to medium
   350	sized 10BaseT and Coax Ethernet LANs. The hub controller needs to be
   351	connected in the same PC with any of the following Ethernet NICs-- NE1000,
   352	NE2000, 3COM 3C503, AQUILA, or any ADI-certified compatibles. This allows
   353	the NIC to load a LanExec SNMP Agent that works together with the hub
   354	controller to provide key data to LanExec's SNMP Manager, such as:
   355	
   356	ù Packet count for SNMP, IPX, and NetBIOS
   357	
   358	ù MIB II information, including System Group and SNMP Group information
   359	
   360	ù Private MIB II extension information, including the following-- System:
   361	machine type, workstation CPU, DOS version & BIOS date Software: software
   362	driver & agent version, agent status, and protocol stack Configuration:
   363	specifying type information, node name, node & slot ID, and IP address
   364	Port Statistics: including packet transmit/receive counts Partition: to
   365	enable/disable hub ports Hub Reset: for resetting the hub controller Hub
   366	Card Reset: for resetting the NIC which provides intelligent management of
   367	the hub
   368	
   369	A second way that the AQ-IHUB-12TP can be used is as a hub which is
   370	compatible with Novell's HMI standard, allowing workstations to use a LAN
   371	server as an intelligent network hub. This alternative management
   372	capability will be available during the second quarter of 1992. Customers
   373	who purchase the AQ-IHUB-12TP now will receive the HMI driver from ADI at
   374	no additional cost.
   375	
   376	A final way the AQ-IHUB-12TP may be used is as an unmanaged hub, but with
   377	the capability of becoming managed at a later time. Those who choose to
   378	use AQ-IHUB-12TP as an unmanaged hub will receive Novell management
   379	capabilities with it at no extra charge.
   380	
   381	Different network configurations are possible with the AQ-IHUB-12TP. The
   382	following illustrate some of the connections that can be made to suit a
   383	variety of needs:
   384	
   385	ù Four AQ-IHUB-12TP hub controllers can be in one hub station, with the BNC
   386	port on each hub controller connecting to a separate lOBase2 segment. This
   387	permits one hub station to support four AQ-IHUB LANs, each with up to 12
   388	workstations and one file server
   389	
   390	ù Same as above, but with all four controllers linked with lOBase2 cables.
   391	This configuration allows one hub station to support one AQIHUB LAN of up
   392	to 48 workstations and one file server.
   393	
   394	ù Same as above, but with the hub station containing one network interface
   395	card (NIC) and up to four hub controllers. This permits the hub station to
   396	function as a network workstation or the network file server.
   397	
   398	ù Two hub stations, each holding a hub controller and a NIC (making these
   399	hubs intelligent) can be connected with two other controllers without NICs
   400	(making these hubs unmanaged). This allows any PC in the group containing
   401	a NIC to be the file server for the entire group.
   402	
   403	Setting A New Price/Performance Standard
   404	
   405	The total price of $999 includes $899 for the hub controller and cable and
   406	$100 for the optional hub console, which provides 12 RJ-45 connectors.
   407	
   408	"This hub combines the best features of entry-level fixed hubs and high-end
   409	concentrators," claims Hou. "With conventional hubs, if you want to add
   410	LAN management capabilities, you have to discard your old hub. Not so with
   411	the AQ-IHUB-12TP. It's our intention to continue offering our customers
   412	greater networking intelligence and performance at very aggressive prices.
   413	We've been stressing the need to provide the small-to-medium LAN
   414	installations with the same management capabilities that the larger
   415	networks have. And we've done it by providing a 12-user LAN an intelligent
   416	hub with a SNMP management software package for under $1,500. For example,
   417	LanExec for 20-user capability is only $499. In effect, we've opened up a
   418	whole new segment of users to network management that had previously been
   419	neglected."
   420	
   421	This new intelligent hub from ADI Systems is the latest product from the
   422	AQUILA Network Products Division of ADI Systems, Inc.--established about
   423	two years ago to service the growing needs of LAN users. ANPD expanded its
   424	network connectivity line by selectively merging certain products from
   425	Aquila Communications to complete its own 10BaseT offerings. This division
   426	now carries a complete line of Ethernet and ARCnet controllers and hubs,
   427	and is introducing several new product introductions this year. It will be
   428	emphasizing intelligent SNMP-based network management of 10BaseT and coax
   429	Ethernet solutions optimized for use with Novell NetWare and NetBIOS-based
   430	operating systems.
