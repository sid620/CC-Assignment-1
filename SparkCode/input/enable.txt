     1	BOSTON, February 11, 1992--Enable Software today introduced Enable Office,
     2	a new version of its integrated software. Enable Office is a four-user
     3	suite that includes Higgins electronic mail, calendaring, and scheduling
     4	and Enable word processing, spreadsheet, relational database, business
     5	graphics, communications, and customization tools. Together the
     6	applications in Enable Office provide an integrated office system for
     7	networked personal computers.
     8	
     9	"Enable Office addresses the cost, productivity, and support concerns of
    10	companies using DOS-based personal computers," said Tom Sinopoli, vice
    11	president of marketing. "Enable Office provides the core office
    12	applications, including our award-winning Higgins E-mail, at a lower cost
    13	than individual packages." The company calculates that purchased
    14	separately, comparable application programs for four users would cost at
    15	least $3000, compared to the $995 price of Enable Office.
    16	
    17	Enable Office addresses productivity concerns with a common interface
    18	across applications that makes it simple and easy for users to become
    19	productive, according to Sinopoli. "You reduce the training, and get
    20	people working faster," he said.
    21	
    22	Acquiring a suite of applications from one company reduces the support
    23	overhead by providing a single point of contact. Having several
    24	applications in a single product also simplifies the task of managing user
    25	licenses.
    26	
    27	The Enable Software strategy is to increase the links between its
    28	integrated software and its electronic mail, calendaring, and scheduling
    29	products, according to Donald Payne, president and CEO. "The growth of
    30	networking puts new demands on users to work together. They must be able
    31	to share information with one another and move it easily between software
    32	applications," Payne said.
    33	
    34	Integrated Application Suite
    35	
    36	Enable integrated software is distinguished by the strength of its
    37	applications, which are comparable to standalone products in features. For
    38	example, the Enable Office word processor has an integrated spell checker
    39	and thesaurus, with optional grammar checker. Enable Office also provides
    40	a 3D, linking spreadsheet, built-in SQL in a relational database, 3D
    41	graphics, and a communications module with scripting capabilities.
    42	Integration between modules makes it easy to share data across
    43	applications.
    44	
    45	Enable Office features a simplified interface to Enable applications with
    46	easy-to-use pull-down menus and full mouse support. As many as eight
    47	different windows can be open at once on a screen, and users can move data
    48	from one module to another. Communication between Enable modules allows a
    49	graph to be redrawn automatically, for example, when information on a
    50	spreadsheet is changed. In addition, each module can import data from and
    51	export to popular standalone applications.
    52	
    53	Send and Receive Higgins E-Mail
    54	
    55	Enable Office provides Higgins electronic mail functions for four users,
    56	including calendars, group scheduling, and a keyword-based message
    57	retrieval system.
    58	
    59	The ability to send electronic mail from within Enable applications is a
    60	new feature of Enable Office, according to Sinopoli. A word processing
    61	document, for example, can be sent as an electronic mail message by
    62	bringing up a Higgins mail addressing menu. A cover note can be sent with
    63	the file, as well.
    64	
    65	A user is notified of incoming messages by visual and audible alerts. Word
    66	processing files, spreadsheets, or other Enable documents sent as
    67	attachments to electronic mail messages can be viewed without calling up
    68	the original program.
    69	
    70	Price and Availability
    71	
    72	Enable Office is now in beta testing and will be available for customer
    73	shipment later this spring. Introductory list price for a four-user
    74	officepak is $995. Enable products are distributed by Ingram Micro,
    75	Merisel, Egghead, and others. Enable Office requires DOS 3.3 or higher,
    76	640K memory and a hard drive. It supports all major network operating
    77	systems.
    78	
    79	Enable Software is a leading developer of software for personal computers
    80	with more than a million users worldwide. The company, based in Ballston
    81	Lake, N.Y., has sales offices throughout the United States, Europe, and

    83	people.
