     1	February 10, 1992 -- Austin, Texas -- Thomas-Conrad has added three Micro
     2	Channel Adapters to its 100Mbps TCNS family. These adapters support
     3	100Mbps transmission over coaxial, shielded twisted-pair (STP), and
     4	fiber-optic cable.
     5	
     6	100Mbps TCNS provides affordable workstation connections. At a cost of less
     7	than $1,250 per connection for coaxial or STP media, TCNS Micro Channel is
     8	significantly less expensive than other proposed 100Mbps solutions over
     9	copper- or fiber-based cabling, including FDDI.
    10	
    11	According to Robert Barton, TCNS product line manager for Thomas-Conrad
    12	Corporation, Many users in the IBM community with Micro Channel machines
    13	need TCNS to provide the extra bandwidth they don't see with 16Mbps token
    14	ring. For applications such as multimedia or image processing, TCNS Is at
    15	a definite advantage."
    16	
    17	TCNS is a token-passing, deterministic technology that is configured in a
    18	distributed-star topology for easy network maintenance. It supports a
    19	maximum of 255 nodes per network. The TCNS technology operates with
    20	standard linkable, ODI and NDIS ARCNET drivers. These drivers allow TCNS
    21	to operate in NetWare, LAN Manager, LAN Server, VINES, and POWER-LAN
    22	environments. In addition, TCNS is compatible at the OSI Network Layer
    23	with FDDI, Ethernet, token ring, and ARCNET LANs.
    24	
    25	The TCNS technology is optimized for use in imaging, document processing,
    26	database management, and other environments where large amounts of data
    27	need to move across the LAN quickly. TCNS first shipped one and a half
    28	years ago, and it has rapidly gained market acceptance because the speed
    29	it offers has not been available at an affordable cost previously.
    30	
    31	At present, TCNS operates on RG62/U coax, Type 1 STP, and fiber-optic
    32	media, offering a wide range of connection costs and distances. On coax
    33	and STP, TCNS offers an easy upgrade path for users of ARCNET and token
    34	ring networks.
    35	
    36	Three TC3046 adapters will be available for IBM Type 1 shielded
    37	twisted-pair, RG62/U coaxial, and fiberoptic media. The TC3046-STP will
    38	list for $995; the TC3046-CX will list for $995; and, the TC3046 ST will
    39	list for $1,395. The adapters will be available in the early second
    40	quarter of 1992. Thomas-Conrad markets its TCNS adapters and hubs through
    41	a worldwide network of distributors.

    44	
    45	February 11, 1992 -- Thomas-Conrad has announced 8-bit 100Mbps TCNS
    46	adapters in coax and shielded twisted-pair (STP) implementations, which
    47	are significantly less expensive than other proposed 100Mbps solutions
    48	over copper-based cable, including FDDI. The 8-bit adapters allow good
    49	performance in the large population of 8088- and 286-based workstations
    50	presently installed.
    51	
    52	According to Jeff Chumbley, director of strategic planning for
    53	Thomas-Conrad Corporation, "Introducing TCNS for 8-bit processors on
    54	copper-based media brings 100Mbps technology into the reach of users for
    55	whom FDDI is too expensive and for whom upgrading to more powerful
    56	workstations is not an alternative. TCNS on copper satisfies distances of
    57	150 meters on shielded twisted-pair and 100 meters on coax. It offers a
    58	feasible upgrade plan for existing token ring or ARCNET users that have
    59	coax or shielded twisted-pair already installed."
    60	
    61	TCNS Is a token-passing, deterministic technology that is configured in a
    62	distributed-star topology for easy network maintenance, and supports a
    63	maximum of 255 nodes per network. The TCNS technology operates with
    64	standard ODI or NDIS drivers and accelerated ARCNET drivers, and offers
    65	interoperability at the OSI Network layer with FDDI, Ethernet, token ring,
    66	and ARCNET LANs. Because TCNS uses ARCNET drivers and operates on media
    67	commonly Installed in ARCNET and token ring network, it offers an easy
    68	upgrade path for ARCNET and token ring networks. TCNS can operate in
    69	NetWare, LAN Manager, LAN Server, Banyan VINES, and Performance Technology
    70	s POWERlan environments, thus allowing easy system Interoperability.
    71	
    72	The TCNS technology has been shipping for one and a half years and is
    73	marketed worldwide through a network of distributors.
    74	
    75	The two 8-bit copper-based adapters, the TC3042-STP TCNS Adapter/AT for
    76	shielded twisted-pair cable and the TC3042-CX TCNS Adapter/AT for coaxial
    77	cable list for $595. The adapters will be available late this quarter.
    78	
    79	--------------------------------------------------------
    80	
    81	February 11, 1992 -- Thomas-Conrad has added 16/32-bit bus-mastering Micro
    82	Channel 10BASE-T and 10BASE-2 Ethernet adapters to its Ethernet product
    83	family. The TC5046-T 10BASE-T Ethernet Adapter is one of the first 32bit
    84	Micro Channel adapter on the market. The TC5046-2 offers both a 10BASE-2
    85	connection and an AUI connector. Because these adapters use a full 32 bits
    86	for addressing and data you can receive increased performance on your LAN
    87	when you substitute them for other Micro Channel Ethernet adapters
    88	presently available.
    89	
    90	Both the TC5046-T and the TC5046-2 adapters use the National Semiconductor
    91	SONIC chipset, which provides support for increased network management and
    92	diagnosis. The adapters have on-board LEDs that indicate collisions,
    93	transmission and receipt of data, and reverse polarity--features that help
    94	the network manager isolate and diagnose network problems. The Micro
    95	Channel adapters are software configurable for easy installation and
    96	comply with the IEEE 802.3 specification for Ethernet.
    97	
    98	According to Jeff Chumbley, director of strategic planning for
    99	Thomas-Conrad, "The TC5046 adapters offer superior performance with their
   100	bus-mastering design and full 32-bit driver support for both servers and
   101	workstations. These adapters are ideal for high-performance 32-bit file
   102	servers and workstations, and can also be used in 16-bit Micro Channel
   103	machines."
   104	
   105	The TC5046-T and TC5046-2 are also available in conveniently packaged
   106	six-pack bundles for $2,529, a savings of 9% over individually packaged
   107	adapters.
   108	
   109	The TC5046 Ethernet Adapter/MC will ship in early the second quarter in
   110	10BASE-T and 10BASE-2 versions, both priced at $449. In addition,
   111	Thomas-Conrad manufactures 8/16-bit NE1000/2000 compatible adapters and
   112	bus-mastering, 16-bit Ethernet adapters. The 8- and 16-bit adapters
   113	support 10BASE-T, 10BASE-2, and 10BASE-5 environments. An eight-port
   114	10BASE-T concentrator and 10BASE-T and 10BASE-2 transceivers are also
   115	currently shipping.

   118	
   119	January 20, 1992 -- Starting February 1 and extending through March 31,
   120	1992, Thomas-Conrad will give users $50 in exchange for each ARCNET
   121	adapter they trade-in for a 100Mbps TCNS RG62/U coax adapter. For those
   122	users that need extra performance or have applications that require more
   123	than ARCNET's 2.5Mbps transmission rate, TCNS is an ideal choice. With
   124	this offer, users can recoup part of their initial ARCNET investment.
   125	Approximately 4,000,000 ARCNET adapters are presently installed, many of
   126	which run on RG62/U coaxial cable. Because TCNS is also available for
   127	RG62/U coax, users can install it without rewiring their ARCNET LANs.
   128	
   129	Thomas-Conrad will accept any vendor's ARCNET adapters, regardless of the
   130	adapter's condition.
   131	
   132	According to Jeff Chumbley, director of strategic planning for
   133	Thomas-Conrad, "Many users bought ARCNET because it is reliable,
   134	Inexpensive, and easy to troubleshoot. These same users have been waiting
   135	for sometime for 20Mbps ARCNETPlus. With TCNS, they don't need to wait any
   136	longer--a high-speed ARCNET-like access method is available today."
   137	
   138	TCNS is a 100Mbps local area network technology optimized for high-volume
   139	and transaction-processing applications. The adapters work with most
   140	popular network operating systems including Novell's NetWare, Banyan's
   141	VINES, Artisoft's LANTastic, and Performance Technology's POWERLan. TCNS
   142	adapters require no software changes to existing ARCNET networks and use
   143	only 16KB of address space. The TCNS adapter drivers support multiple
   144	memory address and IRQ options to provide installation flexibility with
   145	other add-in cards. Thus, several network adapters, including TCNS can be
   146	internally routed in a file server or dedicated device. The adapters,
   147	which use fiber-optic, Type 1 shielded twisted-pair, or RG62/U coaxial
   148	cable, operate under currently available Novell RX-Net drivers or
   149	Thomas-Conrad's Accelerated ARCNET Drivers for NetWare. The TCNS adapters
   150	connect to the network via the TCNS Smart Hub, a diagnostic hub that
   151	supports Thomas-Conrad's HubTalkn', a network hub manager.
   152

   156	--------------------------------------------------------
   157	
   158	January 23, 1992 -- Effective January 20, Thomas-Conrad is dropping the
   159	prices of its ARCNET adapters by 12-20%. The new prices will be $110 for
   160	TC6242 8-bit coax adapters, $120 for TC6242-OTP 8-bit industry-standard
   161	twisted-pair adapters, and $325 for TC6245 16-bit coax adapters.
   162	
   163	The company has also dropped prices on many of its "Six-Pack to Go"
   164	bundles. These bundled packs offer a savings of up to 30% over
   165	individually packaged adapters and include an offer for six free boot
   166	ROMs. The company's TC6242 8-bit coax six-packs are $595; its TC6242 8-bit
   167	industry-standard twisted-pair six-packs are $665; and The TC6245 16-bit
   168	coax six-packs are $1,325.
   169	
   170	According to Jeff Chumbley, director of strategic planning for
   171	Thomas-Conrad, "As a result of our commitment to World Class Manufacturing
   172	techniques and continual, rapid improvement, we have achieved cost savings
   173	in the manufacture of our ARCNET product line. In keeping with our
   174	corporate philosophy of offering high quality, technically innovative LAN
   175	products at affordable prices, we are passing these savings on to our
   176	customers."
   177	
   178	These ARCNET adapters include an on-bracket node ID switch and an activity
   179	LED for easy configuration and maintenance. Existing ARCNET drivers,
   180	including RX-Net drivers and Thomas-Conrad's accelerated ARCNET drivers,
   181	are compatible with the TC6242 and TC6245 family of adapters. As with
   182	other Thomas-Conrad ARCNET adapters, the TC6242s and TC6245s operate with
   183	Novell NetWare, Banyan VINES, Performance Technology POWERLan, Artisoft
   184	LANtastic, and the various implementations of Microsoft's LAN Manager.
