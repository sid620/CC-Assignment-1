     1	BOSTON, Mass. (February 11, 1992) -- Tallgrass Technologies Corporation
     2	today announced the FS3000, a 2.7 gigabyte QIC tape device. The FS3000 is
     3	positioned as a high performance device for back up and restore on
     4	extremely high performance networks where speed requirements exceed
     5	existing QIC and DAT technologies.
     6	
     7	The FS3000 triples the performance of other technologies with a transfer
     8	rate of up to 36 Megabytes per minute. An industry first, the FS3000 can
     9	backup a full Gigabyte of data in 1/2 hour. The FS3000 utilizes the
    10	QIC-1350 specification and stores 2.7 GB with data compression on a single
    11	cartridge. An extended length data cartridge will be available by year
    12	end, allowing the FS3000 to store up to 3.2 gigabytes on a single
    13	cartridge. Because the drive supports Quick File Access, the FS3000 can
    14	seek out any file in an average of 30 seconds in a restore operation, even
    15	providing fast restore of compressed files.
    16	
    17	"Time critical applications are best served by this new system. With a
    18	backup speed of 1 GB per half hour, a typical 300 MB Novell network can do
    19	backups and restores in under 10 minutes . The FS3000 offers the user an
    20	alternative to more costly technologies," stated Ernest H. Wassmann,
    21	President and CEO of Tallgrass.
    22	
    23	The FS3000 offers data integrity that exceeds less than one unrecoverable
    24	error in 1015 bits, the highest in the industry, as well as unmatched
    25	reliability by achieving an 80,000 hour MTBF. The FS3000 provides an
    26	automatic cartridge loading mechanism that is more advanced than
    27	traditional swing-head design, assuring user convenience and data
    28	security.
    29	
    30	The FS3000 is a 5.25" half height device supporting the tape command set of
    31	SCSI-II. It is supported by DOS, NetWare, UNIX, XENIX, OS/2 and Macintosh
    32	environments for both ISA and MCA bus computers.
    33	
    34	Suggested retail pricing for the FS3000 starts at $4,495 for an internal
    35	ISA model and ranges to $4,995 for an external MCA model. All drives are
    36	shipped with FileSECURE software, SCSI host adapter, cables, power cord,
    37	and Magnus data cartridge.
    38

    40	solutions. Established in 1981, Tallgrass supports an installed base in

    47	tape backup systems to its distributor partners.
