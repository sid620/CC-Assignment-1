    10	    Several of my friends who are Amiga owners have had problems with the
    11	   internal drive. This modification will overcome that problem by
    12	   allowing Amiga 500 owners to boot from df1:.
    13	
    14	    This mod is also useful for people who own the Commodore 5 1/4 inch
    15	   drives and wish to boot from them. More importantly, people who have
    16	   added an 80trk 5 1/4 inch drive (such as myself) as described in the
    17	   file ADD_5.25_DRIVE can boot from it. As 5 1/4 inch disks can be
    18	   bought for as low as $5.95 for 10 in some places, it is well worth
    19	   considering as a cheap backup library option OR indeed as an
    20	   alternative primary storage medium.
    21	
    22	      You will need the following tools and parts:
    23	
    24	      * Low wattage soldering iron, suitable for PCB's
    25	      * DPDT switch mini toggle variety is fine
    26	      * 1 foot of ribbon cable
    27	      * solder
    28	      * small snippers
    29	      * hand drill
    30	      * tool to unscrew the @#$%^& non-standard case screws
    31	      * Exacto knife or similar
    32	
    33	    Start by unscrewing the 6 hex style screws around the edge of the
    34	   case (Goodbye warranty!).  Do not remove the three phillips screws as
    35	   they are holding the drive in place.  Turn the machine back the right
    36	   way up and remove the lid by pressing around the edge to ease off the
    37	   catches.  Remove the keyboard making careful note of the orientation of
    38	   the connector on the main board!!!!!  Now remove the further 4 hex
    39	   screws which are holding the top rf shield in place and remove the
    40	   shield.  Unplug the disk drive POWER cable from the drive end only.
    41	
    42	    Remove the 34-way disk drive patch lead taking note of its orientation
    43	   (This saves so much time when you have forgotten later on!)  Unscrew
    44	   the Disk drive unit and remove it.
    45	
    46	    The main PC board should now come free with the lower RF shield.
    47	   Unscrew the hexagonal socket retainers on the I/O connectors at the
    48	   rear of the board and this shield should come free.
    49	
    50	    You are now ready to start!
    51	
    52	    Locate connector 11 (CN11) on the component side, this is the socket
    53	   that you just unplugged the disk drive patch lead from.  In front of it
    54	   should be U8 which is an 8520 chip.
    55	
    56	    CN11 is 2 rows of 34 pins.Count along the front row from the right
    57	   hand side until you see the 5th and 6th pins (pins 9 and 11 of the
    58	   connector respectively).  There should be two circuit traces that lead
    59	   from these pins and disappear under U8.  Using the exacto knife cut
    60	   both of these traces leaving no stray copper. A 1mm cut should be
    61	   sufficient.
    62	
    63	    Turn the board over to the solder side.
    64	    Leave the board for a moment and get the DPDT switch.
    65	    For ease I will label its pins as such:
    66	
    67	        A   B
    68	
    69	        C   D
    70	
    71	        E   F
    72	
    73	    Cut a piece of ribbon cable about 1' long with 4 conductors.
    74	    Strip and tin the wires then connect them to A, B, C and D.
    75	    Cut two small pieces of wire and connect A-F and E-B.
    76	
    77	    Tin and strip the other ends of the ribbon cable.Using the snippers
    78	   trim these tinned ends until there is about 1 1/2 to 2mm showing. Any
    79	   longer is unnecessary and can lead to solder blobs etc.
    80	
    81	    Grab the Amiga pc board again. On the solder side locate pins 9 and
    82	   11 of CN11 as described earlier. Solder the lead from A to pin 9 and
    83	   the lead from B to pin 11.
    84	
    85	    Locate pins 13 and 14 of U8.
    86	
    87	    If you are unsure of pin numbering on IC's refer to one of the data
    88	   sections of DSE's or ROD Irving catalogues.  Otherwise looking at the
    89	   chip there is a notch at the right hand end of the board. Pin 1 is
    90	   behind this notch (relative to the pc board) and the numbers increase
    91	   in an anti-clockwise fashion around the chip.  Solder the lead from C
    92	   to pin 13 of U8 and the lead from D to pin 14 of U8.  That completes
    93	   the soldering side of things.
    94	
    95	    All that remains is to drill a hole for the switch and put the rest
    96	   back together. There is a convenient spot to the right of the joystick
    97	   socket that will house 3 or 4 switches comfortably.
    98	
    99	    PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE be careful of the orientation of the connectors
   100	   when assembling your amiga.
   101	
   102	    To use the mod:
   103	             1. Remove ALL disks from ALL drives.
   104	             2. Flick the switch to the NORMAL position.
   105	             3. Turn the machine ON or reset if already ON.
   106	             4. If you wish to boot from drive DF1: now is the time to
   107	                flick the switch to the NON-standard position.
   108	             5. Insert the appropriate disks in the appropriate drives.
   109	
   110	    HOW it works.
   111	   The mod works by switching the drive select lines SEL_0 and SEL_1.
   112	   SIMPLE!
   113	
   114	    IMPORTANT:!!
   115	   The switch must be in the NORMAL position when you either turn the
   116	   machine on or reset.The reason for this is that after a cold or warm
   117	   boot the KERNEL roms go looking for what equipment is connected to the
   118	   system. A part of the GARY chip which is triggered by the SEL_0 signal
   119	   provides seperate MOTOR_ON signals for the internal and external
   120	   drives. When the switch is in the ALTERED position the GARY chip is
   121	   fed by the SEL_1 signal and surprise surprise! the KERNEL roms won't
   122	   find the internal drive!  However is is PERFECTLY safe to change the
   123	   switch at ANY time the power is on (without disks in the drives!). So
   124	   if the switch is changed after the roms have found what drives are
   125	   online, the drives 0 and 1 will operate fine only reversed.  More
   126	   circuitry could have been added to swap the motor_on signals so that
   127	   this extra switching wasn't required, however most people would
   128	   probably like to keep their mods to the main pcb to a MINIMUM!
   129	
   130	    *NOTE*
   131	   If the switch is changed while disks are inserted in the drives,
   132	   AmigaDOS will become confused as to what volumes are on line and if
   133	   your write-protect tags are OFF, chances are your directories will be
   134	   CLOBBERED!!
   135	
   136	    The mod is relatively simple, however if you are unsure of your
   137	   ability to perform it.. DON'T. get some hardware oriented person to
   138	   help or drop me a line at PARAGON bbs if in Sydney, or via Megadisc and
   139	   I may be able to help or do it for you at a small nominal cost.
   140	   Naturally I cannot guarantee your labour content so therefore I cannot
   141	   make any warranties, implied or otherwise, as to the suitability or
   142	   performance of this modification.  However I can say that I am not too
   143	   worried about my software collection as I have a set of bootable 5 1/4"
   144	   backups!!
   145	
   146	    Good luck and I hope that this is of some help.
