     5	First some disclaimers from PowerPC News: Modifying your Macintosh in
     6	any of the ways below will certainly void your machine's warrantee. In
     7	addition you will be driving your machine's processor faster than Apple 
     8	designed it to go, and therefore the possibility of long-term damage to
     9	the machine does exist. PowerPC News can not recommend that you modify
    10	your Macintosh and we are providing this information on an as-is basis
    11	and cannot be responsible if the result is a non-functional machine, or
    12	indeed a sticky smoking blob in the middle of your desk. The following
    13	file is republished from the ftp site sumex.stanford.edu where it is

    21	Mac Crystal Oscillator Speedup History 2.3                April 1994 
    22	There has been a great deal of interest expressed over the net about 
    23	these simple and inexpensive Macintosh modifications that yield 20- 40%
    24	speed increases.  Over the last year or so I have been doing a  fair
    25	amount of crystal oscillator swapping/acceleration on Mac's,  and
    26	gathering information from others.  I've made several posts to 
    27	comp.sys.mac.hardware with the bulk of this info and as new  machines
    28	come out, and new concerns surface, I will try to add them  to this
    29	history of the modifications, post them on  comp.sys.mac.hardware and
    30	make them available for anonymous ftp  on sumex-aim.stanford.edu in
    31	/info-mac/info/hdwr.  Included in this  version is some of the news on
    32	the PowerMac's and Marlin Prowell's  new C650 modification.
    33	
    34	A little background:
    35	All computers operate at a certain frequency with which operations  are
    36	performed.  Within a certain class of computers, for example  Mac's with
    37	a 68030 processor, the higher the frequency, the higher  frequency of
    38	operations processed, and the faster the computer  provided there is no
    39	other speed effecting hardware like a cache or  slow data path.  The
    40	designer of the computer, Apple in this case, will use components that
    41	are rated at the same frequency or faster  than the final computer will
    42	be.  The 68030's are made by Motorola.   All 68030's are generally alike
    43	in what they do, but they are not  alike in how fast they can do it. 
    44	Motorola sells several 68030  processors rated at 16, 20, 25, 33, 40 and
    45	50MHz for Mac's,  accelerators and such.  A large frequency difference
    46	will require a  different mask during production of the processor, but
    47	small changes  may not.  Motorola only needs to guarantee that the chip
    48	they mark  as 20MHz will function properly at 20MHz under a variety of 
    49	conditions.  Some chip vendors will test parts at different  frequencies
    50	and sort the chips accordingly while others may just  label the them at
    51	will and sell the chips at the different price as  long as they are
    52	within spec.  So it is possible that the 20 and 25's  actually come from
    53	the same batch, are separated on demand, and  tested to make sure they
    54	will withstand that frequency.  Because of  this, it is possible that a
    55	20MHz processor will function fine at a  higher frequency, say 25MHz. 
    56	Running it faster will however  generate more heat.  
    57	
    58	Many of the components in the computer need to be synchronized, so  a
    59	frequency is generated by a crystal oscillator to synchronize them.  
    60	Other parts like NuBus cards and video do not have to be the same 
    61	frequency, so they may have separate crystal oscillators.  A typical 
    62	computer may have several crystal oscillators to clock different  groups
    63	of components on the motherboard.  Provided the components  that are
    64	clocked by a particular crystal oscillator are capable of a  speed
    65	increase, that crystal oscillator may be replaced with one of a  higher
    66	frequency.  How much a specific Mac can be sped up by this  method
    67	depends on how the motherboard was designed, the  components used, and
    68	what things the crystal oscillator that  controls the processor also
    69	controls.  With some of the newer Mac's,  there are a few MHz
    70	differences in the top speeds reported for the  same model, so part of
    71	this is luck of the draw. 
    72	
    73	This crystal oscillator swapping has been done for years, and some 
    74	early computers even had jumpers that made it really easy to  disable
    75	one oscillator and enable another higher frequency one.  The  first
    76	Mac's to be modified were the IIsi's.  A stock IIsi's runs at  20MHz,
    77	and IIci's at 25MHz, and since the architecture of these  machines was
    78	so similar it seemed reasonable to run a IIsi at IIci  speeds.  Another
    79	important factor was that earlier Mac's had just  one crystal oscillator
    80	that controlled everything, and if you replaced  it you would mess
    81	things up.  The IIsi was different as some noted  through its frequency
    82	deviation from its 8 and 16MHz precursors  where the main frequency was
    83	halved and quartered to run the CPU,  serial ports, video...  The IIsi
    84	was different, it had 4 crystal  oscillators, only one of which
    85	controlled the processor speed. 
    86	The Crystal Oscillator:
    87	The type of crystal oscillator in the early Mac's is a full size, 14 pin 
    88	package, TTL type crystal oscillator.  It is a rectangular metal can, 
    89	with approximate dimensions of 2.0 x 1.3cm and typically about 0.3-
    90	0.6cm high.  All crystal oscillators have 4 pins.  Some are numbered 
    91	1,2,3,4 and others 1,7,8,14.  Pin 1 is always the pin next to the 
    92	pointed edge (the others are rounded), with the dot, or next to the 
    93	indentation on the newer CMOS, or surface mount crystal oscillators.  
    94	With the pins facing down, put the dot, or indentation to your left, 
    95	and the pin on the left, closest to you is pin 1.  Going counter 
    96	clockwise, pin 2 (or 7, depending on what numbering scheme) is to  the
    97	right, Pin 3(8) right side and further away, and 4(14) left side,  and
    98	further away.  Pin 1 on all the newer Mac's with surface mount  crystal
    99	oscillators, and some of the older ones is an output  enable/disable pin
   100	(OE).  On some of the crystal oscillators you  purchase Pin 1 will be
   101	OE, yet on many it will not be used (no  contact (NC)).  It is not
   102	important which you get as you will not be  using the output enable
   103	feature.  Pin 2(7) is a ground.  Pin 3(8) is the  output.  Pin 4(14) is
   104	the supply voltage, +5 VDC.  I've checked a few  of the older type
   105	Mac's, and the oscillator on Mac Plus's is not OE,  while the ones on
   106	the IIsi's and Quadra 700's are OE.  I'm not sure  why Apple uses these
   107	type of oscillators instead of the ones where  pin 1 is not used.  I
   108	guess it is possible that something on the circuit  board can ground pin
   109	1 and stop or restart the computer.  If anyone  knows, please let me
   110	know.  Printed on the crystal oscillator will be  its manufacturer, part
   111	numbers, and frequency.  On these early Mac's,  the processor runs at
   112	half the speed of the oscillator, so a 20MHz  Mac IIsi has a 40MHz
   113	crystal oscillator.  
   114	
   115	There are several different modification techniques.  They will all 
   116	give you the same final max speed.  Some are just easier or more 
   117	elegant than others.  As with all these modifications, even though 
   118	there may be no visible sign that you modified your Mac, you have 
   119	voided the warranty on the Mac.  As Apple states: 
   120	"This warranty does not apply if the product has been damaged by 
   121	accident, abuse, misuse, or misapplication; if the product has been 
   122	modified without the written permission of Apple; or if any Apple 
   123	serial number has been removed or defaced."
   124	
   125	
   126	This is what I seem to be finding.  These numbers vary from Mac to  Mac,
   127	so these are just averages.  Some machines will go faster than  this. 
   128	These are the oscillators that Output Enablers ships in their  kits.

   152	
   153	
   154	
   155	Mod-1
   156	
   157	The basic idea of Modification #1 is removing the onboard oscillator, 
   158	and replacing it with a faster one.  This is the mod most people use  on
   159	the IIsi, Q700, Q900, & Q950.
   160	
   161	The basic procedure used is that you have to unsolder the TTL  crystal
   162	oscillator from the motherboard on the Mac, and put in a new  one. 
   163	Instead of putting one straight onto the board, it is nice to use  a
   164	socket so you can test your individual Mac, and see what the cutoff 
   165	frequency is, and you can always put the original oscillator back in 
   166	the socket.
   167	
   168	First find the crystal oscillator by referring to the previous table 
   169	and description of physical characteristics.  Be careful when you 
   170	remove the oscillator.  Most people just use a normal soldering iron, 
   171	and are fine; a grounded (three prong soldering iron) would be a bit 
   172	safer.  They just use copper wick to soak up the solder from all four 
   173	pins, and pop out the proper oscillator.  Because the boards are 
   174	multilayer, be careful not to damage anything; be gentle.  There was 
   175	recently one report of a guy who damaged his IIsi board doing this.  
   176	But that was the only incident I had ever heard of, and lots and lots 
   177	of people have done this.  I use a "desoldering iron".  They melt the 
   178	solder, and have a pump to suck out the solder while you swirl the  pin
   179	from the oscillator around to get all the solder out.  After you  have
   180	done all 4, if you have done a good job, the oscillator just pops  out. 
   181	If you have access to one of these desoldering irons, I highly  suggest
   182	you use it as it does a cleaner job, and there is less risk of  burning
   183	(discoloring) the board.  Next, take a 14 pin IC socket,  remove all the
   184	pins but 1,7,8, and 14, and solder it into the board  (see Modification
   185	#3 for a Digi-key part number).  Make sure you put  it in so pin 1 will
   186	go into pin 1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4.  And the notch in the  socket should face
   187	the same way the dot on the old oscillator was  facing.  Now just put in
   188	a faster oscillator.
   189	
   190	I have done this to a few IIsi, and the highest frequency we could get 
   191	to work without problems was 27.5MHz.  Thus a speed increase from  20 to
   192	27.5MHz.  The actual crystal is 55MHz (double the frequency).   TTL
   193	55MHz crystal oscillators do exist, but they are rare.  The thing  most
   194	people seem to do is get a CMOS oscillator, and they work just  fine. 
   195	Digi-Key sells a 55MHz CMOS crystal oscillator in a 14 pin  package,
   196	part# SE1509.  At 58.9 and above, there are problems with  the floppy
   197	drive; you cannot boot the Mac from a floppy, but other  than that it is
   198	fine until just over 30MHz.  I recently had a IIsi at  28.3MHz and it
   199	was fine.  Be warned that some cards may not work  after this
   200	modification.  Most will work at 25MHz, but will not at  27.5MHz, so
   201	just stick with 25MHz if that is the case. 
   202	The IIsi does not come with a heatsink, so to reduce the heat in the 
   203	processor, get a small heat sink to attach to the 68030 to cool it 
   204	down; any heat sink will do; the more surface area the faster heat  will
   205	be dissipated.  Be careful when you put on the heat sink.   Typically
   206	you'll use some heat transfer grease, but the heat sink can  slide off
   207	if the Mac is moved, and the heat sink might short  something out.  The
   208	best thing seems to be to get a heat sink with a  hole in the middle, or
   209	drill one yourself, use the heat transfer  grease, but also put a small
   210	drop of super glue through the hole in  the heat sink onto the chip or
   211	put a drop on the side, and this should  hold it in place.  Fry's sells
   212	nice heat sink/fan combo's.  They run $10  and up, and I think they are
   213	more than you need, but it should keep  the processor cooler.  I believe
   214	they come with a Y cable to tap into  your hard drive power cable to
   215	power the fan.  A more complete FAQ  on this modification for a IIsi is
   216	available via anonymous ftp from  sumex.stanford.edu in
   217	info-mac/info/hdwr (iisi-25mhz-upgrade- faq.txt).
   218	
   219	For the Quadra 700 and 900, you can get 70MHz TTL crystals from  Fry's. 
   220	The 70MHz may not work, and you may have to back down to  66.6666MHz,
   221	the next most common frequency, Digi-Key part#  CTX137.  The Q700, Q900,
   222	and Q950 come with a heatsink installed.   A more complete file on this
   223	modification for a Quadra 700 is also  available via anonymous ftp from
   224	sumex.stanford.edu in info- mac/info/hdwr
   225	(quadra-700-clock-mod-145.txt).
   226	
   227	It has been reported for, but I have not yet done a Q950, but the 
   228	general idea is the same.  If anyone has any more info on doing a  Q950,
   229	please e-mail me and I'll add it.
   230	
   231	
   232	Mod-2
   233	
   234	The basic idea of Modification #2 is to disable the onboard  oscillator
   235	with a jumper and feed in a new signal on the back of the  board.  There
   236	are very few who have performed this mod, but I feel it  is more elegant
   237	and safer since you don't have to remove the onboard  oscillator.  This
   238	newer, and less evasive method has been performed  on IIsi's & Q700's by
   239	myself, and should work fine on the Q900 &  Q950.
   240	
   241	The most difficult and risky part of "Mod-1" above is the removal of 
   242	the oscillator, and this is an alternative procedure that gets around 
   243	that since the crystal oscillators Apple uses have pin 1 as OE.  On a 
   244	crystal oscillator with pin 1 as OE, if you ground pin 1, you disable 
   245	the output from pin 3(8), and you can feed a new signal into pin 3(8) 
   246	without removing the original crystal oscillator. Several months ago I
   247	performed this modification on a Quadra 700 by  tacking (soldering) a
   248	jumper on the back of the motherboard between  pins 1 and 2(7) of the
   249	50MHz oscillator, and ran wires about 8 inches  long each from pins
   250	2(7), 3(8), and 4(14) to a 14 pin socket attached  to the inside of the
   251	Q700 with pins in positions 7, 8, and 14.  Into  this we placed a 70MHz
   252	crystal oscillator and the Mac ran fine at  35MHz and is still doing
   253	fine.  This modification is nice in that it is  a bit less risky as far
   254	as damage to the motherboard, but you have to  be careful to use thin
   255	wires in order to make clean solder joints.   With this modification you
   256	could remove the wires at a later date to  return to the original
   257	configuration more cleanly.  I cannot say for  sure if this will work on
   258	a Q900 or Q950 until I put one of those  crystals on a scope, or
   259	actually try the modification, but am pretty  sure it will.  If anyone
   260	has removed a crystal from a Q900 or Q950  and still has it, I'd be glad
   261	to check it out and send it back to you. 
   262	
   263	Mod-3
   264	
   265	The basic idea of modification #3 is building a clip that disables the 
   266	onboard oscillator, and feeds in a new, faster signal.  The beauty of 
   267	this modification over the others is that you do not have to do any 
   268	soldering on the motherboard itself, just on the part you clip onto  the
   269	surface mount crystal oscillator in your Mac.  This is the  modification
   270	most people use on the C610, C650, C660av, Q610,  Q650, Q660av, Q800,
   271	Q840av, PM6100, PM7100, PM8100. 
   272	The really neat thing about this came into play in February 1992  when
   273	Apple released the Centris 610, 650, and Quadra 800.  In these  machines
   274	and since, Apple has been using surface mount crystal  oscillators.  Now
   275	that Apple was using surface mount crystal  oscillators, there was
   276	plenty of accessible area on the metal tabs of  the oscillator.  In June
   277	'93 Guy Kuo reported the first crystal swap  of sorts on a Centris 610
   278	to the net.  He soldered pins 3, 5, 10, and  12 of a 14 pin socket
   279	directly onto the surface mount crystal  oscillator.  Because the pins
   280	on a TTL type crystal oscillator are at  positions 1, 7, 8, and 14, he
   281	made jumpers between pins 5-7, 8-10,  and 12-14.  He disabled the
   282	on-board surface mount crystal  oscillator with a jumper between 3-5. 
   283	Then put the new crystal in  the socket.  This file is also available on
   284	SUMEX in info- mac/info/hdwr (centris-610-clock-mod-11).
   285	I was a little hesitant about soldering onto my new Quadra 800, so 
   286	wrote to him a few days later about using a surface mount test clip, 
   287	and asked his thoughts.  He suspected I could not find a reasonable 
   288	test clip, but otherwise believed it would work.  A few days later  the
   289	3M surface mount test clip arrived, and the test clip worked  perfectly. 
   290	I was running my Quadra 800 at 40MHz, with no problems,  and best of all
   291	the modification was all contained in a simple little  clip that could
   292	be removed without trace at will.  And thus the  removable test clip
   293	approach was born.  My Q800 even worked at  48MHz as long as I did not
   294	access the serial ports.  A few days later  I got several crystals, and
   295	found the highest frequency on my Quadra  800 to be 42.0MHz.  Since then
   296	I've tried it at 42.106MHz, and the  serial ports did not work, so the
   297	cutoff for my Q800 was at 42.0MHz.   If you never use your serial ports,
   298	48MHz worked fine for me, while  at 50MHz my Mac was not happy and would
   299	not boot.   
   300	So if you are still interested, you will need a surface mount test 
   301	clip; 3M and Pomona make them, and I prefer the 3M ones.  Make sure  you
   302	get a surface mount test clip.  The I.C. test clips also work, but I 
   303	prefer the surface mount SOIC (small outline integrated circuit)  ones. 
   304	A 10, 12, 14, 16, or 18 pin clip will be fine.  I'd say go with a  14 or
   305	16 narrow or wide.

   308	16 pin, part# 923650-16-ND  $6.96
   309	
   310	These are the part numbers for the ones with alloy leads; I used to 
   311	recommend the gold coated ones, but the resistance/corrosion effect  is
   312	minimal.
   313	
   314	You will also need a 14 pin IC socket, there are plenty of types.  The 
   315	machined pin ones are nice because you can pop out the pins that are 
   316	not needed to get them out of the way since you only need three pins  in
   317	the socket. 
   318	
   319	14 pin IC socket w/tin pins, part# ED3114  $0.57 
   320	You will also need an oscillator (more on this later), a little wire, 
   321	soldering iron, solder, and possibly heat sink depending on the 
   322	machine.  For a C610, C660av, Q610, and Q660av you should add a  heat
   323	sink, HS160-ND is the 0.600 inch one, and is plenty ($3.98). 
   324	The others already have heat sinks, and do not get too hot.  I had an 
   325	extra fan with my Q800, but removed it, and it has been fine.  The  heat
   326	sinks come with the clips needed to attach them to the chip.   These are
   327	a bit of a pain, you just have to work at it for a while.   There may be
   328	several ways to do it, but I just slide the clips on from  the side. 
   329	Sometimes they fall off half way there, but eventually it  works.  Some
   330	people have been using the heat sink/fan combo's.  I  have not, but they
   331	seem to work fine as well.  The new Q610 and  Q660av computers are based
   332	on a new mask of the 68040 that comes  at 25MHz without a heatsink
   333	(There is an "H" after the '040 and  before the "RC").  This is the same
   334	mask as the C660av and Q840av  uses.  If you do the modification on them
   335	it would be best to add a  heat sink.
   336	
   337	How to put it all together:
   338	
   339	Stand the clip so it's jaws are facing down, and the rows of pins go 
   340	>From left to right, and call the closer row A and the further row B.  
   341	Number the pins from left to right 1 through 7 (for the 14 pin clip).  
   342	Next place the IC socket with the pins down, and the notch to the  left,
   343	and number the pins as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 in the row closest to  you,
   344	going left to right.  The other row is numbered 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,  13,
   345	14 as you go right to left (back towards the notch). Now starting with
   346	the test clip, leave pins in positions A2, A6, B2,  and B6.  Next solder
   347	a little jumper wire between pins A2 and A6.   Now get the 14 pin IC
   348	socket, and remove all the pins but 7, 8, and  14.  Solder a jumper wire
   349	from pin 7 on the IC socket to the  jumpered pins on the clip, either A2
   350	or A6.  Also solder a jumper  wire from pin 8 to pin B6, and pin 14 to
   351	pin B2. If you get the narrow clip, you may want to replace the spring
   352	with  one with less tension; they are like $0.30 at hardware stores, and
   353	I  cut them into two springs.  This way you don't have to push so hard, 
   354	and it is easier to position on the motherboard.  Now put the crystal 
   355	in the socket with pin 1 in 1, 2 in 2, 3 in 3 and 4 in 4. 
   356	There are several surface mount oscillators used on the  motherboards. 
   357	The proper surface mount crystal oscillator on the  mother board will
   358	have a frequency on it half that of your computer  and can be determined
   359	from the above list.
   360	
   361	That is it, now you just clamp it onto the surface mount crystal 
   362	oscillator with the notch on the socket facing the same way as the 
   363	surface mount crystal oscillator.  And watch to make sure the little 
   364	pins clamp onto the surface mount chip.  You may want to use a 
   365	flashlight for this.  These clips hang on very, very well, I've never 
   366	had mine move in the last 9 months, nor any of the other ones I've 
   367	done.
   368

   370	Centris 610 Ethernet Problems:
   371	
   372	Those Centris 610's that have ethernet capability share the 10MHz 
   373	oscillator with the CPU.  If you replace that oscillator with a 
   374	different one, your ethernet will no longer work.  In January, Eckart 
   375	Hasselbrink (Hasselbrink@fhi-berlin.mpg.de) posted a fairly simple 
   376	hardware modification to fix this to comp.sys.mac.hardware.  So if  you
   377	plan to use you ethernet on your Centris 650 and speed it up, you  will
   378	need to perform Eckart's modification first. 
   379	
   380	PowerMac's:
   381	
   382	I have only done PM6100's, and it works fine at 80MHz.  At 86MHz it 
   383	overheats quite rapidly.  With a cool hairdryer cooling the heatsink  on
   384	the 601, it worked fine, but was a bit noisy :-).  See the table to  see
   385	which oscillator you will need to clip onto.  This mod should  work just
   386	fine on the 7100 and 8100 computers as well.  On the  8100 the power
   387	supply may be in the way of the clip.  If anyone in  the Bay Area has a
   388	PM7100 or PM8100 and wants to try it, drop me a  line and we can give it
   389	a spin.  Or if anyone tries it, please let me  know how it goes so I can
   390	add it to this file and pass it on to others  who ask.  The guesses on
   391	the chart about what oscillator to use for  the PM7100 and PM8100 are
   392	just that, guesses.
   393	
   394	
   395	On most of these newer machines, the problem is with the serial  ports,
   396	but the speed of the memory is also important, so if you plan  to boost
   397	your Mac very far, you may need faster SIMM's. 
   398	To test out the modification, the best thing to do is just use it a 
   399	while.  You can run Speedometer 3.23 (available at SUMEX in info-
   400	mac/cfg) to see the changes.  I use Snooper with the serial port 
   401	loopback plugs to check the serial ports to find their limits; Snooper 
   402	also tells you what frequency you are running at in round numbers.  
   403	Snooper was made by Maxa, and I am told Snooper is currently owned  by
   404	Central Point Software.  The current version of MacCheck is 1.0.5 
   405	(available on bric-a-brac.apple.com), and it now properly reports the 
   406	computer frequency.
   407	
   408	If your Mac does not give the standard chime at startup it means  your
   409	clip is only half on.  It is disabling the surface mount  oscillator,
   410	but not replacing it.  Just remove the clip, reposition, and  try again.
   411	
   412	
   413	Special C650 Mod:
   414	
   415	Using the above clips, the max frequency for a Centris 650 is about 
   416	30MHz before you encounter serial port problems.  Marlin Prowell 
   417	(mbp@janus.com) following up on a hunch by James McPhail 
   418	(jmacphai@cue.bc.ca) looked into the differences between the C650  and
   419	Q800 motherboards in hopes that a simple modification might  enable the
   420	serial ports to function properly at 33MHz (Q800 normal  frequency) or
   421	higher.  On the bottom of the motherboard, under the  IOSB chip, Marlin
   422	found two differences.  R151 is installed on the  C650's, and is missing
   423	on the Q800's.  R152 is missing on the C650's,  and is installed on the
   424	Q800.  R151 is a 300 ohms resistor and R152  is a 1.2k ohm resistor. 
   425	Looking at the bottom of the board, with the  back away from you, R151
   426	is 3 3/4" from the right, and 3" down.  The  tabs for R152 are 4" from
   427	the right, and 3" down.  R151 is black, and  says 301 on it.
   428	Marlin felt that R151 was glued to the board, and just using solder 
   429	braid he was unable to remove the resistor for fear that prying it off 
   430	may damage the traces that run under it.  Heating the resistor with a 
   431	soldering iron Marlin was eventually able to soften the glue and  remove
   432	the resistor.  Or you can use James McPhail's two soldering  iron
   433	Western technique with a soldering iron in each hand to heat  each side
   434	simultaneously and flip the resistor off the board.  Now  just add the
   435	R152.  Marlin suggests holding the surface mount  resistor in place with
   436	a small screwdriver while soldering it to the  exposed pads on the
   437	board.
   438	Marlin has since used both the serial and modem ports error free  while
   439	running his C650 at 40MHz, and MacCheck reports no problems.   He has
   440	also checked to make sure the ethernet works, and it does.   Since
   441	Marlin's initial modification, it has been confirmed by at least  three
   442	people.  On some of these Mac's the CPU overheats after a  while, so
   443	Marlin suggests you add a fan to dissipate the heat faster  >From the
   444	heatsink.  You can also just run a bit slower, say 38MHz.   You can
   445	purchase these 1.2k resistors from Digi-Key, but the  minimum order is
   446	200 of them.  If you e-mail your address to Output  Enablers at
   447	oe@well.sf.ca.us, they will send you a free resistor left  over from
   448	Marlin's extra 199.
   449	****This modification makes your Mac think it has become a Quadra  650,
   450	and the Quadra 650 did not exist when most of you purchased  your
   451	Centris 650.  The System Enabler 040 that came with your  Centris 650,
   452	version 1.0, will not work after this modification, and  your Mac will
   453	not start up unless you have already updated the  System Enabler 040 to
   454	version 1.1, the current version.  The System  Enabler 040 version 1.1
   455	is available from your local Apple Dealer, or  you can ftp it from
   456	bric-a-brac.apple.com.  Marlin suggests you also  put the new enabler on
   457	all your recovery utility disks as well so you  will be prepared next
   458	time something goes wrong.**** 
   459	
   460	Recently a few companies have been started that replace the crystal 
   461	oscillator in powerbooks to speed them up, and add a 68882.  I have 
   462	some ideas on how to do this, and the precautions to make.  Has  anyone
   463	done it themselves?  I have some info from Virgil Mehalek 
   464	(vm@christa.unh.edu) who noted the differences between the 140 and  170. 
   465	I'm not going to add that info until it has been attempted, but  if
   466	anyone is interested in a copy of that info I can forward it to you.  
   467	One important addition thanks to Virgil, worth noting now is that 
   468	Active Electronics (800) 228-4836 sells the 33MHz MC68882-FN33A  for
   469	$76.95 plus S&H.
