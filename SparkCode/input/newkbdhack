     1		All right. I've noticed a number of people asking about putting
     2	an external keyboard on their 1200's. Unfortunately, the only replies
     3	they got said it couldn't be done, or that it would be very difficult. Neither
     4	of these is true. Electronically, the keyboard interface is pretty much the 
     5	same as it always has been. The only real obstacles are physical; Thus I 
     6	decided to make an attempt, and recently managed to pull it off. What follows 
     7	is an account of what I did along with a few suggestions. Be sure to read it
     8	through all the way before breaking out the tools...
     9	
    10		It's been working well so far (I'm typing this on my good old A1000 
    11	keyboard hooked up to my 1200 right now.) The result is that I can have 
    12	both an internal and external keyboard hooked up simultaneously without 
    13	interference. In fact, they complement one another. You can actually press 
    14	shift on one keyboard and 's' on the other and get a capital 'S'! Those old 
    15	6570 keyboard controllers are quite robust, seemingly in contrast to the on
    16	board one in the 1200. 
    17	
    18		Needless to say, doing this modification required some very delicate
    19	work. The internal keyboard micro has to be physically taken off-line
    20	in order to connect an external keyboard or keyboards. This isn't like the
    21	500 where all you had to do to hook up an external was to patch into
    22	the KCLK and KDAT lines, tap +5 and Ground from somewhere and you
    23	were done. The 6570's took care of all the handshaking automatically.
    24	Unfortunately, the 1200's keyboard micro doesn't work that way. Hooking 
    25	up another keyboard in parallel with it's clock + data lines just hangs both
    26	of them. (My guess is that the output isn't open-collector like it
    27	is on the externals, (there's no reason for it to be) so when you have
    28	an external hooked up, the internal can't drive its 0's low enough.)
    29	Anyway, I just decided to do away with the internal controller altogether.
    30	
    31		Um...let me just say this... I'm not really writing this post in the
    32	form of a full blown hardware hack. This is more of a "Here's what I did.
    33	If you'd like to give it a shot, here's what you need to know." sort
    34	of thing. I'm not going to go into disassembly instructions or anything 
    35	like that. I will make the standard disclaimer, though: If you try this and
    36	you blow up your machine, don't come crying to me. There are some quite
    37	tiny spots that have to be soldered and/or desoldered, so patience, a 
    38	steady hand, and a reasonably sharp soldering iron are a definite
    39	necessity. If there's enough support for turning this into a full article
    40	I'll throw something together. (My brother suggested submitting it to 
    41	AC, but it may be a bit hardcore for them. Schematically, it's quite
    42	simple, but the tiny joints do make it a little more difficult. Maybe 
    43	Aminet...
    44	
    45		Okay, with that out of the way here are the gooey details. The two
    46	chips we'll be dealing with are U13 (The keyboard micro) and U7 (The
    47	keyboard/parallel 8520). Try to keep your soldering iron and any other
    48	potentially destructive tools away from the other chips. ;^) The KBClk and 
    49	KBDat pins on the keyboard micro need to be heated and bent up away 
    50	from the motherboard. I touched the top of the pin with the iron, let it heat 
    51	for a second and then, with a razor-knife wedged behind the pin, twisted, 
    52	lifting the pin away from the board. There's not much solder holding these 
    53	down, so it shouldn't take too much force. Once the pin was free, I straight
    54	ened it up with a pair of needle-nose pliers and went on to the next one. 
    55	Fortunately, both pins are right next to each other and the keyboard micro 
    56	(and the 8520) are surface-mounted PLCC's and not true SMD's. These 
    57	are the only two pins that need to be desoldered. The rest of this hack just 
    58	involves soldering wires in. 
    59	***NOTE: I've heard from at least two people that their internal micros did not
    60	need to be taken offline for the external to work. All I know is that on mine 
    61	it had to be disconnected. Your Mileage May Vary, however, so you may 
    62	want to try skipping this step, do the rest, and see if it works.***
    63	
    64		Get your hands on the smallest insulated wire you can find (>24 awg),
    65	and solder wires to the KBClk, KBDat and _KBReset lines as shown in the diagram
    66	below. The number of pins on the chips should be accurate. they are 44 pin 
    67	PLCC's, with 11 pins on each side. The ^ denotes the pin 1 dot on the chips.

   105	
   106		As you can see, power is easily tapped from the floppy cable. You 
   107	should use somewhat larger wires for this. Thus, when you're done you 
   108	should have five wires coming out of your machine: KBClk, KBDat, 
   109	_KBReset, +5, and Gnd. You will also have a non-functional internal key
   110	board. If you want, however, you can take these wires (except _KBReset) 
   111	and hook them up to a 5 pin DIN and attach a 2000/3000 keyboard, or a 
   112	phone plug and connect a 1000 keyboard. There is a catch, however. You 
   113	will not be able to reset from the external keyboard. 1000s, 2000s, 3000s, 
   114	and 4000s have internal circuitry which interprets 500 milliseconds of 
   115	KBClk low as a "reset" pulse, and pulls the _KBReset line internally (This is 
   116	according to the Hardware Manual). So unless you fabricate a circuit that 
   117	does this (see below), you'll need to reset from the native keyboard. (This 
   118	function should still work. Actually, If you're going to do it this way, 
   119	there's no need to solder the extra wire for _KBReset.) 
   120	
   121		Now, the A500 keyboard is slightly different. It has no case but it
   122	will generate a _KBReset signal. Remember how I said you could have two
   123	kbd's simultaneously? Well, all you have to do is hook up your external as
   124	described above, and string your wires along (Including _KBReset) to the 
   125	500 keyboard. What's more, the 500 keyboard is a near-exact fit replace
   126	ment for the 1200 one (and with full sized Left-Shift and Return keys!). In 
   127	order to do this I had to desolder the LEDs on the 500 kbd altogether and 
   128	then remove the ones from the 1200's "LED board", hot glue them individually
   129	to their positions, bend the leads down flat, and wire them up again. Also, 
   130	the support on the top part of the wedge-shaped floppy bracket has to be sawed
   131	off to make room for the encoder board. It works, though, and theoretically I
   132	should even be able to fit the RF shield back on.
   133	
   134		Okay, so you may not like the beige-colored keys of the 500 keyboard
   135	sticking out of your shiny white 1200 case. The simple solution is to swap 
   136	the 500 keyboard's beige keycaps for your defunct 1200 keyboard's white ones.
   137	They should be the same in every respect except color. There is, however,
   138	another alternative. Your original 1200 keyboard may be compatible with the 500 
   139	keyboard's encoder board. Encoder boards that are compatible have a
   140	slot for one large ribbon cable to fit in.  Incompatible encoder boards have 
   141	slots for two small ribbon cables. If compatible, all you have to do is unplug 
   142	the ribbon from the 500 keyboard itself, unscrew the little circuit board in 
   143	the upper-right corner (the encoder board) and remove it along with its 
   144	plastic bottom-shield. You can then plug the ribbon from your 1200 kbd into 
   145	the socket, and wire the encoder board up as you would with the
   146	true 500 keyboard. This is the setup I had originally. Now, since the ribbon 
   147	comes out of the middle-back of the 1200 keyboard, you have to put the 
   148	controller board in that same vicinity. It's up to you how to mount it, but 
   149	what I did was to first off trash the RF shield. (REAL hackers don' need no 
   150	steenkin' RF shield 8^) ) Then I hot-glued the plastic shield to the bottom of 
   151	the encoder board, and hot-glued this by the lower left corner to the top of 
   152	the hard drive. The other end rests on the floppy cable, and tension from 
   153	the keyboard ribbon folded under the keyboard keeps the whole thing 
   154	steady.
   155	
   156	Here's a quick recap:
   157	
   158	       -Desolder the clock and data pins coming from the onboard A1200 
   159		keyboard microcontroller. (This is probably the hardest part of this
   160		whole thing.)
   161	
   162	       -Solder the KBClk, KBDat, _KBReset, +5, and Gnd. lines to the 
   163		locations described in the diagram. (A magnifier lamp is useful for 
   164		this.)
   165	
   166	       -Hook the KBDat, KBClk, +5, and Gnd. lines up to some sort of 
   167		external keyboard connector, and use the dead internal to reset, OR
   168	
   169		Hook the KBDat, KBClk, +5, and Gnd. lines up to some sort of 
   170		external keyboard connector and run the wires along to their 
   171		corresponding locations on a 500 keyboard INCLUDING _KBReset, OR
   172	
   173		Hook the KBDat, KBClk, +5, and Gnd. lines up to some sort of 
   174		external keyboard connector and run the wires along to their 
   175		corresponding locations on a 500 keyboard's encoder board INCLUDING 
   176		_KBReset and then plug your 1200 keyboard's ribbon cable into the
   177		encoder board.
   178	
   179	       -Seal up, fasten down, make sure there are no solder bridges, shorts,
   180		etc.
   181	
   182	       -Power up and enjoy!

   224	That's pretty much it. As I said, this isn't a full tutorial, so I'm
   225	leaving the mechanical considerations up to the reader.

   227	free to add them in yourself. Start a credits list if you so desire.
   228	
   229	Some final thoughts:
   230	
   231		-I wouldn't worry too much about power supply overloading. I've
   232		 got 2 floppys, 2 keyboards, a hard drive, a DataFlyer SCSI+ 
   233		 SCSI controller, and a MicroBotics 50Mhz 1230XA with '881 and 8
   234		 megs and my stock supply hasn't complained yet.
   235	
   236		-You could also use a DPDT switch to switch between internal and
   237		 external keyboards. One side goes to KBClk and KBDat on the internal
   238		 micro, the other side goes to the same lines from the external, and
   239		 the middle goes to the pins on the 8520. The keyboards should be
   240		 able to deal with being switched in or out in midstream.
   241		 (I have not actually tried this one, but don't see why it wouldn't
   242		 work, as it's effectively the same thing as unplugging one keyboard
   243		 and plugging in another one.) The Hardware Manual says the keyboards
   244		 were designed to handle hot connects/disconnects.
   245	
   246		-No, IBM keyboards are electrically totally different. You would
   247		 need a microprocessor driven interface to make the translation.
   248		 There is a (fairly involved) hack on Aminet in /hard/hack to do this.
   249	
   250		-If you hook everything up and get a pulsing stream of '''s, you've
   251		 got the clock and data lines backwards. Switch them around.
   252	
   253		-If you're installing your 1200 in a tower and your tower has a 
   254		 Reset button on it, you can hook the _KBReset line and Ground up
   255		 to the button and reset that way.
   256	
   257		-As a couple people have asked, I don't have A1200 schematics. The
   258		 data herein is the result of some poking around with a logic probe,
   259		 a little deductive reasoning, some extrapolation from the A500
   260		 schematics, and a lot of trial and error. However, if someone out
   261		 there HAS A1200 schematics, I'll gladly reimburse you for your time
   262		 at a photocopier! 8^)

   268	The following is an optional modification to the above hack which allows
   269	the ability to reset the computer from the external keyboard, posted by
   270	Dana Peters. It looks good, although as of this time I have not yet tried
   271	it myself.

   277	-----
   278	
   279	Got an A1200?  What do you think of the keyboard?  If you're a touch
   280	typist you probably figured out pretty fast that the A1200 keyboard
   281	has a problem with rollover. Try rolling over between two keys on the
   282	same row, and you're just as likely to get them in the reverse order
   283	as the forward order.  Commodore botched this one, IMHO.
   284	
   285	Anyway, I decided to try to "fix" my machine, and found two different
   286	hacks to put another model Amiga keyboard on the A1200; one by Hans
   287	Luijten (j.a.w.m.luijten@kub.nl) and another by Sean Curtin
   288	(squirrel@cup.portal.com).  Using the info from these plans I decided
   289	to add a connector to my A1200 for an A2000/3000 keyboard. Although
   290	the plans called for two pins to be cut or desoldered to disable the
   291	internal keyboard, on my machine I tried leaving the connections
   292	intact, and found that both the internal and external keyboards were
   293	able to co-exist without problems.  Your mileage may vary, however.
   294	
   295	The other change I made to the plans was to create a circuit to allow
   296	the external keyboard to reset the A1200 the way god intended... with
   297	the three finger salute.  This avoids having to use the internal
   298	keyboard to reset or having to wire up a separate button to perform
   299	reset.  What follows is a uuencoded .lha file containing an IFF
   300	picture of the external keyboard reset circuit and some additional
