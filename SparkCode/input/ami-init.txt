     1	                      Amiga 'Boot' Sequence
     2	
     3	  After getting a number of inquiries from fellow Amiga users about what's
     4	  wrong with their Amigas when their Caplock key starts flashing, or, why
     5	  the screen flashed odd colors, I decided to create this file.
     6	
     7	  The Amiga goes through a rather elaborate startup sequence which is a
     8	  series of diagnostic tests the Amiga goes through during each 'cold' or
     9	  'warm' boot. The following is a list of what happens during each and
    10	  every 'boot':
    11	
    12	  1. Clear all old data in RAM
    13	  2. Disable DMA and interrupts
    14	  3. Clear the screen
    15	  4. Check hardware (is the 680x0 working?)
    16	  5. Change screen color indicating pass/fail
    17	  6. Perform checksum test of all ROMs
    18	  7. Change screen color indicating pass/fail
    19	  8. Begin system startup
    20	  9. Check RAM at $C0000..move SYSBASE there
    21	 10. Test CHIP RAM
    22	 11. Change screen color indicating pass/fail
    23	 12. Check if software is coming in OK
    24	 13. Change screen color indicating pass/fail
    25	 14. Set up CHIP RAM to receive data
    26	 15. Link libraries
    27	 16. Check for any additional RAM and link it
    28	 17. Turn on DMA and interrupts
    29	 18. Start default task
    30	 19. Check processor and MMU type
    31	 20. Check for an Exception (processor error)
    32	 21. If found, do a reset
    33	 22. If not, normal 'boot'
    34	
    35	As these tests are running, the Capslock key will normally 'flash' once,
    36	and the screen will cycle colors. The chart below used in conjunction
    37	with the above steps indicates both a 'normal' and an 'abnormal' boot.
    38	
    39	NORMAL                                 Fault Condition
    40	
    41	Sreen color:
    42	   Dark Grey                           Red (indicates error in ROM)
    43	   Light Grey                          Green (error in CHIP RAM)
    44	   White                               Blue (error in a Custom Chip)
    45	                                       Yellow (680x0 found an error)
    46	
    47	Capslock Key:
    48	  Stays on for several secs            One blink (ROM checksum failed)
    49	                                       Two blinks (RAM test failed)
    50	                                       Three blinks (Whatchdog timer)
    51	                                       Four blinks (A short exists between
    52	                                                    2 lines or one of the
    53	                                                    special keys)
    54	
    55	
    56	Please note that the capslock 'blinks' are short in duration (about one
    57	second) and that your screen colors may falsely indicate a problem when
    58	you do a 'warm' boot depending on what state the Amiga was in before the
    59	warm boot. Its best to watch for these diagostic errors upon initial
    60	startup. If your Amiga exhibits any of these errors frequently, you should
    61	take it to an Authorised Service Center for service. The most common
    62	error you will encounter is that you'll see a bright green screen at the
    63	initial boot..this usually indicates that an addon RAM board is not
    64	seated in its socket properly. Try reseating it before you take it all to
    65	your dealer. You may save yourself some money;)
