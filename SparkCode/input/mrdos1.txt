     1	IF YOU HAVE NEVER USED A COMPUTER BEFORE:
     2	
     3	Welcome!  Computers have been around since the Chinese Abacus.
     4	They are here to stay.  There is a certain feel and flow to the
     5	logic which directs their activities.
     6	
     7	Electronically all computers work about the same.  The one you
     8	are using is called a MICROcomputer.  This is due to its size.
     9	Larger computers include MINIcomputers and Mainframe computers.
    10	
    11	RAM
    12	---
    13	Think of a computer as a human brain.  Your brain is a memory sponge.
    14	It contains a lifetime of memories which cause us to act or react
    15	based on inputs.  Inputs come via our 5 senses.  If you see and smell
    16	a steak burning on the grill (inputs) you know how to react based on
    17	previous experiences (memory - go out to eat).
    18	
    19	The computer's brain is comprised of a large memory area called Random
    20	Access Memory (RAM) and a calculating portion called the Central Processing
    21	Unit (CPU).  The CPU and RAM work together as the computer's "brain".  Each
    22	day when we start up the computer one of the first tasks will be to fill
    23	RAM with instructions to give it an ability to perform work.  This work may
    24	be in the creation of documents or tracking accounting data (more information
    25	on CPU is found under the HARDWARE section).
    26	
    27	You control which instructions will go into the computer's brain.
    28	You control which sets of experiences you will provide the
    29	computer.  Once in RAM, the computer will evaluate inputs from
    30	many devices and react.  The most typical input device is a
    31	keyboard.  As you type commands, the computer evaluates them and
    32	based on the set of instructions within its RAM, will follow some
    33	action - perhaps print a document, calculate, or send information
    34	over a telephone line.
    35	
    36	At some later point you may empty the computer's brain and
    37	install a different set of instructions, thus giving it a
    38	different ability.
    39	
    40	Unlike a human, the computer requires electricity to keep the
    41	information within RAM.  Each time the computer is turned off,
    42	all information within RAM is lost.  RAM is a temporary memory.
    43	To save instructions for use at a later date, a storage device is
    44	required.  Computers use many such devices.  Your computer uses a
    45	Floppy Disk and/or a Hard Disk.  Both are similar.
    46	
    47	DISKS
    48	-----
    49	Think of these disks as cassettes.  You can record information on
    50	a cassette which can be replayed indefinitely and if desired,
    51	recorded over.  Floppy and Hard Disks operate in a similar fashion.
    52	We record (Save) something we have created - like a document - onto the
    53	disk.  Then, hours, days, or months later we are able to play back
    54	(Retrieve) the document into the computer to alter or print out.  Just
    55	like cassettes, the Floppy and Hard Disks do not require electricity to         
    56	
    57	
    58	
    59	
    60	
    61	retain their information.
    62	
    63	Hard Disks and Floppy Disks are similar.  Hard Drives have a larger
    64	capacity for file storage, are faster and are less likely to fail due
    65	to the protected environment from within which they operate.
    66	
    67	RAM is called volatile memory because of the electricity
    68	requirement.  Floppy and Hard Disks are called non-volatile
    69	memory because they will retain their information without the aid
    70	of electricity.
    71	
    72	A computer system includes computer hardware, software and
    73	people.  A computer is a device capable of solving problems
    74	or manipulating data by accepting data, performing prescribed
    75	operations on the data, and displaying the results.
    76	
    77	HARDWARE versus SOFTWARE
    78	------------------------
    79	HARDWARE:  Physical equipment such as electronic,
    80	magnetic, and mechanical devices (monitor, keyboard,
    81	printer, microchip boards,...).  Includes INPUT/OUTPUT
    82	DEVICES which allow the operator to communicate with the
    83	computer and vice versa.
    84	
    85	SOFTWARE:  Sets of programs (stored sets of
    86	instructions) that govern the operation of computer system
    87	and make the hardware run.  These programs (instructions)
    88	tell the hardware how to perform a particular task such as
    89	word processing, games, database management, etc.
    90	
    91	Software refers to the instructions that are used to enable
    92	an otherwise dead machine to understand your inputs and
    93	transform them into desired outputs.
    94	
    95	Computer hardware by itself has no personality; this is
    96	determined by the software.  Word processing software turns
    97	the computer into a word processor, accounting software turns
    98	the computer into an accounting tool, etc.
    99	
   100	The computer requires two types of Software:
   101	
   102	  DOS - Disk Operating System
   103	  Application Software - Word Processing, Spreadsheet, Games,
   104	                         Database Management, Accounting, Payroll, etc.
   105	
   106	DOS (Disk Operating System)
   107	---
   108	All computers require an operating system and the one IBM
   109	PC's use is referred to as DOS (sounds like floss).  DOS is
   110	software that allows the terminal, printer, computer and mass
   111	storage systems (floppy disks) to work together as a unit,
   112	and controls the execution of programs.  It also allows you
   113	to perform housekeeping chores in regards to managing disks
   114	and files.                                                                      
   115	
   116	
   117	
   118	
   119	
   120	
   121	
   122	Therefore - DOS: 1. Links Hardware
   123	                 2. Enables File Management
   124	
   125	
   126	PROPER HANDLING OF DISKS  -  DISKS NEED CARE!
   127	------------------------
   128	 - Never touch the mylar surface  - Do not bend the disks
   129	 - Always store in their protective sleeve
   130	 - Hold the disk by its label or any part of the sleeve
   131	 - Avoid bringing disks near magnets (TVs, telephones,..)
   132	 - Do not leave in hot or cold areas (radiators, car-dash, in
   133	   car during winter, etc.)
   134	 - Use felt tip pens if possible when labeling.  Ball points
   135	   can crease the mylar.
   136	
   137	Note the write-protect notch on the disk.  If this is covered
   138	by tape or non-existent, data cannot be "written" to the disk.
   139	However, data can still be "read" from the disk.
   140	
   141	It is a good idea to always save data and programs on two
   142	separate disks in case one is destroyed.  Even with the most
   143	cautious of care, the delicate Floppy Disks sometimes fail
   144	for no apparent reason.
   145	
   146	
   147	HISTORY:
   148	
   149	The first computational device was the abacus.  This has been
   150	in continuous use for thousands of years.  During the 1600's the
   151	Pascal adding machine was developed.  This was a mechanical
   152	device which laid the groundwork for today's odometers and
   153	gas meters.  The 1800's saw many machines developed that were
   154	controlled by punch cards - weaving looms, etc.  The
   155	theoretical basis for electronic circuitry was developed in
   156	the mid 1800's.
   157	
   158	The first electronic computer was developed in 1942 at Iowa
   159	State College.  From this point forth there were numerous
   160	firsts as computers became less mechanical, smaller, faster
   161	and cheaper.  IBM began dominating the computer market by the
   162	mid-1950's and still does today in the mainframe (very large
   163	computer installation) market.  Digital Equipment Corp.
   164	(DEC) became a significant competitor by the mid-1960's.  DEC
   165	is generally considered technically better (faster, smaller,
   166	etc.) than IBM but still only has a fraction of the total
   167	market due to marketing snafus.  Today the Cray Supercomputer
   168	is the fastest in the world, is manufactured in Wisconsin,
   169	and is set in a vat of liquid helium to increase the
   170	conductivity for faster operation.
   171

   177	                     TIME vs SPEED
   178	
   179	Method of Calculation             Approximate Speed
   180	Human (manual calculation)        1 each 60 seconds
   181	Burroughs E101 (1954)             4 per second
   182	IBM 1130 (1964)                   600,000 per second
   183	DEC PDP 11 (1974)                 1,000,000 per second
   184	Cray supercomputer                13,000,000 per second
   185	
   186	The Personal Computer is defined by its size, cost
   187	applications for small business and the home.   The first one
   188	appeared in January 1975 and was the Altair 8800 kit.  Only
   189	hobbyist bought these.  Then the Radio Shack TRS 80 and Apple
   190	computers hit the market as the first pre-assembled
   191	microcomputers.
   192	
   193	Market growth remained sluggish until two business students -
   194	Dan Bricklin and Dan Fylstra developed a program to run on
   195	Apple computers to handle the tedious recalculations in their
   196	school assignments.  This program was called VisiCalc and is
   197	the forerunner to the spreadsheet program Lotus 123.
   198	
   199	With VisiCalc as a useful tool, Apple sales took off.  Apple
   200	became the standard because all programs were written for
   201	Apple.  Today we still see Apple dominate the school market.
   202	
   203	In 1981 IBM introduced its PC which is unable to run Apple
   204	software.  Unlike Apple or other IBM products, the IBM PC had
   205	an open architecture which means the technical details of how
   206	it operated were published right along with the product's
   207	introduction.  This permitted hundreds of companies to write
   208	software (programs) for the IBM PC as well as a variety of
   209	accessories.  Adding IBM's sterling reputation, the open
   210	architecture did enable rapid market penetration.  The
   211	microcomputer was no longer a toy, it was a business tool.
   212	
   213	The open architecture however, also allowed for the
   214	generation of a host of lower cost compatible computers.
   215	IBM had traded quick initial market entry for eventual erosion
   216	of market share.  In both instances, we the consumers
   217	benefit.
