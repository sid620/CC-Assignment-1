    11	                ALTERING THE IBM PCJR 128 MEMORY MODULE
    12	
    13	                              TO 512K
    14	
    15	
    16	
    17	              The following instructions will show you how to alter
    18	         your IBM PCJR side mounted 128k memory module to 512k. this
    19	         of course will give a potent 640k machine providing you have
    20	         the later release of the 128k and not the 64k original.
    21	
    22	              You must be able to use a soldering iron and be able to
    23	         de-solder connections. I am not an expert with a soldering
    24	         iron but I found just being careful and taking my time I was
    25	         able to complete the operation in about four hours without
    26	         damaging my board or components as I have heard others have
    27	         done.
    28	
    29	              An important factor in my wanting to make this
    30	         alteration was the obvious cost. total parts cost for me was
    31	More? 
    32	         approx. $70.00. I understand that the parts may be purchased
    33	         cheaper elsewhere so you may want to shop around. If you have
    34	         been hungry for more memory in your JR and saw the prices for
    35	         commercial memory expansions you can see that you will save
    36	         up to $400.00 by doing this operation.
    37	
    38	
    39	
    40	                                  STEPS
    41	
    42	
    43	         1. REMOVE THE 128K MEMORY BOARD FROM THE MODULE. HOLD THE
    44	         COMPONENT SIDE TOWARDS YOU AND LOOK FOR 16 CHIPS MOUNTED IN A
    45	         ROW VERTICALLY ALONG ONE OF THE LONG EDGES OF THE BOARD.
    46	         THESE CHIPS WILL ALSO HAVE THE SAME NUMBER ON THEM. THESE ARE
    47	         THE 16 CHIPS YOU WILL REMOVE.
    48	
    49	         2. CAREFULLY UNSOLDER AND REMOVE THESE CHIPS. BE VERY CAREFUL
    50	         NOT TO ALLOW SOLDER TO GET ON OTHER COMPONENTS, IF IT DOES,
    51	         REMOVE IT. ALSO BE CAREFUL ABOUT SCRATCHING THE BOARD AS YOU
    52	         MAY DISCONNECT A PRINTED CIRCUT FROM A COMPONENT.
    53	
    54	         3. NOW BEFORE YOU REPLACE THE CHIPS YOU JUST REMOVED I HIGHLY
    55	         RECOMMEND YOU INSTALL 16 PIN SOCKETS WHERE YOU JUST REMOVED
    56	         EACH CHIP FROM. THESE SOCKETS ARE VERY INEXPENSIVE AND WILL
    57	         ALLOW YOU TO PLACE THE NEW LARGER CAPACITY CHIPS ON THE BOARD
    58	         WITHOUT EXPOSING THEM TO THE HEAT OF THE SOLDERING IRON.
    59	
    60	         4. BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER YOU HAVE TO ALTER A JUMPER ON THE
    61	More? 
    62	         BOARD SO IT WILL OPERATE WITH THE NEW 256K CHIPS. LOOK IN THE
    63	         APPROXIMATE CENTER OF THE CIRCUT BOARD FOR A SMALL RECTANGLE
    64	         OUTLINED WITH WHITE PAINT. IN THE CENTER OF IT ARE THREE
    65	         SOLDER POINTS.
    66	
    67	
    68	
    69	
    70	
    71	
    72	
    73	
    74	
    75	                        EXAMPLE
    76	
    77	
    78	                          _______________
    79	                         |               |
    80	                         |  O----O    O  |
    81	                         |_______________|
    82	
    83	
    84	
    85	         5. YOU WILL NOTICE THAT THE TWO LEFT HOLES ARE CONNECTED BY A
    86	         JUMPER. THIS SETUP IS SELECTING THE BOARD FOR 64K CHIPS.
    87	         BECAUSE YOU ARE INSTALLING 256K CHIPS YOU HAVE TO JUMP THE
    88	         TWO RIGHT MOST HOLES. CUT THE WIRE LEADING TO THE TWO LEFT
    89	         MOST HOLES AND INSTALL A JUMPER ON THE TWO RIGHT HOLES
    90	         (SOLDER).
    91	More? 
    92	
    93	         6.PLUG IN YOUR NEW LARGER (MEMORY) CHIPS INTO THE SOCKETS YOU
    94	         HAVE PREVIOUSLY INSTALLED. THE RECOMMENDED CHIPS ARE:
    95	                   256Kx1 DRAMS 150ns
    96	         USE CAUTION WHEN PLUGGING IN YOUR NEW CHIPS SO AS NOT TO BEND
    97	         ANY PINS. I ACCIDENTALLY DID THIS WITH JUST ONE PIN FROM ONE
    98	         CHIP AND THE BOARD FAILED TO FUNCTION. BY RECHECKING MY WORK
    99	         I SAW THAT A LEAD FROM A CHIP BENT UNDERNEATH THE CHIP AND
   100	         FAILED TO GO INTO THE PLUG SOCKET.
   101	
   102	         7. NOW GO TO THE ADDRESS SWITCHES TO THE END OF THE CIRCUT
   103	         BOARD. THIS IS THE SMALL BOX WITH FOUR SMALL SWITCHES THAT IS
   104	         VISIBLE TO THE REAR OF THE MODULE. TURN ALL OF THESE SWITCHES
   105	         ON. THIS ALLOW YOUR BOARD TO ANSWER UP AS 512K. REPLACE THE
   106	         CIRCUT BOARD INTO THE MODULE AND PLUG IT IN.
