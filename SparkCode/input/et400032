     7	Tseng Labs Inc. (PA. USA) has started sampling it's ET4000/W32 Multi-
     8	processing, Multi-tasking SVGA chips. At the Microsoft Window Hardware
     9	conference Sept 1 '92, the ET4000/W32 showed a Winmark of 28 million
    10	pixels/sec - over 60% faster than any other DRAM or VRAM Windows
    11	accelerator cards shown at the conference. The figure will be further
    12	improved with newer software drivers.
    13	
    14	Windows' performance is not TSENG ET4000/W32's only strength, it offers
    15	other important advantages :
    16	
    17	* Compatibility
    18	
    19	        The ET4000/W32 is hardware and software compatible with
    20	        approximately 5,000,000 ET4000 installations. This
    21	        compatibility protects users' old investments on software/
    22	        hardware and offers a very powerful growth path.
    23	
    24	* 16-bit/32-bit bus with Video Cache
    25	
    26	        ET4000 has been widely recognized for its excellent Local Bus
    27	        performance due to its video cache technology. The ET4000/W32
    28	        has a 2nd generation video cache technology which offers better
    29	        performance and an architecture for future products such as the
    30	        ET4000/W64.
    31	
    32	* Windows acceleration
    33	
    34	        ET4000 is designed for improvement of Windows performance and
    35	        multimedia applications instead of cloning IBM 8514/A or XGA.
    36	        It out-performs and out functions 8514/A and XGA.
    37	
    38	* Imaging Port and hardware Window
    39	
    40	        The ET4000/W32 offers an Imaging Port to accept imaging data
    41	        and can display the image on a hardware window. Hardware Zoom
    42	        and Video functions will be available on early 1993 with a
    43	        small ASIC chip complimentary to ET4000/W32.
    44	
    45	* Simultaneous multi-processing
    46	
    47	        The ET4000/W32's Windows accelerator, CRTC and Imaging Port
    48	        can operate simultaneously. Most other Windows accelerators
    49	        can only do one task at the time (Example : When CPU writes
    50	        to display memory, Windows accelerator has to stop or vice
    51	        versa).
    52	
    53	        It's multi-processing capability will be able to take
    54	        advantage of multi-thread capability of new operating systems
    55	        such as Windows NT.
    56	
    57	* High color and True color
    58	
    59	        ET4000/W32 supports 800x600 in 24-bit true color, and 1280x1024
    60	        in 16-bit color.
    61	
    62	* Low-cost DRAM
    63	
    64	        The ET4000/W32 requires only 80ns ot 70ns DRAM to provide high
    65	        performance and multi-processing capability.
    66	
    67	
    68	Tseng is now delivering 1st-iteration chips which contains some minor
    69	bugs. "We fully acknowledge and document these bugs. We know the errors
    70	and their solutions. The 2nd iteration will be available to customers
    71	at early Oct. 92 and will correct all those bugs. For such a powerful
    72	and sophisticated chip the achievement of 1st iteration chips of
    73	ET4000/W32 proves Tseng's technological excellence" said Jack Huang,
    74	President of TsengLabs International Co., Ltd. at Taipei.
    75	
    76	With about 5 million ET4000 chips installations and the new ET4000/W32
    77	chip, Tseng positions to continue to set standard and paces of PC
    78	graphics display technology.
