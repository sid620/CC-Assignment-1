     2	                   TIPS AND TRICKS FROM T&J SOFTWARE

     5	WILDCAT! 4.x
     6	============
     7	* Problems may develop using the DOOR.SYS drop file if you have
     8	  a LARGE number of conferences. I would suggest picking up a copy
     9	  of a file called FDOORSYS.ZIP written by Tim Rider (Tim can be
    10	  reached on The Source BBS at 310-371-3737). Here is what Tim's
    11	  documentation states:
    12	
    13	  "WildCat! v4.0 allows up to 32,000 conference areas.  Due to the
    14	   specifications of DOOR.SYS, all the conferences that a user is
    15	   joined to are written to line #23 of DOOR.SYS.  32,000 conferences
    16	   takes up a lot of room, and some SysOps have a DOOR.SYS file that may
    17	   end up to be over 100k.  Some doors have been choking on the large
    18	   DOOR.SYS, so I wrote this small utility to remove that line."
    19	
    20	   from FDOORSYS.DOC by Tim Rider
    21	
    22	RENEGADE BBS
    23	============
    24	* If you are using BNU fossil driver and having problems with the
    25	  doors, try using X00 v1.50+. Several Renegade systems have reported
    26	  problems using BNU with the doors.
    27	
    28	* If you are getting out of memory errors. Go into the System Config
    29	  section, [E] System Toggles, then [U] to turn the SWAP FILE 'ON'.
    30	
    31	TRIBBS v5.02+
    32	=============
    33	* Color ANSI checking will not work if you use TRIBBS.SYS drop file.
    34	  Set the doors up using the PCBOARD.SYS drop file.
    35	
    36	* If you use DOOR.SYS, TriBBS reloads this file and will deduct twice
    37	  the amount of time that was actually used. Try using another drop
    38	  file, or copying the DOOR.SYS to a seperate directory and then
    39	  telling the door to look there for it.
    40	
    41	* NOTE: This only applies to doors that you adjust the users time in
    42	        the door such as Bordello, Studs, and Studette.
    43	
    44	T&J Raffle
    45	==========
    46	* An ILLEGAL FUNCTION CALL will result if you enter a "closing
    47	  date" that is not valid. If you want the door to lock at the
    48	  end of the month, then put in the first of the month.
    49	
    50	Remote Access v2.0
    51	==================
    52	* Using DOOR.SYS may result in an OVERFLOW error -- try using a
    53	  different caller drop file such as DORINFO1.DEF. This is currently
    54	  being examined!
    55	
    56	Keyboard Timeouts
    57	=================
    58	* If you are operating on a 486 computer and getting a "keyboard
    59	  timeout", you will need to set the following environmental variable
    60	  in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.
    61	
    62	  SET NO87=ON
    63	
    64	  This will turn off your co-processor and allow the door to function
    65	  properly
    66	
    67	Overflow Errors
    68	===============
    69	* Overflows can occur if you are running under DESQview and your tick
    70	  counts are set too low -- try raising the tick counts.
    71	
    72	* If you're running Wildcat! v3.9+ and are getting OVERFLOW errors,
    73	  make sure NONE of your security level definitions have the MAXIMUM
    74	  DAILY DOWNLOADS set to more than 32,000 -- anything over that will
    75	  cause an OVERFLOW ERROR in ANY door using DOORFRAME.
    76	
    77	Garbled Information on Remote
    78	=============================
    79	* If the door seems to operate fine on the BBS end but the remote
    80	  cannot receive or receives garbled information, check and make sure
    81	  you are passing the correct IRQ to the door (if you are running a
    82	  non standard IRQ).
    83	
    84	Graphic Cards (general)
    85	=======================
    86	* ATI Graphics Ultra Pro card - do not use the ANSI.SYS driver that
    87	  came with the card. Use the normal DOS ANSI.SYS for the screens
    88	  to show correctly.
    89	
    90	* Trident SVGA Cards - You should have a utility disk with a file
    91	  called TANSI.SYS, use this ansi driver instead of the standard
    92	  ANSI.SYS.
    93	
    94	DESQview/X
    95	==========
    96	* Make sure you have the MATH COPROCESSOR flagged ON even if you don't
    97	  have a math coprocessor.
    98	
    99	Lockups on certain COM PORTS
   100	============================
   101	* If you're running on a non-standard IRQ, be sure you are passing the
   102	  IRQ on the command line!! Example:  STUDS! STUDS!.CFG /5
   103	
   104	  Studs! will now run on IRQ 5.
   105	
   106	Upgrading to New Versions
   107	=========================
   108	* When you purchase a KEY from T&J Software, that KEY is valid for
   109	  all upgrades also!
   110	
   111	Wildcat! 3.x
   112	============
   113	* If you are running Studs!, Studette!, or Bordello!, you must use the
   114	  caller drop file DOOR.SYS to make sure the callers remaining time is
   115	  passed back to Wildcat!
   116	
   117	* Wildcat! IM Version Setup using DigiFossil v1.3:
   118	
   119	  All of our doors will run on the Wildcat! IM version using DigiFos
   120	  v1.3. I have received TWO different setup routines concerning the
   121	  IM version, here's an example:
   122	
   123	  DF LOCK%WCNODEID%            -OR-      DF ON
   124	  CD\WC30\DOOR\STUDS                     CD\WC30\DOOR\STUDS
   125	  STUDS! STUDS!.CFG /FD                  STUDS! STUDS!.CFG
   126	  CD\WC30                                CD\WC30
   127	  DF OFF                                 DF OFF
   128	
   129	  Comments on either setup would be greatly appreciated!
   130	
   131	Spitfire BBS's
   132	==============
   133	* If you're having trouble with the doors dropping carrier on exiting
   134	  back to the BBS, switch to using DOOR.SYS instead of SFDOORS.DAT.
   135	  On some Spitfire configurations this will happen when using
   136	  SFDOORS.DAT.
   137	
   138	Using DESQview
   139	==============
   140	* If you're running the doors under DV and you're getting ANSI
   141	  character codes on the local monitor, be sure to load the file
   142	  DVANSI.COM in the main batch file that starts your BBS!
   143	
   144	Bulletin PATHS and FILENAMES
   145	============================
   146	* When specifying the bulletin path, be sure to also select a name
   147	  for the bulletin! This could cause lockups when using Bordello,
   148	  Strip Poker, and Video Poker. If you don't want bulletins created,
   149	  simply enter the word NONE for the path and filename.
   150	
   151	REGISTERED KEYS
   152	===============
   153	* Distribution of a registered key is against copyright laws, which
   154	  carries significant penalties. If a registered key is found being
   155	  distributed, all keys purchased from us (by the person distributing
   156	  the keys) will be invalidated and the matter will be turned over to
   157	  our attorney's. We do share this information with other shareware
   158	  authors.
   159	
   160	ERROR Codes (general)
   161	=====================
   162	* ERROR #53 - This error means a file was not found. If this occurs
   163	  right when the door is opened, please check the PATH to the caller
   164	  drop file (i.e. DOOR.SYS), or make sure the caller drop file is
   165	  being created properly!
   166	
   167	                            QuickBasic Error codes
   168	                      DoorFrame uses the QB error codes.
   169	 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   170	
   171	 2   Syntax Error                       61   Disk full
   172	 5   Ilegal Function Call               62   Input past end of File
   173	 6   Overflow                           63   Bad record number
   174	 7   Out of memory                      64   Bad filename
   175	11   Division by Zero                   67   Too many files
   176	13   type mismatch                      68   Device unavailable
   177	24   Device Timeout                     69   Comm-buffer overflow
   178	25   Device fault                       70   Permission denied
   179	52   Bad filename or number             71   Disk not ready
   180	53   File Not Found                     72   Disk media error
   181	55   File Already open                  74   Rename across disk
   182	57   Device I/O error                   75   Path/File access error
   183	58   File already exists                76   Path not found
   184	59   Bad Record length
   185	
   186	     The most common error that you will see is #62.  This is usually caused
   187	by the CFG file not having enough lines.  I have included this list so
   188	that you may be able to fix a problem that occurs with a T&J Software
   189	door.
   190	
   191	     Error #75 is usually an incorrect path and/or filename in the CFG
   192	file.
