     8	   Few people think of history as a "high-tech" discipline.
     9	Historians are commonly pictured as dusty souls rooting about in
    10	library stacks or in quaint archives, and struggling reluctantly
    11	with the trailing edges of the computer revolution.  University
    12	budgets leave us with computers that confirm the stereotype:  why
    13	waste precious resources on us when all we do is word processing?
    14	   The truth is, however, that what we do is far too
    15	sophisticated for mere computers.  Even the comparatively simple
    16	chore of handling a bibliography in multiple languages causes
    17	most computers indigestion.  Ask them to perform a competent
    18	translation and they gibber, thrown by slang or innuendo.  Go
    19	further and try to make a computer do what we actually do --
    20	inquire, explain, generalize -- and they draw a blank.  Compared
    21	to interpreting the English Civil War, modelling a weather system
    22	is child's play.
    23	   Until computers catch up with us, though, they can be put to
    24	use performing other chores.  One of the most promising arenas is
    25	in using computers as an adjunct to teaching.  This is a report
    26	on one such application:  using telecommunications to provide an
    27	alternative to the classroom.
    28	   In the fall semester of 1990 I taught "History of the
    29	Renaissance," a course traditional in content but novel in form
    30	in that it was conducted entirely using electronic mail via
    31	computers and modems:  we had no classroom, I delivered no
    32	lectures, and the students never met face to face.  I used a
    33	personal computer as the host for the class and all the students
    34	had their own computers.  Students, teacher, and administration
    35	alike considered the experiment a success, and we have plans to
    36	try more courses using this method.
    37	   How can one teach history without a classroom?  Quite easily,
    38	it turns out.  In order to discuss the course, though, it is
    39	necessary to explain first the mechanics of how the electronic
    40	classroom works before addressing pedagogical issues.
    41	   The key to the operation is an electronic bulletin board
    42	system, or BBS.  This is a combination of hardware and software
    43	that lets a single computer act as the electronic classroom, and
    44	it provides four main services:  messages, bulletins, files, and
    45	doors.
    46	   Messages are usually public, and they are readable at any time
    47	by any student.  In addition, students and instructor alike can
    48	post private messages that can be read only by the addressee.
    49	Bulletins are analogous to notices posted on a physical bulletin
    50	board, except they can be posted only by the instructor; this is
    51	where I include the course syllabus and other notices and
    52	announcements.  Besides sending and receiving messages, students
    53	can also send and receive files; these can be term papers,
    54	articles, even tutorial programs.  And doors act as doorways into
    55	other programs; using this feature it would be possible, for
    56	example, to administer a test electronically.
    57	   I conducted this class, which I whimsically called the
    58	"Electronic Renaissance," as a cross between a discussion group
    59	and directed readings, so the message feature was both the
    60	foundation and the center-piece.  Students would use their own
    61	computers to call the BBS, which had its own phone line and ran
    62	24 hours a day for the whole semester.  Using a few simple
    63	commands, they would receive all new messages, and then hang up,
    64	freeing the BBS for use by another student.  If the student
    65	forgot to hang up, the BBS would automatically disconnect the
    66	phone after a few minutes).
    67	   Students would then use their word processor to read messages.
    68	Some would be questions from other students, others might include
    69	contributions to on-going discussions or private messages from
    70	the professor.  Students would read all these, write replies to
    71	some, ask their own questions, or perhaps broach a new subject.
    72	He would then call the BBS back and post his new messages,
    73	thereby making them part of the general dialog.
    74	   Occasionally the student might download a file i.e., retrieve
    75	a document or other file from the BBS; even more rarely they
    76	might upload a file i.e., send a document to the BBS, but 90% of
    77	the course was comprised of sending and receiving messages --
    78	that is, in dialog.  The creation and management of this
    79	computer-mediated dialog formed the bulk of my duties as
    80	instructor and dictated the design of the course.
    81	   The discussions themselves were both similar to and different
    82	from a live classroom, with similarities outweighing differences
    83	substantially.  As in a classroom, some students were hesitant to
    84	voice their viewpoints, others spoke up almost from the first,
    85	while still others tended to ask questions rather than to write
    86	opinions.  Some messages were clearly stated while others were
    87	murky or ill-informed.
    88	   For all of that, the differences were quite obvious.  The most
    89	evident and most annoying was the delay between responses.  A
    90	student making an observation might not read some responses for
    91	several days, by which time the original "speaker" had moved on
    92	to other issues.  We all had to learn to accomodate ourselves to
    93	a more leisurely pace of conversation.  The fact that the BBS
    94	could keep track of several discussion topics at once compensated
    95	somewhat for the slower pace.
    96	   At the same time, the constraints of the medium caused other
    97	differences that I welcomed.  The most notable of these was the
    98	students' discovery that they had to cite their sources.  They
    99	quickly found they could not discuss the material without stating
   100	the book and page number that formed the basis of their question
   101	or observation.  From early in the course I began to see messages
   102	with quotations or paraphrases followed by an author and page
   103	number.  This also tended to keep the discussion focused on the
   104	ideas presented in the books; I saw very little pure opinion
   105	giving of the sort that I often hear in classroom discussion.
   106	The tone of the discussion was not only "this is what I think,"
   107	but also "this is the source from which I draw my opinion."
   108	   My major role in all of this was as moderator.  I posted the
   109	initial questions and made opening statements.  I brought the
   110	discussion back on track when it wandered or lost focus, and I
   111	tried to liven it when it flagged.  In short, I did what any
   112	professor does in a discussion class or seminar, only I did it in
   113	writing.
   114	   Student participation formed a quarter of the final grade.
   115	This, plus the requirement that each student post a minimum of
   116	three messages a week, ensured participation by everyone.  Some
   117	messages were obviously meant to meet only that minimum, but
   118	because there were no lectures and the students had to make their
   119	way through the readings on their own, they tended to ask a lot
   120	of questions.
   121	   As I began to create my syllabus, I found myself rethinking
   122	almost every aspect of the course:  What really were my
   123	objectives?  What should students learn about the Italian
   124	Renaissance?  What was vital and what expendable?  The change in
   125	the medium provided a catalyst for me to reevaluate form and
   126	content -- a worthwhile exercise in itself.
   127	   I decided, ultimately, not to try to reproduce my lectures.
   128	All my lecture notes were in my computer and I could easily have
   129	posted them, but they were outlines and nothing more.  The
   130	students, moreover, had purchased five books that covered various
   131	aspects of the subject thoroughly.  I had deliberately chosen
   132	books with differing viewpoints, and posting my "lectures" would
   133	have given away my own point of view.  I wanted the students to
   134	grapple with the material directly.  Besides, my goal was
   135	changing rapidly.  Rather than worrying about covering a certain
   136	amount of information in a semester's time, I believed the more
   137	important goal was to encourage the students to ask questions and
   138	to form opinions, since only that would produce discussion.
   139	   Once the course began, it became evident that certain kinds of
   140	background information were needed that were not supplied by the
   141	books.  I found myself writing messages of 100 lines or so as the
   142	need became evident from the discussions; for example, an
   143	explanation of medieval money, or a brief excursion into Church
   144	hierarchy.  What my students told me during and after the course
   145	was that they much appreciated these little essays.  If I teach
   146	this course with any regularity, I can envision building a
   147	library of these, to be pulled out as the occasion demands.
   148	   One obvious question that several faculty asked was:  What
   149	about the art?  After all, how can one teach the Renaissance
   150	without teaching the art?  I toyed with the idea of transmitting
   151	pictures.  This is technically possible, but I could not know
   152	whether the students' machines would have the speed and power
   153	needed to display the pictures.  I decided, instead, to spend
   154	only a couple of weeks on art and even there to concentrate more
   155	on patronage and other non-visual aspects.
   156	   I had two special projects for the course, one that worked
   157	well and one that did not.  Both were predicated on the
   158	assumption that this medium is well-suited to cooperative tasks
   159	with common goals.  The one that worked well was a time line
   160	students built together.  Everyone was required to post weekly a
   161	minimum of five contributions to the time line.  The events were
   162	to be related to the area currently under discussion; thus, if we
   163	were focusing on religion, they should be related to that.  I
   164	gathered the various contributions, eliminated duplicates, and
   165	merged all into a common time line that I posted as a file that
   166	the students could download and view or print.  I wanted the
   167	students to finish the course with a conception of Renaissance
   168	events that was of their own making.
   169	   A secondary goal of the time line project was to force the
   170	students to make some decisions as to relative historical
   171	importance.  I arbitrarily decided that the time line would be of
   172	a fixed length and would not be expanded; so, when I ran out of
   173	room, I asked the students which events were "worthy" of being
   174	included and which should be taken off.  Unfortunately, due to
   175	the small size of the class, we did not reach this point until
   176	almost the end of the semester, by which time the students were
   177	preoccupied with their term papers.  I would certainly use this
   178	project again, although I would simply force the issue earlier.
   179	Students are often told what is important -- by teachers and
   180	books; learning to decide some of this for themselves, I believe,
   181	is a vital part of their education.  This exercise made that
   182	process explicit:  they could see their own choices, compare them
   183	to those made by others, and reach a consensus through debate.
   184	   The project that did not work effectively failed primarily
   185	because I did not prepare well enough.  I had each student choose
   186	a city that, for the duration of the course, would be their
   187	responsibilty.  As discussions developed I hoped each student
   188	would be an advocate for his or her city, commenting on larger
   189	events from, say, a Venetian or Milanese perspective.
   190	   The problem, however, was twofold.  First, I did not provide
   191	enough structure.  I should have seeded the discussions with
   192	material that would inherently bring out differing points of view
   193	(e.g., relations with the papacy or with France).  Second, the
   194	students really needed more material to work with.  I should have
   195	selected the source readings, and maybe even one of the books,
   196	with a view to supporting this project. While the students made
   197	an effort at developing a local point of view, they eventually
   198	lost interest as stimulating debates failed to emerge.
   199	   I have detailed these two projects in an attempt to show the
   200	strengths and weaknesses of teaching through this medium.  In a
   201	traditional classroom one could draw a common time line and
   202	collect contributions, but it would be difficult to keep track of
   203	who contributed what; the administration of the project might
   204	turn into a nightmare.  The BBS approach, on the other hand,
   205	automatically provides the tracking needed for grading purposes
   206	because every student's message is date- and time-stamped.
   207	   But organization and planning are the key, as the failure of
   208	the second project attests.  The teacher has to have clearly in
   209	mind not only the rationale and objectives but the implementation
   210	as well.  If the course is not structured to support the project,
   211	then the project is not likely to succeed.  Because the students
   212	are at a distance, it is difficult to make ad hoc changes that
   213	require additional readings or other materials; the teacher
   214	cannot merely put an extra book on reserve in the library!
   215	   I decided early on that this course would have to be more
   216	highly structured than my traditional courses, that the students
   217	would need to know clearly what was expected of them, and so my
   218	syllabus contained more detail than usual.  As the basis of the
   219	class was discussion, it was especially important that everyone
   220	read the material at the same time.  The syllabus therefore laid
   221	out the reading assignments week by week (not my usual practice),
   222	along with general topic headings.  The students kept up with
   223	their work and the class generally ran smoothly.
   224	   The only serious hurdle I faced was the accessibility of
   225	library resources.  This was an upper-division history course,
   226	and a term paper was required.  But I had students living in
   227	rural communities and at some distance from the university
   228	library.
   229	   This was a real concern, but our university library has
   230	agreements with area public libraries for interlibrary loan
   231	services, and I worked out the details beforehand.  For my
   232	course, I used my computer to connect to our library's electronic
   233	system, where I searched for Renaissance-related books.  Using a
   234	feature of the catalog system, I was able to transfer the search
   235	results to a disk file, which I edited and then uploaded to the
   236	BBS.  Any student in a distant community now had the ability to
   237	download this customized bibliography, identify needed books, and
   238	order them through the local library.  As it turned out, all my
   239	students were within 25 miles of Boise and all drove to campus to
   240	get their books, but the approach was viable even if unused.
   241	   The library loan arrangements work for undergraduate research,
   242	but that is as far as I would want to push it.  Students could
   243	not, for example, use interlibrary loan to get a book from
   244	another university to their local library.  Likewise,
   245	interlibrary loan will not cover reference material, documents,
   246	maps or archival sources.  If a student were 150 miles from Boise
   247	and engaged in extensive graduate-level work, these constraints
   248	would be too severe.  There is, in other words, an academic limit
   249	to what one can do with this method.  I expect the limit to
   250	expand, but only slowly.
   251	   Registration, add-drops, books, and other administrative
   252	matters could in some places be a problem.  Our Continuing
   253	Education division, though, has had long experience in handling
   254	students who are physically remote from the campus, and it
   255	administered this course, too.  If a course like this is not
   256	coordinated through Continuing Education, or an equivalent
   257	division, teachers might have to attend to some of these matters
   258	themselves.
   259	   Because I ran this class in part as an experiment in distance
   260	education, I chose to teach the whole course by modem.  Others
   261	would not want to go quite so far.  One easy application is for
   262	the large lecture hall -- or even for the not-so-large -- where
   263	it is all but impossible to hold discussions.  By setting up a
   264	BBS service, a teacher can readily add a discussion element.
   265	Once set up, not only can teachers create and moderate
   266	discussions, they can post documents and students can use it to
   267	communicate among themselves and even to form study groups.  The
   268	key is that this is all done outside class time.
   269	   Obviously I believe the electronic classroom has potential,
   270	but what did the students think of it?  They thought very highly
   271	of it indeed, liking this format as an alternative to traditional
   272	classes.  None of them want to do away with live lectures, which
   273	always seem to be the preferred medium.  For my students,
   274	however, time was a premium.  They found themselves unable to
   275	attend any but night classes, and upper-division courses were
   276	rarely available at night.  Although what I did is placed under
   277	the rubric of "distance education," the important element for my
   278	students was not so much distance as time.  They either had to
   279	take a class in their free time, at odd hours, or they simply
   280	could not take the class at all.  They were unanimous in favoring
   281	this aspect of the class best because, with the BBS running
   282	continually, they could send and receive messages at any time, as
   283	could the professor.  No one was ever ignored, no one was ever
   284	interrupted, and the teacher knew exactly the extent and quality
   285	of participation.
   286	   They also told me, quite independently and after the class was
   287	over, that they had worked harder in this course than in most
   288	others.  They wanted their messages to look respectable, not
   289	foolish or sloppy, so they gave them careful attention.  Instead
   290	of proceeding carelessly through a class and only being rigorous
   291	for the term paper and the exams, they found they had to -- or
   292	wanted to -- perform at that level throughout the course.
   293	Moreover, because all of the factual information was in the books
   294	and they could not rely on classroom lectures, some students said
   295	they read their books more carefully and thoroughly than in their
   296	other courses.
   297	   The medium, therefore, seems to have some real, if rather
   298	subjective, educational strengths.  My own reaction was in
   299	harmony with the students:  I thought the general quality of
   300	student response was quite good.  Perhaps this is because only
   301	highly-motivated, well-organized students would risk a class like
   302	this, but I have heard a number of reports from other teachers at
   303	computer conferences who have used this approach and say much the
   304	same:  students like the format, they work hard, and the level of
   305	discussion is much higher than in a live classroom.  They also
   306	have noticed that "shy" students speak more freely when on-line
   307	and that racial and sex stereotypes are downplayed precisely
   308	because the social cues that come into play in a face-to-face
   309	discussion are absent in the electronic format.
   310	   Again I wish to emphasize that the advantages noted are quite
   311	appropriate for our discipline.  Discussing issues, asking
   312	questions, and presenting arguments are at the very core of what
   313	we do.  A live classroom allows for some of that but the
   314	electronic classroom may actually be superior in this regard.
   315	   For those wanting to know more about the computer technology
   316	involved, what follows is a summary of the technical side of the
   317	Electronic Renaissance.  For additional details, please contact
   318	me directly.
   319	   The host computer was an IBM XT running DOS 3.3 and PC Board
   320	version 14.2, with a 1200 baud modem.  I ran QMail 2.1 as a door
   321	out of the BBS, though only one student actually used this
   322	feature.  We ran a single phone line but had two phone numbers:
   323	one for local calls, plus an 800 number, to handle out-of-town
   324	calls, that was rotored onto the local exchange.  The students
   325	were allowed to have any hardware and software combination they
   326	wanted, but we strongly urged a particular combination that was
   327	PC-based.
   328	   This combination was a communications program called Robocomm
   329	and an off-line reader called EZ-Reader.  Robocomm is optimized
   330	for communicating with PC-Board and specifically for talking to
   331	mailer programs.  EZ-Reader takes the mail packets from QMail,
   332	unpacks them, and lets the user read messages and write replies.
   333	Uploads and downloads were handled within Robocomm.  These two
   334	products, in conjunction with QMail running on the host reduced
   335	daily connect time to under five minutes.  This made the 800
   336	charges affordable.  These programs are shareware and the
   337	students who chose them paid the registration fees (the shareware
   338	authors gave us a discount).
   339	   Support for this configuration took perhaps a total of ten
   340	hours in the first two weeks of the course.  After that, things
   341	ran smoothly.  The board never crashed, though it did go down
   342	once as the result of a power failure in the building; it came
   343	back up by itself when the power returned.  Students did call me
   344	once in a while, but none of the problems were serious, though
   345	solving them certainly would require more knowledge than most
   346	faculty have.  I have run the campus BBS since 1986 and so was
   347	comfortable with this technology, but that is admittedly an
   348	unusual situation.  Most campuses would have to turn tech support
   349	over to someone other than the instructor.
   350	   History courses lend themselves to the medium of asynchronous
   351	communication.  Historians deal primarily in words and ideas, and
   352	in the processes of inquiry, analysis and communication, which
   353	are just the kind of services a BBS provides.  One traditional
   354	format for history study is the seminar; my BBS-based system
   355	adheres closely to that approach.
   356	   The workload for the instructor, as with a lecture-only
   357	course, can vary widely.  I certainly spent less time on this
   358	course than I would if it had been live, but I could also have
   359	spent far more than I did.  This is driven more by the ambitions
   360	and goals of the instructor than by the demands and limitations
   361	of the technology.
   362	   Students favor the format.  They like the flexibility for
   363	their own schedules, the freedom to speak whenever they wish, the
   364	idea that they can speak publicly or privately to anyone.  They
   365	also like the feeling that they are active participants in their
   366	own education.
   367	   The technology is affordable.  Even my full-bore approach was
   368	relatively cheap, and there are alternatives that are more
   369	limited but that are free or nearly so.  Administrations will
   370	probably like it.  Distance education is popular, and faculty may
   371	be able to get monetary support from your deans or academic
   372	vice-presidents.  Who knows, there is even the possibility of
   373	creating a publication out of the experience!
