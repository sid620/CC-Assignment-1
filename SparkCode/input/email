     1	Policies on electronic mail - a summary
     2	---------------------------------------
     3	
     4	Attached is an edited summary of the responses I received on my recent
     5	query. 
     6	
     7	The majority of respondents didn't have a formal mail policy, although
     8	there was some unspoken agreement on it. 
     9	
    10	At least one formal mail policy is attached. Some organisations seem
    11	to have come to grips with the problem extremely well - as the following
    12	(rough) quote from the Sun Microsystems internal handbook 'Email Survival'
    13	illustrates.
    14	
    15	'Accessing another persons personal electronic mail or files without 
    16	their specific permission is considered gross misconduct. The ease with 
    17	which this might be done in no way justifies this intrusion. Printed copy 
    18	awaiting pickup from a printer is equally confidential  material. Any 
    19	misconduct of this type may result in the termination of your employment
    20	with Sun'.
    21	
    22	Thanks to all who helped out. Also, some people requested anonymity
    23	so I decided it would be best to strip out all identifying information
    24	from the summary. If you would like to discuss something with any
    25	particular correspondent, no doubt I can arrange it!

    34	--- Comments from commercial site administrators and users ---
    35	
    36	We take e-mail very seriously -- both on our own systems and on those that
    37	we administer on behalf of our clients. I view e-mail in the same light as
    38	paper mail. Accordingly, we make every effort to ensure timely delivery
    39	and privacy. Our staff are encouraged to use the facility and we make no
    40	distinction between business and personal correspondence.
    41	
    42	We are sufficiently small that abuses of this privilege can be dealt with
    43	at a personal level. In the three years that we've had network access,
    44	only one user has been troublesome. In this case, the user was sending
    45	inappropriate quantities of data via the e-mail system and that person has
    46	been encouraged to seek alternative methods (magnetic media) of data
    47	interchange.
    48	
    49	So far, I have not found it necessary to formulate written policy on this
    50	subject although recent activities that have been reported in the U.S.
    51	have prompted me to consider doing so.
    52	
    53	---
    54	
    55	[1]  We're a commercial site, an employee-owned firm.
    56	
    57	[2]  All email is private to the extent we can make it so under fairly
    58	standard System V setups.  Directories for spooling are locked, although
    59	a dedicated person could probably find a hole somewhere.  Privacy is
    60	only knowingly compromised when a user needs file repair, and even
    61	then the user is warned that someone will probably see the mailfile
    62	or spooled message as surgery if performed.
    63	
    64	[3]  We don't consider net-correspondence or personal routing to be a
    65	problem.  In fact, we helped an employee figure out a path to his
    66	daughter during the summer.
    67	
    68	[4]  Nobody at our site has precipitated a net flame-war, so the issue
    69	of abuse has not come up.  Were it to occur I suppose we would give
    70	the party in question a reprimand on the first offense, and we would
    71	have to handle additional problems on an ad-hoc basis.  We try to
    72	be flexible; so far we haven't [KNOCK WOOD] had a major test.
    73	
    74	--
    75	
    76	This is certainly [not] an official educational mail policy, it is merely a
    77	note reguarding my experience.
    78	
    79	Although I realise that you, as a systems administrator, have a duty to
    80	maintain security on your site, particularly now with AARNet connectivity,
    81	I feel that the reading of someone elses personal mail is a gross injustice.
    82	Despite the fact that you probably have every right to read the mail (they
    83	have chosen to place them on your machine), it is degrading and leads to
    84	animosity between staff and students.  As a sysadm myself now, I will
    85	never read someones mail even if i suspect them of breaching security.
    86	
    87	---
    88	
    89	On mail abuse.  Of all organisational e-mail setups I've come
    90	across (not that many, but I think sufficient to make correlation),
    91	at least 30% of all intra-orgainisational email traffic is 
    92	of a social nature.
    93	
    94	In one instance, numerous mis/comms managers of a major international bank
    95	that I've dealt with confessed, under social/relaxed settings that they
    96	reckon more than 1/2 of all mail in their system were invitations, replies,
    97	greetings and felicitations and such like.  They were using IBM/Profs and
    98	a population of ~7000 users worldwide.
    99	
   100	My thought: I don't think there is any feasible active policy 
   101	you just have to rely on your employees to be professional about it.
   102	
   103	--- Responses from academic site administrators and users ---
   104	
   105	As far as we are concerned e-mail and e-news is there to be used, the more
   106	students use it the better since they begin to use the computer systems
   107	voluntarily.. not just to do their projects.
   108	(some of them are even buyng e-mail accounts on commerical systems)
   109	
   110	There aren't any charges or accounting..
   111	
   112	---
   113	
   114	I've had no problems here in ******.  Hopefull, the mail is
   115	private.  there have been no rules set down for the use of
   116	personal mail, and in fact one of the groups I use could
   117	only be called personal.  The news also is personal I guess,
   118	as alt.sex or such could hardly be called work!  (something
   119	for tea breaks).
   120	
   121	There is of course lots of official things passing through,
   122	and who determines what is personal and what is strictly
   123	university work?
   124	
   125	---
   126	
   127	No official policies at ******.  In general, anyone (staff or student) is 
   128	permitted to use mail to anywhere.
   129	
   130	Privacy - people are warned that mail is not secure and confidential
   131	information should be sent by other means. 
   132	
   133	Abuse - the universal threat: misuse of computer systems may result in
   134	disabling of accounts (and consequent failure for students because of 
   135	inability to complete assigned work.  We always warn people, and one warning 
   136	has proven sufficient so far.) 
   137	
   138	Personal messages - no rules, just the general statement that applies to 
   139	computing generally "People doing University work have priority for use of 
   140	terminals, etc".  This is sort of enforceable, in the sense that anyone 
   141	wanting to use a terminal can complain to the person doing private work, and 
   142	then to the system manager if necessary.  We rarely have complaints.  As far 
   143	as checking for private mail, there are hundreds of messages a day go from 
   144	here, and I don't have the time or inclination to read it.  I don't really see 
   145	any problems with people sending private messages, after all, universities are 
   146	supposed to be places of open thinking, etc, etc, etc.  (It would be different 
   147	if it was costing us anything, such as people printing out dozens of 
   148	invitations on our laser printer!)
   149	
   150	---
   151	
   152	.......................................There is no point in adopting
   153	rules you cannot enforce.  In particular there is no way of enforcing rules
   154	agains the use of email for personal messages unless you want to adopt the
   155	distastful and tediously boring practice of reading all messages.
   156	
   157	New computer users are given a statement describing their
   158	computer access as a privilege, not a right, and with some guidelines as to
   159	proper use.  There is always the implication that if they abuse their privileges
   160	they can lose them.  If a user starts sending abusive email, you would probably
   161	hear a complaint from the recipient and could take action.  If users send
   162	multi-megabyte email messages you (or your postmaster) will probably see the
   163	error messages when they bounce, and again can take appropriate action.  In
   164	our case appropriate action is usually a warning, followed up by account
   165	suspension in the rare cases of repeat offenders.
   166	
   167	 As for privacy of email, I follow the practice that in principle email should
   168	be private, but that in practice they should not assume this.  I post occasional
   169	warnings that I as postmaster, and presumably postmasters at other sites, will
   170	sometimes see a copy of their mail when an error occurs, sometimes due to no
   171	fault of the sender.  I also inform users that system administrators technically
   172	have access to all files on the system, and may occasionally need to read user
   173	files to resolve system problems.
   174	
   175	 My personal policy is to never divulge the contents of email I happen to see,
   176	even when that email contents suggests gross abuse.  However I have no
   177	such hesitation in divulging information obtained from system log files, which
   178	list such information as sender and recipient addresses, message length, etc.
   179	Since these log files are publicly readable (even though most users do not even
   180	know they exist), I consider them public information.
   181	
   182	---
   183	
   184	There has been a discussion on TECHREP@BITNIC.BITNET on electronic mail
   185	privacy/policy lately.  If you are not a TECHREP, I would suggest you
   186	subscribe to TECHNEWS@BITNIC.BITNET as it is an open re-distribution of the
   187	TECHREP list.
   188	
   189	Send your subscription request to LISTSERC@BITNIC.BITNET in a mail message
   190	with the first line  being "SUB TECHREP (or TECHNEWS) <Your Name>"

   245	
   246	I'd be most interested in a summary.  The official policy at ***** is
   247	that we have to use our computer accounts for "educational pursuits"
   248	(or equally legal sounding stuff).  A fairly high level of privacy
   249	exists, although the university reserves the right to read our email.
   250	
   251	---
   252	
   253	There are paragraphs alluding to many aspects of the e-mail issue
   254	in various Internet RFC documents (I can't cite them by chapter and
   255	verse off-hand, but one that comes to mind is the Security Policy
   256	Handbook that is in fairly advanced draft right now ... it is
   257	prepared by the Secuirty Policy Handbook Working Group (SPWG) and
   258	you can get it by anonymous FTP from cert.sei.cmu.edu (look for
   259	an "obvious" subdirectory).
   260	
   261	Let me advance the following by way as a rough guess at to what you
   262	will find:
   263	(1) Many sites will have no official policies.
   264	(2) Some sites will have official policies prepared to satisfy the
   265	    legal staff and bean-counters: these policies will sound very
   266	    nice and complete but in fact be largely impractical to
   267	    implement.
   268	(3) Some sites will have policies based on experience and knowledge
   269	    of the technical staff: these policies will point out that e-mail
   270	    ain't secure unless encrypted and that security is inversely
   271	    proportional to ease and convenience of use of a system.
   272	
   273	I suspect, too, that the top levels of administrations that tend to
   274	think in terms of official policies, are also the ones who least
   275	understand the technology and what really can and can't be done.
   276	
   277	---
   278	
   279	I am sysadmin of ********
   280	
   281	We have 70+ users.
   282	
   283	We have no policy in place.
   284	
   285	Users are free to use email for whatever purpose they like.
   286	
   287	and they do use it.
   288	
   289	We use standard Unix mail which means each user's mailbox is private
   290	with the exception of root, who can look at anyone's mail.
   291	
   292	---
   293	
   294	It was interesting that you should raise this on info-nets. So I
   295	would like to share with you my thoughts on the subject, having worked
   296	and researched in the human factor in global email since 1982.
   297	
   298	I think that the coming of AARNet and the tremedous promotion work
   299	that Geoff Huston and his group is doing will advance the use of
   300	email in Australia. It mighe not be a good idea at this early stage
   301	to insist that email should be used for "official" business, as it
   302	will be extremely difficult to define what is official, work, and what
   303	is personal and private use. To do so will dampen the learning and usage
   304	enthusiasm of the lay people. I have been a member of a number of overseas
   305	conferencing systems, and quite frankly, a lot of the messages have only
   306	social values, but they are important all the same, as they are crucial
   307	to group dynamcis and group affinity.
   308	
   309	---
   310	
   311	OK, here's the Dartmouth policy plus a disclaimer from the manual
   312	for the Dartmouth-developed e-mail application:
   313	
   314	         DARTMOUTH COLLEGE COMPUTING CODE OF ETHICS
   315	
   316	The Computing Code of Ethics was formulated and is endorsed by
   317	Dartmouth's Council on Computing, a faculty committee that
   318	advises Dartmouth on questions of policy concerning the
   319	allocation and use of all computing resources.  The council takes
   320	an active role in determining the standard computing environment
   321	on campus and participates in planning and reviewing projects
   322	that will significantly affect computing at Dartmouth.  The
   323	Council on Computing wholly endorses the Dartmouth Computing Code
   324	of Ethics as follows:
   325	
   326	Computer use.  The Computing Code of Ethics states that every
   327	user of Dartmouth College Computing has two fundamental rights: 
   328	privacy and a fair share of resources.  It is unethical for any
   329	other user to violate these rights.  Violation of the Computing
   330	Code of Ethics is considered a violation of the Academic Honor
   331	Principle and may subject a student to disciplinary action.
   332	
   333	Kiewit Network privacy.  Each user number and associated password
   334	belongs to an individual, department, or school.  No one else
   335	should use a user number without explicit permission from the
   336	owner.  All use should be in accordance with Dartmouth policy on
   337	computer use set forth in this document.  Owners accept the
   338	burden for the responsible use and dissemination of their user
   339	number.
   340	
   341	Programs and files belong to the owner of the user number or
   342	catalog containing the programs and files.  They are presumed to
   343	be private and confidential unless the owner has explicitly made
   344	them available to the public.  When necessary for the maintenance
   345	of a system or network, Kiewit Computation Center personnel may
   346	access others' files.
   347	
   348	Some programs gather information about the users who run them. 
   349	If such information could be used to identify the user and the
   350	user's use of the program, the user should be warned and given a
   351	chance to leave the program before data collection begins.
   352	
   353	Use of a the network and/or electronic mail facilities for
   354	transmitting rude, abusive, harassing, or malicious messages is
   355	unethical.
   356	
   357	Personally owned computer resources.  The unauthorized copying of
   358	any software that is licensed or protected by copyright is theft
   359	and thus unethical.
   360	
   361	Programs and files that belong to the owner of a personal
   362	computer enjoy the same rights of privacy afforded to programs
   363	and files resident on the Kiewit Network computers.  They are
   364	presumed to be private and confidential.
   365	
   366	Resources.  No one should deliberately attempt to degrade Kiewit
   367	system, network, or personal computer performance, nor to deprive
   368	other users of the resources of or the authorized access to any
   369	Dartmouth- or individually-owned computer.
   370	
   371	Loopholes in the Kiewit computer system or network or knowledge
   372	of a special password should not be used to damage computer
   373	systems or networks, to obtain unauthorized resources, or take
   374	resources from other users.
   375	
   376	No Dartmouth-owned computing resource should be used for
   377	unauthorized commercial purposes.
   378	
   379	When necessary for the maintenance of a system or network, Kiewit
   380	Computation Center personnel may restrict availability of shared
   381	resources.
   382	
   383	                   ELECTRONIC MAIL INFORMATION
   384	           (Not Part of the Computing Code of Ethics)
   385	
   386	Privacy information.  The privacy of electronic mail is somewhere
   387	between that of a letter and a postcard.  Electronic mail is not
   388	entirely confidential.  There may be instances where the
   389	postmaster may have to gain access to a message to determine if
   390	something is wrong with the address, or the message may be
   391	delivered inadvertently to the wrong address.
   392	
   393	--
   394	
   395	I'm the postmaster here for the Department of Computer Science,
   396	and thus for a bunch of student systems as well as the staff network.
   397	We don't really have an official policy that I know of for electronic
   398	mail, but I think some of the unofficial ideas we've been working with
   399	may be of interest to you. I'm interested in any other replies you
   400	receive, so if you don't get enough to post to the net, could you email
   401	me a copy please ?
   402	
   403	During the period ******* through to *******, network access for students was 
   404	completely open. They were allowed to send mail anywhere they liked, and 
   405	FTP from the States, telnet into machines over there and try to break into
   406	people's computers :-(.
   407	
   408	At some point this "feature" was mentioned to the bigwigs here, who
   409	immediately determined that undergraduate students should not have
   410	AARnet access. The very idea of undergrads being able to send mail
   411	overseas was quite unthinkable. Naturally, the implementation of such a
   412	restriction required a bit of thought, because students do need access
   413	to utilities like telnet and so on to communicate between machines on
   414	campus. Eventually we decided to try not running routed on the
   415	machines, thereby making attempts to reach systems outside the
   416	physically connected network return the message : Network unreachable.
   417	
   418	This has been fairly successful, although because our campus network is
   419	subnetted, we have needed on occasion to add a special static route
   420	into Multigate boxes to talk to Macintosh labs and so on. The one big
   421	disadvantage of it is that no-one on the machine can reach off camous,
   422	so staff users can't mail overseas from such a crippled machine, for
   423	instance. Apart from trying to follow the commandments of the
   424	powers-that-be, we were also pleased to be able to stop students from
   425	FTPing vast numbers of raster images from US sites. (Since disk quotas
   426	were mistakenly not turned on at the beginning of the semester, I mean
   427	VAST numbers).
   428	
   429	In any case, although I've never sighted an "official" policy or even
   430	an official memo telling us what we should and should not let the
   431	students do, I thought you might find what we've been doing
   432	interesting, since it is my vague understanding that not many other
   433	AARnet member sites are restricting student access (?).

   437	Your message also mentions other issues such as mail abuse, privacy of
   438	mail etc. Again we don't seem to have a clearcut official policy
   439	although we do have a "Principles of Responsible Use" document which
   440	students are expected to pay some attention to. It explicitly says
   441	"users should not...attempt to intercept any network communications,
   442	such as electronic mail...".  It goes on to say "Actions taken by users
   443	intentionally to interfere with or alter the integrity of the system
   444	are out of bounds. Such actions include ...impersonation of other
   445	individuals in communications...". I think that this document is a
   446	locally written thing, and isn't circulated to the other larger student
   447	site on campus.

   449	As far as privacy of mail goes, I was quite surprised to hear most of
   450	our lecturers agreeing that as far as they were concerned, students'
   451	mail was an "open book". Some of the first year lecturers in particular
   452	are very concerned with plagiarism, and seem to often browse through
   453	student mailboxes to try and detect it. I'm pretty sure that they want
   454	to treat it as an open book, but have no intention of telling the
   455	students that that is the case. As a postmaster, my immediate reaction
   456	is that such an attitude is rather unethical.
