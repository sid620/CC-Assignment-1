    15	NU 5.0 FILEFIND TIP
    16	
    17	Are you tired of FILEFIND searching each matching file on your
    18	disk for a text string when all you really wanted was to limit
    19	the seach to the matching files in the directory you were in at
    20	the moment?  If you can't always remember the command line switches
    21	here's a simple little batch file called LF.BAT (for 'local find'):
    22	 
    23	FF .\%1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9     ;For example: LF yourtext
    24	 
    25	Place it in your path.  Simple and more intuitive than remembering
    26	to type ".\*.*" or "/C".
    27

    29	SYSTEM SHUT-DOWN TIP
    30	
    31	Here's another slick little batch file that will give your hard disk
    32	a quick once over and defrag it before you shut-down for the day.
    33	As an option you could add a disk park program of your choice.
    34	
    35	QUIT.BAT
    36	
    37	NDD C: /QUICK      ;Norton Disk Doctor /QUICK=just test system area
    38	SD C: /U /A /V     ;Speed Disk /U=update /A=all /V=volume
    39	PARK               ;Use any 'park' utility on hard disk
    40	                   ;shut power off
    41	 
    42	If you have multiple partitions on your hard disk be sure to add the
    43	same commands for each drive.

    46	NORTON COMMANDER 3.0 ZIP VIEWER
    47	
    48	Norton Commander 3.0 has the capabilty to view many major file formats
    49	except .ZIP files.  Future versions are rumoured to have this capability.
    50	For now you could try the following:
    51	
    52	1. Edit (or create) your NC.EXT file to include:
    53	         ZIP: PKUNZIP -V !.!     ;allows you to 'view' the contents
    54	2. Park your cursor on the zip file and press Enter
    55	3. Use the NC command CTRL-E to actually unzip the file after 'viewing'
    56	         edit out the '-V' option and press Enter again to unzip
