    11	Moderator's note: The following article is a lengthy excerpt from a
    12	recent issue of FIDONEWS concerning individual privacy and the use of
    13	aliases or handles in computer-based communications.  It was submitted by
    14	a comp.society reader who used a handle; because the excerpt is a cross-
    15	post from another electronic publication, I have taken the liberty of
    16	viewing the use of a handle by sender as a request for privacy and
    17	anonymity similar to the request a newspaper editor might receive in a
    18	letter to the editor.  Thus, while reprinting the submission, the name
    19	and address of the sender are "withheld upon request."  The article
    20	raises a number of good points; the submission by a reader using a handle
    21	to preserve anonymity makes a point; and the editorial action of
    22	submitting the reader's posting anonymously makes the question current.
    23	What are the implications of using aliases on the net?

    83	We should never so entirely avoid danger as to appear
    84	irresolute and cowardly.  But, at the same time, we should
    85	avoid unnecessarily exposing ourselves to danger, than
    86	which nothing can be more foolish.  [Cicero]

    93	Do you trust me?
    94	
    95	If you participate in computer conferencing, and you use
    96	your real name, then you'd better.
    97	
    98	"Why?", you ask.  "What can you do with my name?"  To start
    99	with, given that and your origin line, I can probably look
   100	you up in your local phone book, and find out where you
   101	live.  Even if you are unlisted, there are ways to locate
   102	you based on your name.  If you own any property, or pay any
   103	utility bills, your address is a matter of public record.
   104	Do you have children in the public schools?  It would be
   105	easy to find out.  But that's just the beginning.

   107	Former Chairman of the U.S. Privacy Protection Commission
   108	David F. Linowes, in his book "Privacy in America" (1989),
   109	writes of New York private investigator Irwin Blye:
   110	
   111	    "Challenged to prove his contention that, given a little
   112	    time and his usual fee, he could learn all about an
   113	    individual without even speaking with him, Blye was
   114	    presented with a subject -- a New Jersey
   115	    newspaperman....  The result was a five-page, single-
   116	    spaced, typed report which documented, though not always
   117	    accurately, a wide sweep of the journalist's past, and
   118	    was detailed to the point of disclosing his father's
   119	    income before his retirement."
   120	
   121	Who am I?  If I don't post, you might not even know I exist.
   122	I could be on your local Police Department, or an agent
   123	working with the IRS, or some federal law-enforcement
   124	agency.  I could be a member of some fanatical hate group,
   125	or criminal organization.  I might even be a former Nixon
   126	White-House staffer!
   127	
   128	I could be that pyromaniacal teenager you flamed last
   129	weekend, for posting a step-by-step description of how he
   130	made plastic explosive in his high-school chem lab.  He
   131	seemed kind of mad.
   132	
   133	But you're an upstanding citizen; you have nothing to hide.
   134	So why not use your name on the nets?  Trust me.  There's
   135	nothing to worry about.
   136

   144	      Stupidity is evil waiting to happen.  [Clay Bond]
   145	
   146	
   147	Not long ago in Fidonet's BCSNET echo (the Boston Computer
   148	Society's national conference), the following was posted by
   149	the conference moderator to a user calling himself "Captain
   150	Kirk":
   151	
   152	      "May we ask dear Captain Kirk that it would be very
   153	      polite if you could use your real name in an echomail
   154	      conference? This particular message area is shared
   155	      with BBS's all across the country and everyone else is
   156	      using their real name. It is only common courtesy to
   157	      do so in an echomail conference."
   158	
   159	One of us (mkj) responded with a post questioning that
   160	policy.  Soon the conference had erupted into a heated
   161	debate!  Although mkj had worried that the subject might be
   162	dismissed as trivial, it apparently touched a nerve.  It
   163	brought forth debate over issues and perceptions central to
   164	computer communications in general, and it revealed profound
   165	disparities in fundamental values and assumptions among
   166	participants.
   167	
   168	This article is a response to that debate, and to the
   169	prevailing negative attitudes regarding the use of handles.
   170	Handles seem to have a bad reputation.  Their use is
   171	strangely unpopular, and frequently forbidden by network
   172	authorities.  Many people seem to feel that handles are rude
   173	or dishonest, or that anyone wishing to conceal his or her
   174	identity must be up to no good.  It is the primary purpose
   175	of this article to dispel such prejudices.
   176	
   177	Let us make one thing perfectly clear here at the outset: We
   178	do NOT challenge the need or the right of sysops to know the
   179	identities of their users!  But we do believe that a sysop
   180	who collects user names has a serious responsibility to
   181	protect that information.  This means making sure that no
   182	one has access to the data without a legal warrant, and it
   183	certainly means not pressuring users to broadcast their real
   184	names in widespread public forums such as conferences.

   192	
   193	
   194	Andy Warhol said that "In the future, everyone will be
   195	famous for fifteen minutes".  The computer nets, more than
   196	any other medium, lend credibility to this prediction.  A
   197	network conference may span the globe more completely than
   198	even satellite TV, yet be open to anyone who can afford the
   199	simplest computer and modem. Through our participation in
   200	conferencing, each of us becomes, if only briefly, a public
   201	figure of sorts -- often without realizing it, and without
   202	any contemplation of the implications and possible
   203	consequences.
   204	
   205	Brian Reid (reid@decwrl.DEC.COM) conducts and distributes
   206	periodic surveys of Usenet conference readership.  His
   207	statistical results for the end of 1991 show that of the
   208	1,459 conferences which currently make up Usenet, more than
   209	fifty percent have over 20,000 readers apiece; the most
   210	popular conferences are each seen by about 200,000 readers!
   211	Mr. Reid's estimate of total Usenet readership is nearly TWO
   212	MILLION people.
   213	
   214	Note that Mr. Reid's numbers are for Usenet only; they do
   215	not include any information on other large public nets such
   216	as RIME (PC-Relaynet), Fido, or dozens of others, nor do
   217	they take into account thousands of private networks which
   218	may have indirect public network connections. The total
   219	number of users with access to public networks is unknown,
   220	but informed estimates range to the tens of millions, and
   221	the number keeps growing at an amazing pace -- in fact, the
   222	rate of growth of this medium may be greater than any other
   223	communications medium in history.
   224	
   225	The special problems and risks which arise when one deals
   226	with a large public audience are something about which most
   227	computer users have little or no experience or
   228	understanding.  Until recently, those of us involved in
   229	computer conferencing have comprised a small and rather
   230	elite community.  The explosion in network participation is
   231	catching us all a little unprepared.
   232	
   233	Among media professionals and celebrities, on the other
   234	hand, the risks of conducting one's business in front of a
   235	public audience are all too familiar.  If the size of one's
   236	audience becomes sufficiently large, one must assume that
   237	examples of virtually every personality type will be
   238	included: police and other agents of various governments,
   239	terrorists, murderers, rapists, religious fanatics, the
   240	mentally ill, robbers and con artists, et al ad infinitum.
   241	It must also be assumed that almost anything you do, no
   242	matter how innocuous, could inspire at least one person,
   243	somewhere, to harbor ill will toward you.
   244	
   245	The near-fatal stabbing of actress Theresa Saldana is a case
   246	in point. As she was walking to her car one morning near her
   247	West Hollywood apartment, a voice behind her asked, "Are you
   248	Theresa Saldana?"; when she turned to answer, a man she had
   249	never seen before pulled out a kitchen knife and stabbed her
   250	repeatedly.
   251	
   252	After her lengthy and painful recovery, she wrote a book on
   253	the experience ("Beyond Survival", 1986).  In that book she
   254	wrote:
   255	
   256	
   257	     [pg 12]  "... Detective Kalas informed me that the
   258	     assailant, whom he described as a Scottish drifter, had
   259	     fixated upon me after seeing me in films."
   260	
   261	     [pg 28]  "... it was through my work as an actress that
   262	     the attacker had fixated on me.  Naturally, this made
   263	     me consider getting out of show business ..."
   264	
   265	     [pg 34]  "For security, I adopted an alias and became
   266	     'Alicia Michaels.'  ... during the months that followed
   267	     I grew so accustomed to it that, to this day, I still
   268	     answer reflexively when someone calls the name Alicia!"
   269	
   270	Or consider the fate of Denver radio talk show host Alan
   271	Berg, who in 1984 died outside his home in a hail of
   272	gunfire.  Police believe he was the victim of a local neo-
   273	nazi group who didn't like his politics.
   274	
   275	We are reminded of the murders of John Lennon and Rebecca
   276	Shaffer; the Reagan/Hinckley/Foster incident; and a long
   277	string of other "celebrity attacks" of all sorts, including
   278	such bizarre events as the occupation of David Letterman's
   279	home by a strange woman who claimed to be his wife! There is
   280	probably no one in public life who doesn't receive at least
   281	the occassional threatening letter.
   282	
   283	Of course, ordinary participants in network conferencing may
   284	never attract quite the attention that other types of
   285	celebrities attract. But consider the following, rather less
   286	apocalyptic scenarios:
   287	
   288	    --  On Friday night you post a message to a public
   289	        conference defending an unpopular or controversial
   290	        viewpoint.  On Monday morning your biggest client
   291	        cancels a major contract. Or you are kept up all
   292	        night by repeated telephone calls from someone
   293	        demanding that you "stop killing babies"!
   294	
   295	    --  You buy your teenage son or daughter a computer and
   296	        modem.  Sometime later you find your lawn littered
   297	        with beer bottles and dug up with tire marks, or
   298	        your home vandalized or burglarized.
   299	
   300	    --  One day you are nominated to the Supreme Court.  Who
   301	        are all these strange people on TV claiming to be
   302	        your friends? How did that fellow know your position
   303	        on abortion?  Your taste in GIFs?
   304	
   305	Celebrities and other professional media personalities
   306	accept the risks and sacrifices of notoriety, along with the
   307	benefits, as part of their chosen careers.  Should computer
   308	conference participants be expected to do the same?  And who
   309	should be making these decisions?
   310	
   311	                        *  *  *  *  *

   313	                         OTHER MEDIA

   315	
   316	  When thou art at Rome, do as they do at Rome  [Cervantes]
   317	
   318	
   319	Older media seem to address the problems of privacy very
   320	differently than computer media, at least so far.  We are
   321	not aware of ANY medium or publication, apart from computer
   322	conferencing, where amateur or even most professional
   323	participants are required to expose their true names against
   324	their will.  Even celebrities frequently use "stage names",
   325	and protect their addresses and phone numbers as best they
   326	can.
   327	
   328	When a medium caters specifically to the general public,
   329	participants are typically given even greater opportunities
   330	to protect their privacy. Television talk shows have been
   331	known to go so far as to employ silhouetting and electronic
   332	alteration of voices to protect the identities of guests,
   333	and audience members who participate are certainly not
   334	required to state their full names before speaking.
   335	
   336	The traditional medium most analogous to computer
   337	conferencing may be talk radio.  Like conferencing, talk
   338	radio is a group discussion and debate medium oriented
   339	toward controversy, where emotions can run high. Programs
   340	often center around a specific topic, and are always run by
   341	a "host" whose role seems analogous in many respects to that
   342	of a conference moderator.  It is therefore worth noting
   343	that in talk radio generally, policy seems to be that
   344	callers are identified on the air only by their first names
   345	(unless of course they volunteer more).
   346	
   347	Finally, of course, authors have published under "pen names"
   348	since the dawn of publishing, and newspapers and magazines
   349	frequently publish letters to the editor with "name and
   350	address withheld by request" as the signature line. Even
   351	founding fathers Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John
   352	Jay, in authoring the seminal Federalist Papers in 1787 for
   353	publication in the Letters columns of various New York City
   354	newspapers, concealed their identities behind the now-famous
   355	psuedonym "Publius".
   356	
   357	What would you think if someone called a radio talk show
   358	demanding to know the identity of a previous caller?  Such a
   359	demand would undoubtedly be seen as menacing and
   360	inappropriate in that context.  Yet that same demand seems
   361	to arise without much challenge each time a handle shows up
   362	in a computer conference.  The authors of this article feel
   363	that such demands should always be looked upon as
   364	suspicious, and that it would be beneficial for moderators
   365	to take upon themselves the responsibility of making sure
   366	that besieged handle-users are aware of their right to
   367	refuse such inappropriate demands.
   368	
   369	It is reasonable to assume that privacy policies in
   370	traditional media are the result of hard-won wisdom gained
   371	from long experience.  Are we so arrogant that we cannot
   372	learn from others?  It is not hard to imagine the sorts of
   373	problems and experiences which shaped these policies in the
   374	old media.  Will we have to wait for similar problems to
   375	occur on the computer networks before we learn?

   381	
   382	        In an effort to identify people who fail to file tax
   383	        returns, the Internal Revenue Service is matching
   384	        its files against available lists of names and
   385	        addresses of U.S. citizens who have purchased
   386	        computers for home use. The IRS continues to seek
   387	        out sources for such information. This information
   388	        is matched against the IRS master file of taxpayers
   389	        to see if those who have not filed can be
   390	        identified.

   397	        I just had an interesting visit from the FBI.  It
   398	        seems that a posting I made to sci.space several
   399	        months ago had filtered through channels, caused the

   424	
   425	Most of us have been brought up to be grateful for the fact
   426	that we live in a nation where freedom is sacred.  In other
   427	countries, we are told as children, people are afraid to
   428	speak their minds for fear they are being watched.  Thank
   429	God we live in America!
   430	
   431	It would surprise most of us to learn that America is
   432	currently among the premiere surveillance nations in the
   433	world, but such, sadly, is indeed the case.  Our leadership
   434	in technology has helped the U.S. government to amass as
   435	much information on its citizens as almost any other nation
   436	in history, totalitarian or otherwise.  And to make matters
   437	worse, a consumer surveillance behemoth has sprung up
   438	consisting of huge private data-collection agencies which
   439	cater to business.
   440	
   441	As Evan Hendricks, editor of "Privacy Times" (a Washington
   442	D.C.-based newsletter) has put it: "You go through life
   443	dropping bits and pieces of information about yourself
   444	everywhere.  Most people don't realize there are big vacuum
   445	cleaners out there sucking it all up."  [Wall Street
   446	Journal, March 14, 1991].
   447	
   448	To get an idea of how much of your privacy has already been
   449	lost, consider the bits and pieces of information about
   450	yourself which are already available to investigators, and
   451	how thoroughly someone might come to know you by these clues
   452	alone.
   453	
   454	A person's lifestyle and personality are largely described,
   455	for example, by his or her purchases and expenses; from your
   456	checking account records -- which banks are required by law
   457	to keep and make available to government investigators -- a
   458	substantial portrait of your life will emerge. Credit card
   459	records may reveal much of the same information, and can
   460	also be used to track your movements. (In a recent case,
   461	"missing" Massachusetts State Representative Timothy O'Leary
   462	was tracked by credit-card transactions as he fled across
   463	the country, and his movements were reported on the nightly
   464	news!)
   465	
   466	Then there are your school records, which include IQ and
   467	other test results, comments on your "socialization" by
   468	teachers and others, and may reveal family finances in great
   469	detail.  Employment and tax records reveal your present
   470	income, as well as personal comments by employers and co-
   471	workers.  Your properties are another public record of your
   472	income and lifestyle, and possibly your social status as
   473	well. Telephone billing records reveal your personal and
   474	business associations in more detail. Insurance records
   475	reveal personal and family health histories and treatments.
   476	
   477	All of this information is commonly accessed by government
   478	and private or corporate investigators.  And this list is
   479	far from exhaustive!
   480	
   481	Now consider how easily the computer networks lend
   482	themselves to even further erosions of personal privacy. The
   483	actual contents of our mail and telephone traffic have up to
   484	now been subjected to deliberate scrutiny only under
   485	extraordinary conditions. This built-in safety is due
   486	primarily to the difficulty and expense of conducting
   487	surveillance in these media, which usually requires extended
   488	human intervention. But in the medium of computer
   489	communications, most surveillance can be conducted using
   490	automated monitoring techniques. Tools currently available
   491	make it possible and even cost-effective for government and
   492	other interests to monitor virtually everything which
   493	happens here.
   494	
   495	Why would anyone want to monitor network users?  It is well
   496	documented that, throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the FBI and
   497	other agencies of government, in operations such as the
   498	infamous COINTELPRO among others, spent a great deal of time
   499	and effort collecting vast lists of names. As Computer
   500	Underground Digest moderators Jim Thomas and Gordon Meyer
   501	recalled in a recent commentary (CuD #3.42):
   502	
   503	    "A 1977 class action suit against the Michigan State
   504	    Police learned, through FOIA requests, that state and
   505	    federal agents would peruse letters to the editor of
   506	    newspapers and collect clippings of those whose politics
   507	    they did not like. These news clippings became the basis
   508	    of files on those persons that found there way into the
   509	    hands of other agencies and employers."
   510	
   511	To get onto one of these government "enemies" lists, you
   512	often needed to do nothing more than telephone an
   513	organization under surveillance, or subscribe to the "wrong"
   514	types of magazines and newspapers. Groups engaged in
   515	political activism, including environmental and women's
   516	rights organizations, were commonly infiltrated.  The sort
   517	of investigative reporting which uncovered these lists and
   518	surveillances back in the '60s and '70s is now rare, but
   519	there is little reason to assume that such activities have
   520	ceased or even slowed.  In fact, progressive computerization
   521	of local police LEIU activities (Law Enforcement
   522	Intelligence Units, commonly known as "red squads") suggests
   523	that such activities may have greatly increased.
   524	
   525	Within the realm of computer conferencing especially, there
   526	is ample reason to believe that systematic monitoring is
   527	being conducted by government and law-enforcement
   528	organizations, and perhaps by other hostile interests as
   529	well.  In a recent issue of Telecom Digest
   530	(comp.dcom.telecom), Craig Neidorf (knight@EFF.ORG) reported
   531	on the results of a recent Freedom of Information Act
   532	request for documents from the Secret Service:
   533	
   534	    " ... The documents also show that the Secret Service
   535	    established a computer database to keep track of
   536	    suspected computer hackers.  This database contains
   537	    records of names, aliases, addresses, phone numbers,
   538	    known associates, a list of activities, and various
   539	    [conference postings] associated with each individual."
   540	
   541	But the privacy issues which surround computer
   542	communications go far beyond the collection of user lists.
   543	Both government and industry have long pursued the elusive
   544	grail of personality profiling on citizens and consumers. Up
   545	to now, such ambitions have been restrained by the practical
   546	difficulty and expense of collecting and analyzing large
   547	amounts of information on large numbers of citizens.  But
   548	computer communications, more than any other technology,
   549	seems to hold out the promise that this unholy grail may
   550	finally be in sight.
   551	
   552	To coin a phrase, never has so much been known by so few
   553	about so many. The information commonly available to
   554	government and industry investi-gators today is sufficient
   555	to make reliable predictions about our personalities,
   556	health, politics, future behavior, our vulnerabilities,
   557	perhaps even about our innermost thoughts and feelings.  The
   558	privacy we all take for granted is, in fact, largely an
   559	illusion; it no longer exists in most walks of life.  If we
   560	wish to preserve even the most basic minimum of personal
   561	privacy, it seems clear that we need to take far better care
   562	on the networks than we have taken elsewhere.

   568	
   569	        Human beings are the only species with a history.
   570	        Whether they also have a future is not so obvious.
   571	        The answer will lie in the prospects for popular
   572	        movements, with firm roots among all sectors of the
   573	        population, dedicated to values that are suppressed
   574	        or driven to the margins within the existing social
   575	        and political order...
   576	                                [Noam Chomsky]
   577	
   578	
   579	In your day-to-day social interactions, as you deal with
   580	employers, clients, public officials, friends, acquaintances
   581	and total strangers, how often do you feel you can really
   582	speak freely?  How comfortable are you discussing
   583	controversial issues such as religion, taxes, politics,
   584	racism, sexuality, abortion or AIDS, for example?  Would you
   585	consider it appropriate or wise to express an honest opinion
   586	on such an issue to your boss, or a client?  To your
   587	neighbors?
   588	
   589	Most of us confine such candid discussions to certain
   590	"trusted" social contexts, such as when we are among our
   591	closest friends.  But when you post to a network conference,
   592	your boss, your clients, and your neighbors may very well
   593	read what you post -- if they are not on the nets today,
   594	they probably will be soon, as will nearly everyone.
   595	
   596	If we have to consider each post's possible impact on our
   597	social and professional reputations, on our job security and
   598	income, on our family's acceptance and safety in the
   599	community, it could be reckless indeed to express ourselves
   600	freely on the nets.  Yet conferences are often geared to
   601	controversy, and inhibitions on the free expression of
   602	opinions can reduce traffic to a trickle, killing off an
   603	important conference topic or distorting a valuable sampling
   604	of public opinion.
   605	
   606	More important still is the role computer networks are
   607	beginning to play in the free and open dissemination of news
   608	and information. Democracy is crippled if dissent and
   609	diversity in the media are compromised; yet even here in the
   610	U.S., where a "free press" is a cherished tradition, the
   611	bulk of all the media is owned by a small (and ever-
   612	shrinking) number of corporations, whose relatively narrow
   613	culture, interests and perspec-tives largely shape the
   614	public perception.
   615	
   616	Computer communication, on the other hand, is by its nature
   617	very difficult to control or shape.  Its resources are
   618	scattered; when one BBS goes bust (or is busted!), three
   619	others spring up in its place.  The natural resiliency of
   620	computer communications (and other new, decentral-ized
   621	information technologies such as fax, consumer camcorders
   622	and cheap satellite links) is giving rise to a new brand of
   623	global "guerrilla journalism" which includes everyone, and
   624	defies efforts at suppression.
   625	
   626	The power and value of this new journalistic freedom has
   627	recently shown itself during the Gulf War, and throughout
   628	Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, as well as within the
   629	U.S.  Just think of the depth and detail of information
   630	available on the nets regarding the Secret Service's recent
   631	"Operation Sundevil" and associated activities, compared to
   632	the grossly distorted, blatantly propagandistic coverage of
   633	those same activities given to the general public through
   634	the traditional media.
   635	
   636	Historically, established power and wealth have seldom been
   637	disposed to tolerate uncontrolled media, and recent events
   638	in this country and elsewhere show that computer media are
   639	sometimes seen as threats to established interests as well.
   640	To understand the role of handles in this context, it is
   641	useful to note the flurries of anti-handle sentiment which
   642	have arisen in the wake of crackdowns such as Sundevil, or
   643	the Tom Tcimpidis raid in the early 1980s.  Although few
   644	charges and fewer convictions have typically resulted from
   645	such operations, one might be tempted to speculate that the
   646	real purposes -- to terrorize the nets and chill freedoms of
   647	speech and assembly thereon -- have been achieved.
   648	
   649	In this way, sysops and moderators become unwitting
   650	accomplices in the supression of freedom on the networks.
   651	When real name requirements are instituted, anyone who fears
   652	retaliation of any sort, by any group, will have to fear
   653	participation in the nets; hence content is effectively
   654	controlled.  This consideration becomes especially important
   655	as the nets expand into even more violent and repressive
   656	countries outside the U.S.
   657	
   658	We must decide whether freedom of information and open
   659	public discussion are in fact among the goals of network
   660	conferencing, and if so, whether handles have a role in
   661	achieving these goals.  As access to the networks grows, we
   662	have a rare opportunity to frustrate the efforts of
   663	governments and corporations to control the public mind!  In
   664	this way above all others, computers may have the potential
   665	to shape the future of all mankind for the better.

   670	                      ----------------
   671	
   672	
   673	       The move to electronic communication may be a turning
   674	       point that history will remember.  Just as in
   675	       seventeenth and eighteenth century Great Britain and
   676	       America a few tracts and acts set precedents for
   677	       print by which we live today, so what we think and do
   678	       today may frame the information system for a
   679	       substantial period in the future.
   680	        [Ithiel de Sola Pool, "Technologies of Freedom", 1983]
   681	
   682	
   683	There was a time when anybody with some gear and a few
   684	batteries could become a radio broadcaster -- no license
   685	required.  There was a time when anyone with a sense of
   686	adventure could buy a plane, and maybe get a contract to
   687	carry mail.  Those early technological pioneers were
   688	probably unable to imagine the world as it is today, but
   689	their influence is strongly felt in current laws,
   690	regulations and policies with roots in the traditions and
   691	philosophies they founded and shaped.
   692	
   693	Today the new pioneers are knitting the world together with
   694	computers, and the world is changing faster than ever.  Law
   695	and ethics are scrambling to keep up.  How far will this
   696	growth take us?  No one can say for sure.  But you don't
   697	need a crystal ball to see that computer communications has
   698	the potential to encompass and surpass all the functionality
   699	of prior media -- print, post, telegraph, telephone, radio
   700	and television -- and more.  It seems reasonable to assume
   701	that computer communications will be at least as ubiquitous
   702	and important in the lives of our grandchildren as all the
   703	older media have been in ours.
   704	
   705	It will be a world whose outlines we can now make out only
   706	dimly.  But the foundations of that world are being built
   707	today by those of us exploring and homesteading on the
   708	electronic frontier.  We need to look hard at what it will
   709	take to survive in the information age.
   710	
   711	In this article we have attempted to show, for one very
   712	narrow issue, what some of the stakes may be in this future-
   713	building game.  But the risks associated with exposing your
   714	name in a computer conference are not well defined, and
   715	various people will no doubt assess the importance of these
   716	risks differently.  After all, most of us take risks every
   717	day which are probably greater than the risks associated
   718	with conferencing. We drive on the expressway.  We eat
   719	sushi.  To some people, the risks of conferencing may seem
   720	terrifying; to others, insignificant.
   721	
   722	But let us not get side-tracked into unresolvable arguments
   723	on the matter.  The real issue here is not how dangerous
   724	conferencing may or may not be; it is whether you and I will
   725	be able to make our own decisions, and protect ourselves (or
   726	not) as we see fit.  The obvious answer is that users must
   727	exercise their collective power to advance their own
   728	interests, and to pressure sysops and moderators to become
   729	more sensitive to user concerns.
   730	
   731	To help in that effort, we would like to recommend the
   732	following guidelines for user action:
   733	
   734	    --  Bear in mind John Perry Barlow's observation that
   735	        "Liberties are preserved by using them".  Let your
   736	        sysop know that you would prefer to be using a
   737	        handle, and use one wherever you can.
   738	
   739	    --  Try to support boards and conferences which allow
   740	        handles, and avoid those which don't.
   741	
   742	    --  When using a handle, BEHAVE RESPONSIBLY!  There will
   743	        always be irresponsible users on the nets, and they
   744	        will always use handles.  It is important for the
   745	        rest of us to fight common anti-handle prejudices by
   746	        showing that handles are NOT always the mark of an
   747	        irresponsible user!
   748	
   749	    --  Educate others about the importance of handles (but
   750	        NEVER argue or flame anyone about it).
   751	
   752	To sysops and moderators: We ask you to bear in mind that
   753	authority is often used best where it is used least.  Grant
   754	users the right to engage in any harmless and responsible
   755	behaviors they choose.  Protect your interests in ways which
   756	tread as lightly as possible upon the interests of others.
   757	The liberties you preserve may be your own!
   758	
   759	In building the computer forums of today, we are building
   760	the social fabric of tomorrow.  If we wish to preserve the
   761	free and open atmosphere which has made computer networking
   762	a powerful force, while at the same time taking care against
   763	the risks inherent in such a force, handles seem to be a
   764	remarkably harmless, entertaining and effective tool to help
   765	us.  Let's not throw that tool away.
