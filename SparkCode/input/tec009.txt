    17	  TITLE:
    18	      STACKER and disk-cache programs.
    19	
    20	  OVERVIEW:
    21	      While STACKER includes its own cache, the driver is compatible with other
    22	      products that perform the same function.
    23	
    24	      Norton's NCACHE and Microsoft WINDOWS' SMARTDRV.SYS are loaded from the
    25	      CONFIG.SYS, usually before STACKER.  Other programs, such as PC-KWIK and
    26	      PC-CACHE, load from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, after STACKER.
    27	
    28	  ISSUES/COMMENTS:
    29	      1) Some cache programs (e.g., PC-CACHE, PC-KWIK) may report that a
    30	      particular drive letter is not eligible for caching, but caching proceeds
    31	      normally.
    32	
    33	      2) When multiple cache programs are operating, disk reads/writes may have
    34	      unpredictable results.  Use of memory may also be negatively impacted.
    35	
    36	
    37	  RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
    38	      1) Alter the settings for the cache so that the uncompressed, host drive
    39	      is cached.  This will, by extension, cache any STACKER volumes residing
    40	      on it.  (The PC-KWIK message can be avoided by excluding the STACKER
    41	      volume when the cache program is invoked.  Consult PC-KWIK documentation
    42	      for the appropriate parameter.)
    43	
    44	      2) If a commercial cache program is running, specify a STACKER cache of 0
    45	      bytes (/M=0)
