     1	Atlanta, GA (February 3, 1992)- VisiSoft's new systems architecture for its
     2	Windows-based VisiNet Network Management System will be shown for the
     3	first time at NetWorld Boston. The new architecture includes the
     4	Enterprise System Platform and special Function Modules that tailor the
     5	system to a wide range of network operating systems, protocols, devices,
     6	enterprise managers and management functions.
     7	
     8	"It's clear that better network management is critical to the continued
     9	expansion of the use of LANs and WANs," said Rich Mauro, VisiSoft's vice
    10	president, marketing. "The requirements, however, vary considerably from
    11	company to company. A single LAN user's management needs are quite
    12	different from those of the heterogenous, multi-site, wide area network
    13	user. Many of these single site networks will, of course, grow in
    14	complexity over time.
    15	
    16	The primary design goal of VisiNet's new architecture was to allow users to
    17	tailor a VisiNet system to their initial requirements and expand it as
    18	they grow."
    19	
    20	Under the new VisiNet architecture, users may purchase the basic Enterprise
    21	System Platform with a single module supporting one specific environment.
    22	NetWare, LAN Manager/LAN Server, NetBIOS and SNMP Function Modules will
    23	all be available when the new platform ships. The Function Modules will
    24	provide the same user interface and function as the current versions of
    25	VisiNet that support these network operating systems and protocols. A
    26	Banyan VINES Module will also be available later in the year; Banyan
    27	users, however, may take immediate advantage of VisiNet's management
    28	capabilities by using the SNMP Module. VisiSoft is also working with
    29	Novell to interface VisiNet's Netware Module to Novell's recently
    30	announced network management platform.
    31	
    32	Companies whose heterogenous, wide-area networks employing multiple network
    33	operating systems and protocols can purchase VisiNet's Enterprise System
    34	Platform with multiple Function Modules to serve their specific needs.
    35	Administration of the entire network environment may then be done from a
    36	single network console.
    37	
    38	"VisiNet's new structure will minimize the impact of network expansion on
    39	network management," said Chip Standifer, VisiSoft's president. "The
    40	modular approach will not only let users expand VisiNet as their network
    41	expands, but do it painlessly. They won't have to buy a new system or
    42	upgrade to a new version...they'll just add the necessary module to
    43	VisiNet's Enterprise System Platform".
    44	
    45	Later this year, VisiSoft will introduce additional Function Modules that
    46	will allow VisiNet to operate as a hierarchical network management system.
    47	VisiNet consoles equipped with a Communicating Module in remote sites will
    48	send real-time management information to a central site equipped with a
    49	VisiNet Collecting Module. Users will have a choice of managing the remote
    50	sites solely from the central console or sharing the management duties
    51	between the remote and central site.
    52	
    53	Future VisiNet Function Modules will expand its interface to other vendors'
    54	enterprise management systems, such as NetView, and to proprietary device
    55	information. Device support will be developed in joint development efforts
    56	with these vendors or by the vendors themselves. VisiSoft will make
    57	information on the VisiNet interface available to interested vendors to
    58	facilitate the expansion process.
    59	
    60	"Our goal," said Standifer, "is to evolve VisiNet to the point where it not
    61	only detects problems, but resolves many common network problems.
    62	Effective network management requires both monitoring and control. We want
    63	VisiNet to help the network administrator understand the options and
    64	select the best course of action. We expect to make those expanded
    65	functions available as additional modules that companies can add to their
    66	systems."
    67	
    68	VisiSoft distributes VisiNet through a worldwide network of value-added
    69	resellers, system integrators and distributors. Inquiries are welcome, and
    70	should be directed to VisiSoft, 430 10th St., NW, Suite S-008, Atlanta, GA
    71	30318, phone 404-874-0428, fax 404-8746412.

    73	--------------------------------------------------------
    74	
    75	Atlanta, GA (February 3, 1992)- The Simple Network Management Protocol
    76	(SNMP) version of VisiNet, the Windows-based active network management
    77	system developed by the VisiSoft division of Technology Dynamics, began
    78	shipping today. "VisiNet's SNMP version," said Chip Standifer, VisiSoft's
    79	president, "lets network administrators manage systems and devices that
    80	include an SNMP agent. It supports MIB I and MIB II, and can be
    81	user-expanded to support experimental and enterprise-specific MIBs. It
    82	communicates with the network using NetManage's TCP/IP kernel, which is
    83	included in the VisiNet SNMP package."
    84	
    85	VisiNet's user-extendable capability allows it to access any information
    86	provided by a system's or device's SNMP agent. VisiSoft plans to augment
    87	this basic user definability with pre-configured MIBs beyond MIB I and MIB
    88	II. These will support the RMON MIB and other popular system or device
    89	MIBs.
    90	
    91	Currently operating under Windows 3.0, VisiNet will operate under Windows
    92	3.1 and OS/2 2.0 when these environments become available. VisiNet's SNMP
    93	version has a suggested list price of $2495. The LAN Manager/LAN Server
    94	and NetWare versions, which are currently available, are priced at $1995.
    95	VisiSoft distributes VisiNet through a worldwide network of value-added
    96	resellers, system integrators and distributors.

   100	Atlanta, GA (February 3, 1992)- VisiNet 2.0, developed by the VisiSoft
   101	division of Technology Dynamics, promises to revolutionize PC-based
   102	network management with its graphic presentation and control of network
   103	information. Currently operating under Windows 3.0, VisiNet will operate
   104	under Windows 3.1 and OS/2 2.0 when those environments become available.
   105	Under any of these environments, it provides a graphical user interface
   106	and user-definable icons which allow users to create hierarchical views of
   107	each network layer. Real-time monitoring alerts the user to critical
   108	operating conditions and alarm events. World, country, state and regional
   109	maps or office floor plans may be selected as backgrounds for each view;
   110	custom images created in bit-map or DXF format may also be imported.
   111	VisiNet's database supports the creation and maintenance of up data fields
   112	and list boxes for objects within each node and link. Standard definition
   113	templates, which can later be tailored to specific network needs, help
   114	users get off to a fast start.
   115	
   116	A comprehensive scripting language that lets users define what is monitored
   117	and what conditions will cause an alarm is a key VisiNet feature. The
   118	language was designed with ease of use as a primary objective, but
   119	standard scripts are provided for initial use and customization, allowing
   120	gradual familiarization with the language.
   121	
   122	Because it polls the network constantly, VisiNet sends an alert immediately
   123	when it detects a potential problem. This can be a visible and audible
   124	signal; the user can then respond to the alert, clicking down to view the
   125	cause of the alarm or change in state.
   126	
   127	The polling interval may be selected for each item within each object,
   128	allowing further fine-tuning of network performance. VisiNet builds a
   129	database of activity while it monitors the network. It maintains a
   130	historical log, from which trouble tickets and standard reports may be
   131	pulled for network analysis. Data may also be exported to any application
   132	supporting Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) or Object Linking and Embedding
   133	(OLE) for analysis or additional activity reports.
   134	
   135	At setup, VisiNet automatically scans the network and identifies each
   136	active node and its configuration. Among the items VisiNet monitors are
   137	processor type, memory capacity, LAN adapters, device drivers and the
   138	values of environment variables. By adding the links and any other
   139	required workstation data, the user can be up and running quickly. Each
   140	time a user signs on, the station's hardware configuration is
   141	automatically scanned, allowing VisiNet to maintain a constantly updated
   142	network configuration.
   143	
   144	VisiSoft shipped its LAN Manager/LAN Server version in August, 1991 and its
   145	NetWare version in November, 1991. Each of these products are priced at
   146	$1995. VisiNet's SNMP version is priced at $2495.
   147	
   148	VisiSoft distributes VisiNet through a worldwide network of value-added
   149	resellers, system integrators and distributors. Inquiries are welcome, and
   150	should be directed to VisiSoft, 430 10th St., NW, Suite S-008, Atlanta, GA
