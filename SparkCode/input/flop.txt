     2	                   USING DOUBLESPACE ON FLOPPY DISKS
     3	          
     4	          There are a few things you should know before you use
     5	          DoubleSpace on floppy disks.
     6	          
     7	          1.   You can't use DoubleSpace unless you have installed it on
     8	               your computer. 
     9	          
    10	          2.   The floppy disk needs to have at least .65 Megabytes
    11	               (665K) of free space.  This means you cannot use 360K,
    12	               5¬" diskettes.  Change to the appropriate drive, and use
    13	               the CHKDSK command to check the capacity of a diskette. 
    14	               
    15	          3.   If you plan to share data with someone else, they will not
    16	               be able to read a DoubleSpaced diskette unless they are
    17	               using DoubleSpace on their computer.
    18	          
    19	          4.   Before you can use a DoubleSpaced diskette, you will need
    20	               to MOUNT it.  This is not as painful as it sounds.
    21	          
    22	          5.   DOS will create a new drive where it will store information
    23	               about this compressed floppy disk.  It does this in the same
    24	               fashion as it did when compressing a hard drive.  
    25	          
    26	          
    27	                    COMPRESSING A FLOPPY DISK
    28	          
    29	          Make sure you read items 1-4 above.  Then, to compress a floppy
    30	          disk, do the following:
    31	          
    32	          1.   Place a formatted floppy disk in the drive of your choice.
    33	          
    34	          2.   If you want to compress a diskette in your A drive, type
    35	               the following:
    36	          
    37	                         dblspace /compress a: <ENTER>
    38	          
    39	               A shortcut for the DBLSPACE /COMPRESS A: command
    40	               is:
    41	                    
    42	                         dblspace /com a: <ENTER>
    43	          
    44	               Change to the newly DoubleSpaced floppy:
    45	          
    46	                         a: <ENTER>
    47	          
    48	               Then type:
    49	          
    50	                         dblspace /info <ENTER> 
    51	          
    52	                A shortcut for the DBLSPACE /INFO command is:
    53	          
    54	                         dblspace /i <ENTER>
    55	          
    56	          If you restart your computer or change floppy diskettes, you will
    57	          need to MOUNT the floppy disk before it can be used.
    58
