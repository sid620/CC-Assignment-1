    17	  TITLE:
    18	      Removing a STACKER volume completely; down/upsizing a drive.
    19	
    20	  OVERVIEW:
    21	      STACKER's SREMOVE utility is used in the process of both permanently
    22	      removing a STACKER volume and "changing" the size of either the STACKER
    23	      volume or the uncompressed drive.
    24	
    25	  ISSUES/COMMENTS:
    26	      1) The permanent removal of a STACKER volume entails the removal of all
    27	      of the data inside of it.
    28	
    29	      2) At this time, it is not possible to increase the size of a STACKER
    30	      volume.  It is necessary to remove the volume completely, then to create
    31	      another volume of a different size.  This applies if the STACKER
    32	      volume is too small (too much space left uncompressed when the STACKER 	
    33	      volume was created).  Stacker version 2.0 can reduce the size of the
    34	      Stacker drive using SDEFRAG /G (page 94 in the User Guide).
    35	
    36	  RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
    37	      1) Permanent removal:
    38	          a) back up all data on STACKER volume;
    39	          b) run SREMOVE (see User's Manual, "STACKER Utilities--SREMOVE");
    40	          c) delete DEVICE=STACKER.COM... and DEVICE=SSWAP.COM.. lines in
    41	          CONFIG.SYS, per instructions following SREMOVE..
    42	
    43	      2) "Changing" the size of a STACKER volume:
    44	          a) proceed as for permanent removal;
    45	          b) make another free space STACKER volume using INSTALL or SCREATE,
    46	          and changing only the amount of space to leave uncompressed;
    47	          c) restore data to the new STACKER volume;
    48	          d) edit CONFIG.SYS for new STACVOL filename.
