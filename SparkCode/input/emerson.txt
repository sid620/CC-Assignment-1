     1	BOSTON, MA, February 11, 1992 -- In a joint program with Novell, Inc.,
     2	Emerson Computer Power is demonstrating its comprehensive new AccuMon
     3	Power Surveillance Software at NetWorld, which opened here today.
     4	
     5	The new AccuMon surveillance software is being shown in parallel
     6	demonstrations in both the Emerson (#1511) and Novell booths (#3322 and
     7	#2310). AccuMon provides a new, high level of reporting capabilities for
     8	monitoring the status of a computer's uninterruptible power systems (UPS)
     9	with Novell's new NetWare 3.11 Network Management Architecture --
    10	including integration of power status data on LANs and WANs. It features
    11	highly interactive graphic displays for at-a-glance comprehension of power
    12	activity and assists with power scheduling for energy conservation and
    13	equipment protection.
    14	
    15	When used with the new Novell architecture, AccuMon gives a network
    16	administrator full UPS control and monitoring capabilities from any node
    17	or position in the network or from a remote console. Until now these
    18	functions could be performed only on a console or dedicated file server.
    19	
    20	A Novell Professional Developer, Emerson is one of the first to develop and
    21	market NetWare Aware UPS software. The program resides on a Novell file
    22	server and executes as a background task to perform UPS monitoring and
    23	shutdown. AccuMon is executed as an Novell Loadable Module (NLM) for
    24	NetWare 3.11.
    25	
    26	With its new AccuMon software, Emerson provides three cross-platform levels
    27	of support to satisfy the needs of virtually any PC or workstation network
    28	administrator:
    29	
    30	* for DOS local UPS monitor and control
    31	
    32	* for UNIX remote UPS monitor and control
    33	
    34	* and for Novell NetWare Management Agent Architecture. Cross extensibility
    35	is provided among all three platforms and Emerson products, including its
    36	AccuPower GOLD series of on-line UPSs and future products. As a result,
    37	Emerson UPS power protection systems can grow in parallel with a user's
    38	computer and network configurations, according to Adam Stolinski, Emerson
    39	director of product management.
    40	
    41	"Emerson is the first major UPS manufacturer to offer an integrated family
    42	of software solutions for all power monitor and control application
    43	requirements, including status reporting in Novell's NetWare 3.11
    44	Management Agent environment," Stolinski said.
    45	
    46	"The basic AccuMon package will give standalone DOS PC users the ability to
    47	monitor and control the operation of the Emerson UPS that backs up their
    48	system," Stolinski explained. "A 'control screen' can be viewed on the
    49	monitor to check the status of the UPS's input/output voltage,
    50	temperature, battery charge, etc. The software also allows the storing of
    51	UPS status and events data on disk for evaluation and reporting
    52	purposes."
    53	
    54	The information can be displayed in either of two ways. When viewed on a
    55	graphics based workstation in a DOS environment, the display depicts the
    56	flow of electricity through the system with an intuitive graphic that's
    57	unique to the Emerson UPS software. On a console in a Novell environment,
    58	the display conforms to other Novell screens, with more of the information
    59	communicated textually. Network administrators can switch between the
    60	two.
    61	
    62	AccuMon is also the only UPS software to offer a power scheduling feature.
    63	It allows the system administrator to direct the UPS to turn itself off
    64	and to repower at pre-selected times for energy and equipment savings.
    65	Using it, the system could be automatically powered down at night or over
    66	weekends. It can also be used to shut down all communications coming into
    67	a facility while back-ups are underway.
    68	
    69	"The data gathering and logging capability is available in DOS and
    70	UNIX-based versions for standalone PCs, workstations and hosts, and in
    71	Novell-based versions for network file servers and nodes," Stolinski
    72	continued.
    73	
    74	In addition, he noted, Emerson is currently marketing LAN/UNIX Shutdown
    75	Interface Kits that reside on the server/host to monitor UPS status. Upon
    76	loss of AC power, the software sends a one-line "AC POWER OUT" message to
    77	all nodes in the network so users can prepare for a potential shutdown.
    78	When the UPS reaches a "LOW BATTERY" condition, the network software
    79	gracefully shuts down the server/host. When AC utility power is restored,
    80	the server/host can be restored to operation and all nodes can resume
    81	activity. The software also stores all activity messages in an error log
    82	on the server/host for evaluation and reporting purposes.
    83	
    84	"The newest members of the AccuMon family let the UPS interact as an
    85	intelligent member of the network, with a remote interface to it,"
    86	Stolinski said. "It allows the Novell network manager to communicate
    87	remotely with UPS equipment across multiple network environments and
    88	platforms, using Novell's forthcoming NetView host terminal. Ultimately,
    89	AccuMon will work hand in hand with NetWare 3.11 management functions to
    90	provide complete monitoring and control of all UPS systems supporting all
    91	network devices, such as file servers, nodes, bridges, routers, gateways,
    92	hub concentrators and even printers.
    93	
    94	"Network managers will thus be able to check UPS status locally or remotely
    95	and turn on or off devices connected to any UPS," he continued. "They will
    96	be able to perform load shedding to extend the battery backup time to ride
    97	out power losses. This means, for example, that a LAN manager could
    98	remotely control any network computer to halt print queue operations,
    99	suspend external communications activities, prohibit new user log-ons or
   100	even shut down the entire operating system, as needed."
   101	
   102	The AccuMon Novell software modules use the UPS communications port and the
   103	serial port on any 386 file server. An Emerson NLM software module
   104	provides access to the NetWare Management Agent software on the server,
   105	which passes UPS status data via NetWare 3.11 to the NetWare Management
   106	Console. The Novell "network navigator" window will let users click on
   107	part of a screen map to view any segment of network operations -- from
   108	analyzing traffic to power status to distributing software remotely.
   109	
   110	"Emerson Computer Power, a Novell Professional Developer, is proud to have
   111	been selected as an initial provider of this 'NetWare Aware' UPS monitor
   112	and control software for use with Novell's most powerful network
   113	management system," Stolinski commented.
   114	
   115	Emerson's AccuMon Novell module has been co-developed with John Matze, a
   116	well-known developer of Novell NLM and VAP products, who is currently
   117	working with Novell in developing standards for UPS monitoring in Novell's
   118	Network Management Software. It is immediately available and is priced at
   119	$149.
   120	
   121	Emerson Computer Power is the world's largest manufacturer of power
   122	protection systems for computing applications ranging from single user PCs
   123	and local area networks to minicomputers and mainframe systems. The
   124	company has major manufacturing centers in Ohio, California, Mexico,
   125	England, Malaysia and Italy.
