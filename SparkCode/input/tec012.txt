     9	Stacker is compatible with Digital Research Dos versions 5.0 and 6.0.
    10	However, there are some special considerations when using these
    11	operating systems.
    12	
    13	DR DOS 6:
    14	1. DR DOS 6 comes with its own file compression program.  This
    15	compression program cannot be used if you choose to use Stacker.  Using
    16	Stacker will give you better speed, better compression, a smaller
    17	driver size, and more advanced features than the compression program
    18	that comes with DR DOS .
    19	
    20	2. Installing DR DOS 6 after Stacker is installed may require a special
    21	procedure.  See Tech023 for details.
    22	
    23	DR DOS 5 and 6:
    24	     
    25	Using DR DOS 5 or 6, if you configure Stacker to use EMS for its cache,
    26	or if you load the Stacker device driver into upper memory, the
    27	following message is displayed by the Stacker device driver when you
    28	start your computer:
    29	
    30	        "Note: In DR DOS, loading Stacker high (or using /EMS)
    31	         may slow disk access.  Please see the Stacker README
    32	         file for help."
    33	
    34	This condition can be remedied using the /ND parameter on the
    35	STACKER.COM device line in Config.sys.  Use the /ND parameter if your
    36	hard disk controller is NOT a bus-master controller.  (If you are
    37	unsure of  whether your disk controller is a bus-master, it probably
    38	isn't.) If you DO use a bus-master disk controller and it does not
    39	support virtual DMA, DO NOT use the /ND switch to increase disk
    40	performance.
    41	
    42	If you do not use the /ND parameter and wish to suppress the warning
    43	message, place the /NW (no warning) parameter on the Stacker DEVICE
    44	statement in the CONFIG.SYS file.
    45	
    46	DR DOS 5:
    47	Under DR DOS 5,  the SSWAP option does not operate properly with
    48	Stacker versions 1.0-1.11.  It recommended that you upgrade to version
    49	1.12 or 2.0 in order to SSWAP the Stacker drives.
