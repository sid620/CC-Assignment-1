     1	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ

     3	Always start a program with a batch file containing [exit] as the first line.
     4	This is important if you! Let's say you already have shelled to dos from
     5	windows, dmp or another program. Running two big shells on top of eachother
     6	really fuck up your memory, and usually requires a reboot. Replace win.exe
     7	with win.bat and move win.com to winfile.com, and dmp.exe with play.bat and
     8	dmpfile.exe, just as an example.... | The bat files is to contain lines:
     9	1 - exit	2-[program].[extension]
    10	
    11	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    12	
    13	If you have 4dos, you can create aliases that replace the programs. Like:
    14	
    15	win=exit^win
    16	
    17	, etc.......
    18	
    19	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
    20	
    21	Your path statement should NOT exceed 127 bytes. Remember that  "path="
    22	is a part of that environment string.
    23	
    24	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
    25	
    26	If you ever need to turn a variable to UPPER CASE, save the path, set the
    27	path=[the variable], which will make it uppercase, set the original
    28	variable=[path], and restore the path... This might look like this:
    29	
    30	set oldpath=%path%
    31	set path=%a%
    32	set %a=%path%
    33	set path=oldpath
    34	
    35	This requires a lot of environment free, depending on you system-configuration.
    36	
    37	Suggestions to improvements: Use disk instead of environment to store
    38	temporary data.
    39	
    40	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
    41	
    42	A very simple trick to expand the current path, is to set the path like this:
    43	
    44	set path=%path%;[the new directory you want temporarily in your path]
    45	
    46	Don't say you wasn't warned! VERY simple!
    47	
    48	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
    49	
    50	if you like to have a lot of REM statements in your batch files, use this
    51	instead:
    52	
    53	When you normally-
    54	
    55		rem blahblahblahblablahblahblah
    56		rem blahblahblahblablahblahblah
    57		rem blahblahblahblablahblahblah
    58		rem blahblahblahblablahblahblah
    59	
    60	replace it with,
    61	
    62		goto a
    63		rem blahblah........
    64		:a
    65	
    66	Which is faster, but not really noticeable on todays fast computers
    67	Dos really don't know that it's handling a REM line until it has processed
    68	and read the whole line!
    69	
    70	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
    71	
    72	To prevent programs from messing up your autoexec.bat, as a first and only
    73	line in autoexec.bat, start a new batch file, called, for example,
    74	autosub.bat. This file would contain your originally autoexec.bat, and
    75	this way, you can select what lines you want to include.
    76	
    77	You might also try to set the read only attribute of the config.sys and
    78	autoexec.bat files. Not so good solution, but......?
    79	
    80	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    81	
    82	With 4dos you would start the autosub.bat with a CALL autosub.bat.
    83	With command.com, i dunno, try c:\autosub.bat as a first line...
    84	
    85	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
    86	
    87	again, a tip for slow computer, or really, slow text subsystems:
    88	In the beginning of your config.sys, put a:
    89	
    90	ctty nul
    91	
    92	which sends all output to the NUL: device
    93	and then in the end:
    94	
    95	ctty con
    96	
    97	which restores input from the kbd....
    98	
    99	Remember that you can't really press ctrl-break during process
   100	since you haven't restored the keyb-control, and a ctrl+c will stop
   101	processing and deny any further processing...
   102	
   103	The NUL device is an empty device that points to nothing. This might be useful
   104	if a program refuses to let you NOT save a file. Type NUL: or NUL as filename,
   105	and you will never see the file again!
   106	
   107	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
   108	
   109	There is an undocumented config.sys feature called "Comment".
   110	Use it like this:
   111	
   112	Comment=[text]
   113	
   114	Dos only captures the first to letters of the text, and COMMENT is not
   115	case-sensitive. After comment, dos ignores all lines that begins with
   116	the same two letters as the first two letters of [text] was. Let's say you
   117	don't want any drivers installed, you specify:
   118	
   119	Comment=De
   120	
   121	,which in turn makes dos NOT install any DEvices.
   122	
   123	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
   124	
   125	I found two other undocumented config.sys features. One of which I know the
   126	meaning of. (See it for yourself, just list io.sys.) The features is:
   127	
   128	INSTALLHIGH
   129	MULTITRACK
   130	
   131	Installhigh is like devicehigh and loadhigh, but it INSTALLs high, just like
   132	dvh and lh. (Installing is for starting exe/com files from config.sys that
   133	are not really needed for installing here...)
   134	
   135	Multitrack...
   136	I dunno what this is, but I will investigate it further, and get back to you.
   137	If you know what this is, please contact me.
   138	
   139	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
   140	
   141	Sometimes the order of fcbs, stacks, files, etc... DO COUNT!!!
   142	
   143	You might run into some RARE problems when the order of these
   144	"names" is in a certain order. It occoured to me that it was this way, when I
   145	suddenly had problems when the machine locked up whenever I used the internal
   146	"copy" !!! I had to rem out every line in autoexec.bat (really autosub.bat),
   147	and then every line in config.sys, until I suddenly found out that the
   148	order DO COUNT!
   149	
   150	Generally, I put it in this order (at the absolute beginning of config.sys):
   151	
   152	files
   153	buffers
   154	fcbs
   155	lastdrive
   156	stacks
   157	
   158	That works ok for me.
   159	
   160	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
   161	
   162	Set verify=on when using non-standard devices in dos.
   163	This helps you PKUNZIP (and arj, lha...) and copy from, for example,
   164	84track 21sec/track disks. You might think that this isn't a problem, and
   165	it is very rare indeed... ,But it happens, and the extra time dos uses with
   166	disk sector verifying is really worth it.
   167	
   168	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
   169	
   170	Set break=on to be able to break more often.
   171	
   172	Everyone needs a break sometimes....... =*)
   173	
   174	The extra speed gained in dos by setting break=off, isn't THAT much, and
   175	when you set break=on, you can break unwanted processes faster, which makes
   176	dos sessions go faster.
   177	
   178	Have you ever COPYed files to the wrong destination? When break=on, dos checks
   179	for ctrl+c even when handling disk operations, so you can break relatively
   180	fast, and recover faster...
   181	
   182	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
   183	
   184	Do you need to know if to files is different?
   185	As far as I know, fc or comp don't leave errorlevels, BUT there is a
   186	solution!
   187	
   188	Try this:
   189	
   190	attrib -rsh .\nomatch
   191	del .\nomatch
   192	fc %file1% %file2% > .\nomatch
   193	if exist .\nomatch echo There was a difference!
   194	
   195	Nice, eh? Not? =*)
   196	
   197	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
   198	
   199	Want to copy disks faster? You COULD check which clusters were occupied, etc..
   200	BUT if you aren't so keen on writing anything else than bat-files, just copy
   201	ALL files on you floppy (/S /H) to a temporary directory on your hd, copy
   202	labels (with LC.btm). Then MOVE them out again to disk, and you are done!
   203	
   204	No empty clusters copyed!
   205	
   206	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
