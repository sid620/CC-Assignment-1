    68	Windows will be supported.
    69	
    70	"Our customers and dealers have asked us to provide them a LAN version of
    71	CO/Session for controlling PCs and modems across the network. CO/Session
    72	LAN II does that with Windows and ACS support and at a great price,"
    73	states Jim Mulholland, Triton's Director of Marketing.
    74	
    75	Offering the ability to access modems connected to an ACS, CO/Session LAN
    76	II is ideal for use with high speed modems to access remote PCs and
    77	networks. With TTY, VT100 or VT102 terminal emulation modes and XMODEM
    78	file transfer protocol, CO/Session LAN II also provides network users with
    79	general purpose communications.
    80	
    81	"Originally developed to be compatible with asynchronous communication
    82	servers, Co/Session LAN II has grown into a full fledged network aware
    83	communication program, able to control other workstations on the network
    84	and access modems connected to an ACS for remote control, terminal
    85	emulation or file transfers," explained Jim Mulholland. "It provides
    86	network administrators with one package to handle many needs with one
    87	common user interface and terrific value."
    88	
    89	CO/Session LAN II is compatible with asynchronous communication servers
    90	(ACS) that support a NASI/NCSI or Interrupt 14 interface. Communication
    91	servers supported include Triton's CO/Session ACS, Novell's NACS,
    92	Telebit's PACS, J & L Information System's NCS, Network Products' ACS2,
    93	Cross Information's LAN+Modem and Fresh Technologies' Modem Assist.
    94	CO/Session LAN II is licensed for use with up to four modems
    95	simultaneously with a single ACS.
    96	
    97	Support of Banyan's Intelligent Communication Adapters (ICA) is also
    98	included with CO/Session LAN II. This provides Banyan users with a
    99	powerful capability for control of remote LANs and PCs. No other remote
   100	control package currently is compatible with Banyan's ICA.
   101	
   102	The suggested list price of CO/Session LAN II is $195 per file server with
   103	unlimited users for LAN-to-LAN remote control and for a single
   104	communication server with up to four communication devices (modems).

   108	
   109	"CO/Session LAN II is the only LAN remote control product to retail for
   110	less than $200 for a file server. Competing products retail for $295 -
   111	$795 and many are licensed by number of workstations on the LAN creating a
   112	real headache for Administrators to maintain proper licensing", states Jim
   113	Mulholland.
