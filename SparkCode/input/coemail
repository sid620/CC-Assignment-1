     2	Electronic Mail on Company Computer Systems

    10	I.    Introduction
    11	
    12	The Electronic Mail Association has requested the preparation of this
    13	White Paper as a means of helping companies to decide what policies
    14	they would adopt with respect to access to and use and disclosure of
    15	electronic mail sent and received by their employees on company
    16	electronic mail systems.
    17	
    18	There is no single, simple answer to the policy questions relating to
    19	company electronic mail privacy.  Appropriate company policy will
    20	differ depending on the needs of the company, the reasonable
    21	expectations of employees, the rights of outsiders, and a balancing of
    22	various complex interests.  The only policy that can vigorously
    23	endorsed for virtually all circumstances is this:
    24	
    25	        A company should have a policy with regard to protection of
    26	        its employees' privacy and it should tell employees what that
    27	        policy is.
    28	
    29	        Most employers should establish privacy policies that deal
    30	        with all media of communication used by employees, rather than
    31	        singling out electronic mail as if it posed some unique threat
    32	        to employee privacy.
    33	
    34	The rise of electronic mail as an increasingly popular means of doing
    35	business presents all companies using this new medium with an
    36	opportunity to think through employee privacy protection in general
    37	and with a fresh view.  While electronic mail has a few novel features
    38	that raise new issues, the basic principles involved in selecting a
    39	company privacy policy are not new. electronic mail may, infact, be
    40	more private than many more traditional means of communication or than
    41	paper files.  And we are certain that enlightened companies will
    42	consider the impact on employee morale of respecting reasonable
    43	privacy interests, as well as an employer's undoubted right to gain
    44	access to the messages sent on its behalf by its employee agents.
    45	
    46	In order to facilitate a company's review of the issues and selection
    47	of a policy, we have outlined in this White Paper some of the key
    48	background issues, various alternative policies that might be adopted,
    49	and various criteria and procedures that could be used to evaluate and
    50	implement a policy that strikes an appropriate balance.
    51	
    52	II.    Background
    53	
    54	Many different people have a stake in the establishment of a
    55	reasonable policy governing access to and disclosure of company
    56	electronic mail.  The employer must ultimately control the use of its
    57	computer resources and must have access to its own business records,
    58	of course, but it also has a stake in establishing a secure workplace
    59	and an environment that respects employee rights.  Employees want some
    60	privacy but they also want the employer to be able to cope with
    61	business matters in their absence.  Third parties may have rights to
    62	access certain company records and to have some types of
    63	communications protected. Law enforcement officials may have certain
    64	needs for access and for certainty regarding who can give consent for
    65	access.  Everyone using an electronic mail system has a stake in
    66	maintaining its security, preserving its operational status, and
    67	preventing its use for illegal purposes.
    68	
    69	Few legal principles set forth mandatory minimum baselines for either
    70	protection of employee privacy or for guaranteed access to company
    71	records by outsiders.  The Electronic Communications Privacy Act,
    72	passed in 1986, was designed primarily to deal with the privacy of
    73	communications sent over systems used by the public (and with the
    74	threat of unauthorized access by outsiders). The Act does not address
    75	in detail the status of messages sent by employees on behalf of their
    76	employer -- at least with regard to key questions such as whether the
    77	employer can insist that the employee consent to access and disclosure
    78	by the employer.  Some states may guarantee minimum privacy rights
    79	but, what expectations of privacy are reasonable in the workplace is
    80	neither clear nor in general mandated by law.  The one principle most
    81	likely to gain consensus and legal support is that employers should
    82	not misrepresent their policies -- and have an affirmative obligation
    83	to disclose what those policies are.
    84	
    85	Electronic mail is not the only medium of communication that raises
    86	privacy questions.  But it does provide a good opportunity to think
    87	through the extent to which an employee may reasonably expect that
    88	access to files and messages by other employees of the employer should
    89	be constrained in various ways. Electronic mail is somewhat more
    90	permanent in nature than a conversation over the phone or in the
    91	hallway.  It is less formal than written memoranda.  It may be sent to
    92	groups of people and may he readily forwarded to others.  It may stay
    93	around in storage for a long time, even after the recipient has
    94	indicated a desire to delete it.  It may include as attachments
    95	documents that form a critical part of an employer's business.  Or it
    96	may constitute a clearly private message that does not even concern
    97	the employer's interests.
    98	
    99	The most complex policy issues posed by electronic mail concern
   100	whether an employee pursuing company business has a right to expect
   101	the company to obtain the employee's consent before accessing or
   102	disclosing the contents of company files that are normally under that
   103	employee's control.  The separate question whether employees have the
   104	right to use company electronic mail systems to send personal
   105	messages, and to expect that such messages will not intentionally be
   106	accessed by the employer, is a somewhat different question -- more
   107	akin to the question whether an employer has the right to restrict the
   108	making of private phone calls, or to inspect all employees purses (and
   109	somewhat easier to answer in any given context).  Employees may not
   110	leave all expectations of privacy behind when they go to work.  But
   111	the communications they make on behalf of their employer are clearly
   112	subject to certain requirements that simply do not apply to personal
   113	phone conversations undertaken from home.
   114	
   115	The resulting balancing act can be constrained in useful ways.
   116	Particular sets of policies can be articulated for different work
   117	environments, depending on the relative intensity of the employer's
   118	need for access to (or to make disclosure of) the information, the
   119	extent of any invasion of reasonable expectations of privacy on the
   120	part of the employee, the degree to which either employer or employee
   121	could have satisfied its needs by less intrusive (or less demanding)
   122	means, and the degree to which close questions are thought
   123	appropriately to be called in one direction or another or to be
   124	resolved by special procedures.  The basic criteria for evaluating any
   125	given policy are, at a general level, quite general and
   126	straightforward.
   127	
   128	        Does the policy comply with law and with duties to third parties?
   129	
   130	        Does the policy unnecessarily compromise the interests of the
   131	        employee, the employer or third parties?
   132	
   133	        Is the policy workable as a practical matter and likely to be
   134	        enforced?
   135	
   136	        Does the policy deal appropriately with all different forms of
   137	        communications and record keeping within the office?
   138	
   139	        Has the policy been announced in advance and agreed to by all
   140	        concerned?
   141	
   142	III.  Policy Options
   143	
   144	If a company does choose to articulate an express policy on the
   145	privacy of company electronic mail, then it may want specific elements
   146	of such a policy to address particular issues.  These include:
   147	
   148	A. What are the permissible uses to which the company electronic mail
   149	system mad be put, and by whom?
   150	
   151	    1.  May the company electronic mail system be used incidentally
   152	    for personal messages?
   153	
   154	    2.  If so, must employees take special steps to protect such
   155	    messages against inadvertent inspection by others?
   156	
   157	B. Will the company monitor the contents or transactional records of
   158	electronic mail as a matter of course, for any particular purposes?
   159	
   160	    1.  If so, will the company refrain from further inspection of
   161	    messages it determines are of a personal and private nature?
   162	
   163	    2.  Will the nature of any routine monitoring be disclosed to
   164	    employees?
   165	
   166	    3.  Will the company limit the use to which it may put information
   167	    that is available only from electronic monitoring?
   168	
   169	C. What grounds will be required to be shown, if any, to justify
   170	obtaining access to the contents of electronic mail without the
   171	consent of a sender or recipient?
   172	
   173	    1.  Must the employee seeking access establish a valid business
   174	    purpose for such access?
   175	
   176	    2.  Will the company weigh the importance of the business purpose
   177	    against the strength of any reasonable expectation of privacy?
   178	
   179	    3.  Will the company consider the extent to which the information
   180	    could be obtained by alternative, less intrusive means?
   181	
   182	    4.  Will the company consider whether the employee could have
   183	    taken steps to secure the privacy of personal matters?
   184	
   185	    5.  How, and by whom, will close cases be decided?
   186	
   187	D.  On what basis, if any, will the company defer to requests by
   188	senders of electronic mail that the contents not be disclosed to
   189	parties other than the intended recipient?
   190	
   191	    1.  Will the company attempt to respect an objection to disclosure
   192	    from the sender of the message based on a claim that disclosure
   193	    will result in personal embarrassment?
   194	
   195	    2.  Will the company attempt to respect an objection to disclosure
   196	    from the sender of the message based on a claim that the
   197	    disclosure would result in invasion of a privacy right?
   198	
   199	E. Will the company impose any limitations on the internal uses to
   200	which the contents of mail, or the results of transaction monitoring,
   201	may be put?
   202	
   203	    1.  Will the company policy provide that the contents of
   204	    electronic mail messages should be disclosed to others within the
   205	    company, without the consent of a sender or recipient, only to the
   206	    extent necessary to serve an important business purpose?
   207	
   208	    2.  Will company policy provide that employees should not be
   209	    disciplined or terminated on the basis solely of information
   210	    obtained from monitoring or inspection of company electronic mail
   211	    files.
   212	
   213	F. Will any special restrictions or limitations apply to disclosure of
   214	the contents of electronic mail to law enforcement officials?
   215	
   216	    1.  Does the company reserve the right to disclose electronic mail
   217	    files sent to, received by or relating to an employee to law
   218	    enforcement officials, without the consent of the employee and
   219	    without giving prior notice to the employee?
   220	
   221	    2.  Should the company policy provide that prior notice will be
   222	    given to the employees involved, before disclosure of company
   223	    electronic mail to law enforcement authorities, unless prior
   224	    disclosure is prohibited by law or the company concludes that its
   225	    security or property would be placed at risk by such disclosure.
   226	
   227	G. Will any special procedural requirements or approvals be required
   228	prior to access or disclosure in any particular kinds of cases?
   229	
   230	    1.  Should a special committee review in advance any requests for
   231	    authority to access electronic mail files without the consent of
   232	    the employee.
   233	
   234	    2.  Should a specified person have authority to approve external
   235	    disclosures of electronic mail without the consent of a sender or
   236	    recipient.
   237	
   238	On any of these issues, it is possible to articulate a range of
   239	different possible policies that impose greater or lesser burdens on
   240	decisions to access or disclose the contents of electronic mail.  More
   241	detailed additional materials designed to help a company review
   242	alternative policies and select a combination of policies most
   243	suitable to its own needs and the expectations of its employees will
   244	be forthcoming from the Association.
   245	
   246	IV.  Conclusion
   247	
   248	Employers have an interest in minimizing confusion and disputes
   249	regarding the handling of company records, including the handling of
   250	communications that might involve some expectation of privacy on the
   251	part of employees.  The Electronic Mail Association has performed a
   252	significant service in seeking to articulate the various interests
   253	involved and to formulate alternative policies and the criteria by
   254	which such policies may be evaluated.
