     1	Table of Errors:
     2	
     3	Most of these will prevent the Harddisk from working correctly under DOS, so
     4	it's not likely that you ever get these errors.
     5	
     6	Invalid Rootsector Signature
     7	  The last two bytes of the rootsector must be 55 AA (hex)
     8	More than one bootable Partition
     9	  In the partition table there should only be one partition marked bootable
    10	  You can override this message with the -omb switch
    11	Invalid bootable-flag
    12	  The bootable flag in the partition table should be 80h or 0
    13	  You can override this message with the -obf switch
    14	Invalid Start Sector
    15	  The start sector number of the partition is either 0 or greater than
    16	  the number of sectors per track
    17	Invalid End Sector
    18	  The end sector number of the partition is either 0 or greater than
    19	  the number of sectors per track
    20	Invalid Start Head
    21	  The number of the start head of the partition is greater than the total
    22	  number of heads of the drive - 1
    23	Invalid End Head
    24	  The number of the end head of the partition is greater than the total
    25	  number of heads of the drive - 1
    26	Partition Table Corrupt - start
    27	  The start sector (head/cylinder/sector) does not match the absolute start
    28	  sector
    29	Partition Table Corrupt - end
    30	  The end sector (head/cylinder/sector) does not match the absolute start
    31	  sector + the number of sectors
    32	Overlapping Partitions
    33	  The partition table contains overlapping partitions
    34	Invalid Jump Instruction in Bootsector
    35	  The first three bytes of the bootsector must be a 3-byte jump (E9 xx xx)
    36	  or a 2-byte jump (EB xx 90). Perhaps the partition is not yet formatted.
    37	  FIPS can only split DOS-formatted partitions.
    38	Invalid Bootsector
    39	  The last two bytes of the bootsector must be 55 AA (hex)
    40	Can't handle number of Bytes per Sector
    41	  The number of bytes per sector must be 512
    42	Number of Sectors per Cluster must be a power of 2
    43	  Only 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128 are allowed
    44	Partition must have 2 FATs
    45	  Every DOS partition has 2 copies of the FAT
    46	Number of Rootdir entries must be multiple of 16
    47	  One sector of the rootdirectory contains 16 entries
    48	  You can override this message with the -ore switch
    49	Number of Rootdir entries must not be zero
    50	  Sounds reasonable, doesn't it?
    51	Wrong Media Descriptor Byte in Bootsector
    52	  The Media Descriptor Byte in the Bootsector should be F8 (hex)
    53	  You can override this message with the -omd switch
    54	FAT too large
    55	  FAT has more than 256 sectors - useless, since 2 bytes * 64K entries =
    56	  128K = 256 * 512 bytes. If you can access the drive, do not attempt to
    57	  change this.
    58	  You can override this message with the -olf switch
    59	FAT too small
    60	  The partition has more clusters than the FAT can handle
    61	  You can override this message with the -osf switch
    62	Number of hidden sectors incorrect
    63	  The number of hidden sectors in the bootsector must match the number
    64	  of the start sector in the partition table
    65	12-bit FAT not supported
    66	  FIPS can't split partitions with a 12-bit FAT
    67	Number of sectors (short) must be zero
    68	  For partitions with more than 65536 sectors (BIGDOS) the number of sectors
    69	  (short) must be zero
    70	Number of sectors (short) does not match Partition Info
    71	  The number of sectors in the partition table must match the number of
    72	  sectors in the bootsector
    73	Number of Sectors (long) does not match Partition Info  
    74	  The number of sectors in the partition table must match the number of
    75	  sectors in the bootsector
    76	
    77	Invalid Drive number
    78	  Only the numbers 128 - 255 are valid drive numbers
    79	Invalid Partition number
    80	  Only the numbers 1 - 4 are valid partition numbers
    81	
    82	Error reading FAT 1
    83	  Read error - bad sector
    84	Error reading FAT 2
    85	  Read error - bad sector
    86	
    87	FAT copies differ
    88	  The two copies of the FAT differ - use CHKDSK
    89	Wrong Media Descriptor Byte in FAT
    90	  The first byte of each FAT is the Media Descriptor - it should be F8h
    91	  You can override this message with the -omd switch
    92	New Partition not empty
    93	  The New Partition must be completely empty
    94	
    95	Too many drives found
    96	  FIPS can handle up to 9 drives - that should be enough for most PCs :-)
    97	No Compatible Harddisk found
    98	  Hey, where is your drive? Perhaps your Harddisk is not int 13h compatible.
    99	No valid partition found
   100	  All partitions in the partition table are empty
   101	No free partition
   102	  All four partitions are in use
   103	
   104	Error reading Drive Geometry
   105	  Interrupt 13h 08h returned an error code
   106	Drive Initialization Failure
   107	  Interrupt 13h 00h returned an error code
   108	Error reading Root Sector
   109	  Read error - bad sector, wrong drive number or incompatible harddrive
   110	Can't split extended Partitions
   111	  FIPS can not yet split extended DOS partitions
   112	Invalid Partition selected
   113	  The partition selected with the -p switch is empty
   114	Unknown Filesystem
   115	  Only DOS partitions can be split (System Indicator Byte must be 4 or 6)
   116	Error reading Boot Sector
   117	  Read error - bad sector
   118	Partition too small - can't split
   119	  If the partition has only slightly more than 4085 clusters, it can't be
   120	  split any further without rewriting the FAT to 12 bit.
   121	Last Cylinder is not free
   122	  Since the new partition is created at the end of the old one and
   123	  contains at least one cylinder, the partition can not be split if
   124	  not at least the very last cylinder is completely free.
   125	  Probably there is a hidden file like 'image.idx' or 'mirorsav.fil'
   126	  in the last cylinder - see the doc.
   127	Invalid new start cylinder
   128	  The start cylinder chosen with the -c switch is not valid
   129	Error writing Root Sector
   130	  Write error - perhaps the disk is write protected?
   131	Error writing Boot Sector
   132	  Write error :-( - this will hopefully never happen ...
   133	
   134	Too many save files on disk
   135	  There can only be ten save files on one floppy disk (rootboot.000 to
   136	  rootboot.009). Delete some or use another floppy disk.
   137	Can't open file
   138	  FIPS tried to write the file rootboot.00? to drive A: but an error occured
   139	  Try using another floppy disk
   140	Error writing file
   141	  FIPS tried to write the file rootboot.00? to drive A: but an error occured
   142	  Try using another floppy disk
   143	Error closing file
   144	  FIPS tried to write the file rootboot.00? to drive A: but an error occured
   145	  Try using another floppy disk
   146	
   147	
   148	Warnings:
   149	
   150	These will not cause FIPS to exit, since they are not really errors. If you
   151	have the possibility to correct the problem, do it; if not, this will not
   152	affect DOS, so you should be safe.
   153	
   154	Invalid Partition entry
   155	  The partition entry contains data, but the system indicator is 0 (empty).
   156	  Attention: FIPS will possibly overwrite this entry. Make sure this is no
   157	  valid Partition (temporarily disabled etc.)
   158	Partition does not end on Cylinder boundary
   159	  All partitions should end on a cylinder boundary
   160	Partition does not begin on Cylinder boundary
   161	  Normally, all partitions except the first one should begin on head 0,
   162	  sector 1 of a cylinder. This is not required by DOS, however.
   163	Free Space between Partitions
   164	  There is free space on the harddisk that is not covered by a partition
   165	Number of reserved sectors should be 1
   166	  The bootsector uses only 1 sector, so the number of reserved sector
   167	  is usually 1. If you can access your drive, do not attempt to change this.
   168	Sectors per track incorrect
   169	  The number of sectors per track in the bootsector does not match the actual
   170	  drive geometry reported by the BIOS
   171	Number of drive heads incorrect
   172	  The number of drive heads in the bootsector does not match the actual
   173	  drive geometry reported by the BIOS
   174	Wrong System Indicator Byte
   175	  For BIGDOS Partitions the System Indicator Byte should be 6; for DOS16
   176	  Partitions it should be 4
   177	Wrong Signature
   178	  Partitions with 32-bit sector numbers (since DOS 4.0+) have an 'extended
   179	  Bios Parameter Block' in the bootsector, its signature byte is 29h. This
   180	  is however totally ignored by DOS.
   181	Drive number in bootsector does not match actual drivenumber
   182	  The drive number in the bootsector does not match the drive number by which
   183	  the drive is accessed
   184	Wrong FAT entries 1 & 2
   185	  A 16-bit FAT should start with F8 FF FF FF
   186	Can't open debugfile
   187	  The debugfile is created in the current directory - make sure it is
   188	  writable
   189
