     1	                 GENERAL COMPATIBILITY ISSUES WITH WINDOWS 3.1
     2	
     3	The introduction of a new operating environment often changes the interaction
     4	between applications or utilities and the new environment.  The Windows 3.1
     5	introduction is no exception.
     6	
     7	The new Windows 3.1 has some minor compatibility problems with some Central
     8	Point programs that were released prior to the release of Windows 3.1.  This
     9	document addresses several of the main issues, such as:
    10	
    11	1.    Windows 3.1 has changed its font handling, and the Windows TSR Manager
    12	and Scheduler programs in PC Tools may exhibit changed fonts as a result.  Both
    13	products work correctly otherwise; alerts and scheduled alarms will appear as
    14	scheduled.
    15	
    16	2.    Using PC-Cache with the /WIN parameter in Windows' Standard Mode can
    17	cause a PC-Cache memory error.  Removing the /WIN parameter will alleviate the
    18	problem.  Most Windows users will be running in Enhanced Mode; no configuration
    19	change is required to PC-Cache for Enhanced Mode users.
    20	
    21	3.    Central Point Backup Version 7.1 (which ships as both a standalone
    22	product and as a part of PC Tools 7.1) installs a floppy device driver,
    23	VFD.386, in the SYSTEM.INI file.  At installation, Windows 3.1 changes that
    24	driver to its own (called VFD - no 386); as a result, CP Backup will display
    25	an error message indicating that VFD.386 was not found.  Changing the line in
    26	SYSTEM.INI that states "DEVICE=*VFD" to "DEVICE=VFD.386" will allow CP Backup
    27	to run normally.
    28	
    29	Central Point Backup, Version 7.2, which is currently shipping, uses a
    30	different device driver, CPBVXD.386, which Windows 3.1 does not remove at
    31	installation.
    32	
    33	Future Central Point Software products will automatically configure the
    34	software to work correctly with Windows 3.1.
    35	
    36	NOTE:  Much of the information contained herein is based on problems found or
    37	reported with Windows 3.1 BETA code.  This document will be revised as needed
    38	to reflect updates or additions to any of this information.
    39	
    40	
    41	              INSTALLING WINDOWS 3.1 WITH VSAFE/VDEFEND RESIDENT
    42	
    43	Programs:  VSAFE, VDEFEND           Versions:  7.0, 7.1
    44	
    45	SITUATION: 
    46	Win 3.1 Setup does not run properly when virus detection programs are memory
    47	resident.
    48	
    49	CAUSE:
    50	Virus detection programs are designed to monitor file integrity and to alert
    51	the user if a file is about to be changed.  During the installation of a new
    52	program, new files are written to the hard drive and existing files are
    53	changed, triggering this warning feature.
    54	
    55	SOLUTION:
    56	Disable VSafe/VDefend for the duration of the installation procedure.  VSafe
    57	may remain in resident memory, but Option 3 (general write protect), Option 8
    58	(write protect executables) and especially Option 4 (check executable files)
    59	should be disabled.  Option 4 triggers the warning messages.  Press Alt-V at
    60	the DOS prompt, while VSafe is resident, to disable these options.
    61	
    62	After Windows Setup has been completed, but before launching Windows for the
    63	first time, run CPAV to update all CHKLIST.CPS files on the drive.
    64	
    65	Alternatively, delete the CHKLIST.CPS files in all Windows directories using
    66	PC Shell or File Find.
    67	
    68	
    69	                   VSAFE RESIDENT WHILE RUNNING WINDOWS 3.1
    70	
    71	Programs:  VSAFE                    Versions:  1.0, 1.1, 1.2
    72	
    73	SITUATION:
    74	Problems running Windows 3.1 while VSafe is resident.
    75	
    76	CAUSE:
    77	Windows uses the hard drive for memory swapping, which means that files are
    78	frequently written to during normal operation.
    79	
    80	WORKAROUND:
    81	Disable Option 3 (general write protect).  Option 8 (protect executables) can
    82	also be disabled if WNTSRMAN is issuing too many messages advising that various
    83	Windows executables (.EXE, .COM, .DLL, etc.) are being changed.  To temporarily
    84	change VSafe Options, press Alt-V at the DOS prompt while VSafe is resident. 
    85	To make these changes permanent, change the VSAFE parameters in the CONFIG.SYS
    86	or AUTOEXEC.BAT to "/1+ /4+ /5+ /6+".  All other options should be off.
    87	
    88	WNTSRMAN must be loaded so that the proper messages concerning potential virus
    89	infections will reach the user through Windows.
    90	
    91	
    92	               WINDOWS 3.1 SETUP FAILS DUE TO LACK OF DISK SPACE
    93	
    94	Programs:  DATAMON                  Versions:  7.0, 7.1
    95	
    96	SITUATION:
    97	Setup fails due to insufficient disk space.  A DIR command, typed at the DOS
    98	prompt, shows that there should be plenty of space available.  Data Monitors
    99	SENTRY is loaded.
   100	
   101	POSSIBLE CAUSE:
   102	Data Monitor is unable to determine that extra disk space is required so old
   103	Sentry files will not be purged.
   104	
   105	SOLUTION:
   106	Use the Purge command in the File menu of Undelete to purge as many Delete
   107	Sentry files as necessary to free up the required space.
   108	
   109	If PC Shell or some other method is used to delete the files, unload Datamon
   110	first or Delete Sentry will capture the deletions in the Delete Sentry
   111	directory and no additional disk space will be made available.
   112	
   113	NOTES:  *.GRP can be added to Delete Sentry's file exclusions list, since many
   114	of these files are created and deleted during Windows Setup.
   115	
   116	
   117	                   WINDOWS 3.1, SMARTDRIVE AND DATA MONITOR
   118	
   119	Programs:  DATAMON                  Versions:  7.0, 7.1
   120	
   121	The Windows Help file suggests loading SmartDrive AFTER Data Monitor, which is
   122	contrary to our advice concerning PC-Cache and Data Monitor, and claims that
   123	there may be problems if SmartDrive is loaded BEFORE Datamon.
   124	
   125	Loading SmartDrive before Datamon should not cause any problems.  We have not
   126	been able to recreate any problems, nor have we received any problem reports
   127	from PC Tools users.  This may change after we have had an opportunity to
   128	perform more extensive testing.
   129	
   130	
   131	                            PC-CACHE AND SMARTDRIVE
   132	
   133	Programs:  PC-CACHE                 Versions:  7.0, 7.1
   134	
   135	Windows documentation states that both PC-Cache and SmartDrive should not be
   136	run resident at the same time, which is certainly correct.  It is unwise to run
   137	two cache programs simultaneously under any conditions.
   138	
   139	There are no performance benchmarks running PC-Cache against SmartDrive 4.0,
   140	and therefore no definitive statement can be made about which cache performs
   141	better.  We have no reason to believe that data loss situations are likely to
   142	occur due to the use of PC-Cache with Windows 3.1.
   143	
   144	
   145	             PC-CACHE GIVES MEMORY ERROR ON EXIT FROM WINDOWS 3.1
   146	
   147	Programs:  PC-CACHE                 Versions:  7.0, 7.1
   148	
   149	SITUATION:
   150	PC-Cache gives the error "PC-Cache memory error, reboot!" when Windows 3.1 is
   151	exited.
   152	
   153	CAUSE:
   154	This error will occur when PC-CACHE /WIN is used AND Windows 3.1 is run in
   155	Standard Mode.
   156	
   157	SOLUTION:
   158	Remove the /WIN parameter (which tells PC-Cache to free up memory for Windows)
   159	when running Windows in Standard mode.  If the primary environment is Windows,
   160	reduce the size of the cache.  Either of these options will eliminate the error
   161	condition.
   162	
   163	
   164	                       WINDOWS 3.1 AND PCT 7.0 GRAPHICS
   165	
   166	Programs:  PCTOOLS                  Versions:  7.0
   167	
   168	The Windows README.WR1 file warns of possible graphics problems when returning
   169	to an application from PC Tools programs while in Windows Standard mode.  This
   170	is true of PC Tools V7.0 but was corrected with V7.1.
   171	
   172	Select Text Mode in PC Config/Display to correct the problem in V7.0.
   173	
   174	
   175	                    WINDOWS 3.1 WITH CP BACKUP V7.0 OR V7.1
   176	
   177	Programs:  WNBACKUP                 Versions:  7.0, 7.1
   178	
   179	To run CP Backup/Win 7.0 or 7.1 under Windows 3.1, substitute "device=VFD.386"
   180	for the "device=*vfd" driver in the [386enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file. 
   181	This is consistent with what is required for Windows 3.0.  If the user is not
   182	comfortable with editing the SYSTEM.INI, reinstall CP Backup and the Install
   183	program will automatically make this change to the SYSTEM.INI file and will
   184	change "device=*vdmad" to "device=vdmad.386" as well.  If there are problems
   185	with floppy drives after the installation is complete, this last line should
   186	be returned to the default "device=*vdmad".
   187	
   188	CP Backup/Win V7.1 will not save the Include/Exclude list correctly under
   189	Windows 3.1.  As a result, the default settings and setup files may not select
   190	files correctly.  The following alternate methods are available:
   191	
   192	1.    Upgrade to CP Backup V7.2, which is optimized for Windows 3.1
   193	
   194	2.    Create, modify, and save setup files in CP Backup/DOS.  The setup can be
   195	used in CP Backup/Win under Windows 3.1, but should not be saved in CP
   196	Backup/Win or the Include/Exclude list will be lost.
   197	
   198	3.    Edit the WNBACKUP.INI or *.SET files with any text editor.  This is the
   199	only way to change the default Include/Exclude settings for CP Backup/Win.
   200	
   201	      The Include/Exclude list begins with [INEX0] for line 1; [INEX1] for line
   202	2, and so on.  A maximum of 16 lines are allowed.  After editing the desired
   203	file specifications, save as a text file.  All upper case letters are required
   204	for file specifications in the Include/Exclude list.
   205	
   206	4.    Files will be selected if the "Save File Selections" is checked when the
   207	setup is saved, but this will not save the Include/Exclude list.
   208	
   209	There may be some font display problems and screen anomalies that do not affect
   210	the functionality of the program.
   211	
   212	
   213	                            WINDOWS 3.1 AND DESKTOP
   214	
   215	Programs:  DESKTOP                  Versions:  6.0, 7.0, 7.1
   216	
   217	The Windows 3.1 SETUP.TXT file refers to problems running Desktop in Windows
   218	from anything other than a .PIF file (DOS window, etc.).  Because we have not
   219	been able to duplicate problems in-house, we suspect that this reference is
   220	related to known problems between SwapDT and Windows.  Following is one such
   221	scenario:
   222	
   223	1.    SwapDT is resident before entering Windows;
   224	
   225	2.    Run Desktop in any fashion from within Windows;
   226	
   227	3.    Use the hotkey sequence to exit (instead of ESC or Exit from the main
   228	menu);
   229	
   230	4.    The system may lock, the computer may reboot: something unusual happens;
   231	
   232	5.    The system may lock on exit from Windows.
   233	
   234	If problems are encountered running Desktop from other than a .PIF, try
   235	unloading SwapDT.
   236	
   237	
   238	                          WINDOWS 3.1 LOCKS ON ENTRY
   239	
   240	Programs:  VSAFE                    Versions:  1.0, 1.1, 1.2
   241	
   242	SITUATION:
   243	Windows will lock with the Windows 3.1 logo on the screen, or just prior to
   244	that point.
   245	
   246	POSSIBLE CAUSE:
   247	Check for VSafe loaded after SMARTDRV.EXE in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  Another
   248	cause may be that the CHKLIST.CPS in the Windows directory file was not
   249	updated.
   250	
   251	SOLUTION:
   252	1.    Load VSafe before SmartDrive in the AUTOEXEC.BAT or the CONFIG.SYS; OR
   253	
   254	2.    Update the CHKLIST.CPS file in the Windows directory;
   255	
   256	      a.    Delete the original file and run CPAV to create a new file; OR
   257	
   258	      b.    Run CPAV and select Update Checklist files.
   259	
   260	      c.    Run CPAV and select Delete All Checklist files.  Then scan the
   261	      entire drive to create new checklist files.
   262	
   263	
   264	                   DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CP BACKUP V7.1 & V7.2
   265	
   266	Programs:  WNBACKUP                 Versions:  7.1, 7.2
   267	
   268	QUESTION:
   269	What are the differences between CP Backup for Windows V7.1 and V7.2?  What
   270	does V7.2 have that V7.1 doesn't?
   271	
   272	ANSWER:
   273	CP Backup V7.2 is optimized for Windows 3.1 and is intended as an upgrade for
   274	those who upgrade to Windows 3.1.  Specifically:
   275	
   276	1.    It provides support for Windows 3.1 "Drag and Drop" function;
   277	
   278	2.    It has slightly different fonts, buttons, and screen displays that are
   279	more consistent with Windows 3.1 standards;
   280	
   281	3.    It handles the Enhanced mode drivers more effectively:
   282	
   283	      a.    Setup leaves (or returns to) the default drivers DEVICE=*VFD and
   284	      DEVICE=*VDMAD;
   285	
   286	      b.    V7.1 uses VFD.386 in place of *VFD.  V7.2 uses a unique driver,
   287	      CPBVXD.386;
   288	
   289	      c.    V7.2 does not modify the *VDMAD driver at all as the enhancements
   290	      are already in Windows 3.1 driver.
   291	
   292	CP Backup/Win V7.2 also:
   293	
   294	1.    Adds the "Select files for ..." button to make displaying the tree/file
   295	list and selecting files to Backup/Compare/Restore easier;
   296	
   297	2.    Corrects a V7.1/Windows 3.1 compatibility problem where the
   298	Include/Exclude list will be blanked and no files will be selected if a setup
   299	file is saved or selections are saved as the default.
   300	
   301	Those who upgrade to Windows 3.1 and use Central Point Backup for Windows
   302	should upgrade to CP Backup/Win V7.2 to take advantage of the new features and
   303	for the Windows 3.1 problems that have been corrected in V7.2.  Note that there
   304	is no additional drive tape support with V7.2.
   305	
   306	CP Backup/Win 7.1 will work with Windows 3.1 for the most part.  The biggest
   307	drawback is that it will not save the Include/Exclude Files correctly under
   308	Windows 3.1, so files will not be selected correctly with any setup files
   309	created or modified under Windows 3.1.
   310	
   311	
   312	                      GENERAL WINDOWS 3.0 TROUBLESHOOTING
   313	                        (Not verified for Windows 3.1)
   314	
   315	INSTALLATION
   316	
   317	Trouble shooting tips for PC Tools programs are included in the "Getting
   318	Started/Tips for Windows" manual.
   319	
   320	1.    Disable autoswitching/autosensing on video card if applicable.
   321	
   322	2.    Disable ROM shadowing if applicable.
   323	
   324	3.    Boot clean to eliminate TSR's and unnecessary drivers.
   325	
   326	4.    Remove old Windows drivers or other OEM setup drivers.
   327	
   328	5.    Update outdated BIOS.
   329	
   330	6.    Check for IRQ conflicts such as a bus mouse on IRQ 3 with a printer on
   331	COM2.
   332	
   333	
   334	UNRECOVERABLE APPLICATION ERRORS (UAE'S)
   335	
   336	NOTE:  Error is GENERAL PROTECTION FAULT in V3.1
   337	
   338	1.    GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
   339	
   340	      This generally indicates that some part of the application has mapped to
   341	an area of memory not allocated to it or allocated to something else.  The
   342	Windows environment may be very unstable at this point.  Exit and reboot the
   343	system.  UAE's will only occur with Windows and Windows Applications.  This is
   344	equivalent to the error message VIOLATED SYSTEM INTEGRITY, which will occur
   345	only with Non-Windows Applications.  The same procedure should be followed for
   346	the condition that causes both error messages.
   347	
   348	2.    GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING:
   349	
   350	      a.    HIMEM.SYS may not be addressing the system memory correctly, and
   351	      adding a "/machine" parameter may be required.  Refer to Windows or DOS
   352	      README.TXT for more information on machine parameters.
   353	
   354	      b.    Check the accuracy of hardware selections made during Windows
   355	      setup.  Run "Setup" from the command line in the Windows directory.
   356	
   357	      c.    If installed with APPEND or SUBST statements in AUTOEXEC.BAT, or
   358	      with incompatible memory drivers in CONFIG.SYS, installation may be
   359	      corrupt.
   360	
   361	      d.    Check for incorrect DOS version.  Windows V3.x requires at least
   362	      MS DOS 3.1.  When applicable, the correct OEM DOS must be used on the
   363	      machine.  For example, use Compaq DOS on Compaq machines.
   364	
   365	      e.    Check for applications that were written for a previous version of
   366	      Windows.
   367	
   368	      f.    UAE's may be product specific, based on code written for that
   369	      particular application.  Check with the product manufacturer.
   370	
   371	      g.    Confirm the following minimum configuration:
   372	
   373	            CONFIG.SYS:
   374	
   375	            files=60
   376	            buffers=30 (if running SMARTDRIVE =10)
   377	            shell=c:\command.com /p /e:2048
   378	            device=c:windows\himem.sys
   379	
   380	      h.    For testing purposes, substitute Windows standard drivers for
   381	      drivers supplied by a specific manufacturer.
   382	
   383	
   384	UNABLE TO GO INTO ENHANCED MODE:
   385	
   386	1.    First determine if it is possible to go into Standard mode (WIN/S).  If
   387	not, make sure there is 1 "full" MB of extended memory available.  Check the
   388	extended memory manager (such as HIMEM.SYS) or other drivers or TSRs that may
   389	be loading in CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT.
   390	
   391	2.    Refer to steps #1 through #6 under INSTALLATION in this document.  Check
   392	as many as are applicable to the system.

   394	3.    There may be a conflict in the Upper Memory area (between 640 and 1024k)
   395	as Windows attempts to establish page frames where other device drivers, such
   396	as network, video, ROM BIOS, etc., are located.  The easiest way to determine
   397	if this is the problem is to exclude the entire range by adding a statement to
   398	the SYSTEM.INI file, [386enh] section, EMMEXCLUDE=A000-EFFF.  If this is the
   399	problem, then a diagnostics program, such as Quarterdecks' Manifest, will
   400	determine where the conflict is occurring.  The EMMEXCLUDE statement can be
   401	modified to encompass only that specific address range.  For testing purposes,
   402	load a standard memory manager such as HIMEM.SYS.
   403	
   404	4.    If on an IDE or SCSI hard drive, it may be necessary to add
   405	VIRTUALHDIRQ=OFF to the SYSTEM.INI file, [386enh] section.
   406	
   407	5.    If unable to go into Standard mode, make sure there is 256k of extended
   408	memory available and an extended memory manager.  If unable to go into Real
   409	mode, check the hardware setup.  Refer to #1 below.
   410	
   411	
   412	OTHER TROUBLESHOOTING:
   413	
   414	In general, if other erratic behavior occurs, such as dropping to a DOS prompt,
   415	system locks, etc., try as many of the following as applicable:
   416	
   417	1.    Disable any non-essential hardware or swap it out with other hardware for
   418	testing purposes.  Contact the hardware manufacturer if necessary.
   419	
   420	2.    Check system BIOS, video BIOS or keyboard BIOS for the most up to date
   421	version.  Call the manufacturer if necessary.
   422	
   423	3.    For non-FDISK, 3rd party disk partitions, it may be necessary to add the
   424	following to the SYSTEM.INI file [386enh] section:
   425	
   426	      VIRTUALHDIRQ=OFF
   427	
   428	      This statement may be needed for IDE and SCSI drives.  It may be
   429	necessary to disable SMARTDRIVE for drives with more than 1024 cylinders.
   430	
   431	4.    Boot clean to eliminate TSRs and unnecessary drivers.
   432	
   433	5.    Substitute Windows standard drivers for testing purposes.
   434	
   435	6.    Check for file fragmentation, lost clusters, etc.
   436	
   437	7.    Make sure there is sufficient free disk space; 2 to 4mb depending on the
   438	machine and the Windows Application being used.
