     1	                  ATARI ST Guaranteed Cheat Codes and Strategies:
     2	                                 Compiled by KTH
     3	
     4	This is a collection of cheats and codes taken from seven seperate text files
     5	from the sewer disk collections.  I have merged them together, removed all
     6	redundancies and trivial hints, removed all AMIGA ONLY hints, and alphabetized
     7	them.  All of these hints have been tested, and have also removed all those
     8	hints where they are either built into our broken versions, or are unnecessary
     9	due to a 'cheat mode' put into the game by the crackers.

    12	***ARKANOID II: REVENGE OF DOH***
    13	When all your lives are lost and the title screen is desplayed, hit the CAPS
    14	LOCK and type MAGENTA. Now when you start a new game, press 's' to open up the
    15	gates either side of the screen so you can progress to the next...But even more
    16	useful is this: loose all your lives and return to the title screen, hit CAPS
    17	LOCK and then type MAGENTA again, only this time type in DALEY88 to take you
    18	right to the last screen.
    19	
    20	
    21	***BAAL***: the coordinates of all the jetpack platforms, in the order you
    22	should go to them to finish the game. X/Y, X being width and Y being height:
    23	Level 1: 31/16 (cartridge 2), 02/25, 52/30 (cartridge 3), 51/00, 24/38, 62/13,
    24	         02/50, 64/49, 33/58 (exit to level 2).
    25	Level 2: 34/30, 54/12 (cartridge 4), 16/12, 00/24, 03/34, 30/47, 54/12 (exit to
    26	         level 3).
    27	The jetpack isn't used on level 3.
    28	
    29	
    30	***BARBARIAN II***: step-by-step walk-thru:
    31	Level 1: left, left, right seven times, left, right, left, in the cave, and    
    32	         right. 
    33	Level 2: right, up, left, up, left, left, right, left three times, up, and     
    34	         left.
    35	Level 3: up, right, right, up, left, right, up, right, left, left, up, left,   
    36	         left, up, up, right, right, left, left, up.
    37	Level 4: hit the fireballs, then try to leap across. Several low chops will
    38	destroy it. Next is the Pit Demon; when he reaches out, use an overhead chop to
    39	hit his arms; repeat until death. Next, Drax himself! Wait until he pauses
    40	between spells, and hit him with a flying head chop! The End...

    91	On the next life, shoot the alien and fall into the water on the right just
    92	before reaching the first ramp. On your next life, shoot the green alien, jump
    93	over the ramp and stay in the right-hand lane. If all has gone well, you should
    94	be shot by a bubble like alien, and you should have-finally-activated the
    95	infinite lives mode.  
    96	
    97	      
    98	***ENDURO RACER***
    99	When you first begin to play Enduro Racer, after the countdown type the word
   100	CHEAT in on the keyboard. Having typed that in, pressing one of the following

   109	
   110	
   111	***FERNANDEZ MUST DIE***: pause the game,type SPINYNORMAN, to get infinite
   112	                          lives!
   113	
   114	
   115	***FLYING SHARK*** (Unverified)
   116	When you score high enough to make the high score table, type HSC or KDJ
   117	(holding down the 5 key as you enter the last letter) <May not be necessary>.
   118	HSC gives infinite lives
   119	KDJ gives invulnerability        
   120	
   121	
   122	***GAUNTLET II***  You need 2 keys and 2 locked treasure chests. As you open
   123	the first chest, hold down the Help key, collect the treasure. Open the second
   124	chest while holding down Insert. An Ankh will appear and you must collect it.
   125	You'll hear a gong. You should now have 50,000 health points and 32,000
   126	reflective super-shots. The shots will vanish once you leave the level, and if
   127	you pick up an amulet, the counter will be reset to 10 shots.

   138	
   139	***IKARI WARRIORS***
   140	Type in FREERIDE on the high score table and you'll start the next game with an
   141	invisible soldier.
   142	
   143	
   144	***INTERNATIONAL KARATE +***
   145	Codes to type in while playing- 
   146	FREZ                     Freeze the game
   147	PAC                      Pacman moves across screen
   148	FISH                     Makes a fish leap out of water

   150	PERI                     periscope rises out of water
   151	Also, typing FUCK and CUNT results in an interesting message.
   152	
   153	
   154	***LEATHERNECK***
   155	Start the game and type 'CUTHBERTNECK', then press F3. This will give all
   156	players protection from enemy fire, but not from your team-mates' bullets. To
   157	return to normal press F3 once again.
   158	
   159	
   160	***KARATE KID 2***: Press P to go to next level 
   161	
   162	
   163	***MICKEY MOUSE***: After Mickey takes his bow, type 61315688 and a thin white
   164	line will flicker in the border. Hitting F2 opens the door to the sub-game, F3
   165	takes you straight to conflict with a witch, F4 refills your water pistol,
   166	Enter (keypad) quits the sub-game, "." on the keypad completes the sub-game
   167	successfully.
   168	
   169	
   170	***NEBULUS***: when on the title screen (with the music playing), type
   171	Helloiamjmp. Now, you can access any tower by simply pressing the appropriate
   172	function key. You also get infinite lives.
   173	
   174	
   175	***OUTRUN***
   176	Type in STARION whilst playing the game then select any of the following codes:
   177	B - Gives extended play

   183	
   184	
   185	***PLATOON***
   186	Type in 'Hamburger' at the title screen. The word 'Cheat' will appear below the
   187	credits press your joystck button, then (F5) when the jungle screen comes up.
   188	Your man is now invulnerable to the attacks of the little Commie @#!!$&*s. From
   189	here (F1) starts you where you are, (F2) puts you at the location of the
   190	explosives, (F3) takes you to the bridges that you have to blow up, (F4) takes
   191	you straight to the village where the entrance to the tunnels is hidden in one
   192	of the huts. From here on the cheat no longer works, the game runs as normal
   193	and you can die but it certainly gets you further along the track.
   194	
   195	
   196	***QUADRALIEN***: access codes: level 1- 170961, level 2- 010655, level 3-
   197	610169. And now, some tips: once in the core, you can't quit. So choose droids
   198	with good lasers, Jack and Spud for example. The Quadralien mother is made up
   199	of 4 separate pieces grouped together and surrounded by Earthling boxes. The
   200	mother can only be destroyed by blowing up each box from a different direction.
   201	From the starting point there are three exit: north, east, and west. Go east
   202	and destroy the first box, return to the starting point, and go north to
   203	destroy the second box. You will now have both droids to blow the remaining
   204	boxes. Go west through the one-way force field, and get the other. Don't forget
   205	to keep recharging.
   206	
   207	
   208	***RAMBO III*** -  get on the high-score list and type RENEGADE. Pressing 1,2
   209	and 3 will drop you on the level of your choice. And now for some tips:
   210	
   211	1) When inside the 2nd building, wear your IR goggles.
   212	2) Don't walk in front of soldiers, since it will trigger an alarm and about 8 
   213	   soldiers will jump you!
   214	3) If you enter a dark room, use the glow tube.
   215	4) Never use a gun without a silencer.
   216	5) Turn off the electric door with the switch located several rooms away.
   217	6) The mine detector won't work without the generator.
   218	7) The IR goggles won't work without a battery.
   219	8) Watch out for IR beams, since they also trigger alarms.
   220	
   221	Here's a list of items you can find: arrows, silencer, first aid kit, IR
   222	goggles, glow tube, battery, key, mine, detector (in 2 pieces), pistol, ammo,
   223	rubber gloves (you never know when you can be expected to perform major
   224	surgery!!!)
   225	
   226	
   227	***RAMPAGE***
   228	If you're on the last building and a cloud of dust appears under it punch in
   229	any direction and keep your finger on the fire button until the next screen is
   230	displayed, whereupon you will be ableto climb up an invisible building which is
   231	in the same place as the last building on the previous screen.
   232	
   233	
   234	***RETURN OF THE JEDI***: enter Darth Vader on the high score list instead of
   235	your name. Pressing F2 will complete a stage and send you to the next one.
   236	
   237	
   238	***SPACE HARRIER and SPACE HARRIER II***: if you look at disk two, you'll see
   239	some files called LEVEL2.DAT (for example). If you rename THEEND.DAT (or
   240	whatever it's called) to LEVEL1.DAT, you will see the end sequence without
   241	playing the game!
   242	
   243	
   244	***STARGLIDER***: this one is complex, so pay attention!!
   245	Start the game, slow down completely, press F, and press Backspace. Now, type
   246	in the following twice: JS(Space)ARG(Backspace)S(Backspace)(Return). Pressing N
   247	gives you 5000 points, E reboots the disk, M stops all enemy aircraft, P adds
   248	an extra missile.
   249	
   250	
   251	***STARGLIDER II***
   252	Select F (for fixed sights) then slow down to a dead stop and pause the game
   253	(using the backspace key).  Type 'Were on a Mission from God' (with the spaces
   254	and case also not important) and press '1' on the keyboard.  If the shield and
   255	energy levels drop to zero the cheat mode has been activated.  Press 'k' to get
   256	all the weapons (including the neutron bomb!), and when you run out just press
   257	'k' again.
   258	
   259	
   260	***STAR GOOSE***
   261	Hit all the function keys (F1 through F10) and you've got unlimited protection.
   262	
   263	
   264	***STARRAY***
   265	Unfortunately the cheat mode isn't as straightforward as the game play. Here's
   266	the step by step guide to getting an invincible ship. Make sure your mouse is
   267	plugged in, but don't use it to move the highlight.
   268	
   269	1. Access the OPTIONS SCREEN (ie: press the SPACE BAR).
   270	2. Move down to the VIEW GAME SCREEN option.
   271	3. Push the joystick LEFT and press FIRE. The GAME SCREEN should appear.
   272	4. Centre the joystick and press FIRE again. The OPTIONS SCREEN should
   273	   reappear.  Move down to the SOUND ON option.
   274	5. Push the joystick to the RIGHT and press FIRE. If SOUND ON 
   275	   changes to SOUND OFF, start again from scratch.
   276	6. Return to the VIEW GAME SCREEN option.
   277	7. Push the joystick RIGHT and while holding it in this direction, hold down   
   278	   the RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON.
   279	8. Press the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON.
   280	
   281	The OPTIONS SCREEN should change to CHEAT MODE. Return to RESUME GAME and
   282	continue play with a shield that never depletes. If this doesn't work, try
   283	again from a new game.
   284	
   285	
   286	***SUPER HANG-ON***
   287	On the high-score table enter 207L, which should then be replaced by a row of
   288	dots (indicating that there's cheating afoot). When the next screen appears,
   289	press CTRL, ALT, Z and T to get the cheat mode running, allowing you to change
   290	the strength of the centrifugal force (what a strange cheat!). Zero will allow
   291	you to whip around the course at top speed without crashing at all, while the
   292	higher numbers will more than likely send you off the course at every bend.
   293	
   294	
   295	***SUPER SPRINT***
   296	On track eight, instead of racing, turn around and position your car just
   297	before the finish line. Point it downwards, and when a drone zooms by,
   298	accelerate and drive it into the wall. It'll crash but it wont be replaced
   299	Repeat the process for the other two cars, and you'll be free to drive around
   300	at leisure, picking up as many spanners and bonus points as you like. Don't
   301	forget to drive around in the opposite direction, though otherwise you'll
   302	finish the race.
   303	
   304	
   305	***THUNDERBLADE***
   306	When on the title screen type in CRASH, causing the screen to flash quickly,
   307	indicating that the cheat mode is now active. Press UNDO whilst playing to
   308	advance to the next level.
   309	
   310	
   311	***VETERAN*** : Hitting the HELP key will take you through to the next level.
   312	
   313	
   314	***VIRUS***
   315	Start the game and hold down ENTER on the keypad. Whilst keeping it depressed,
   316	press P then O. Now when you thrust a third bar will appear below your fuel and
   317	altitude bars. Each of the following keys now have different effects...
   318	L - Gives you an extra missile and hoverplane
   319	D - Turns demo on/off
   320	F - Restores your fuel to full
   321	B - Disables graphics (pretty useless)
   322	N - Turns cheat mode off
   323	C - Disables graphics update (just makes a mess)
