     1	  This file contains the rules for Roleplaying in all of the games 
     2	within Galactic Net.  All persons wishing to take part in any of 
     3	the Roleplaying games in Galactic Net should download and read this
     4	file prior to join into a game.
     5	  We feel that these rules are simple and very direct. If you have 
     6	any questions or comments please feel free to post a message in the 
     7	General Chat conference of Galactic Net addressed to KATHY SHAW or 
     8	call Galactic Nets home base BBS GALACTICA ONE (609)723-3863 and 
     9	leave your message there.
    10	  All the Roleplaying games on Galactic Net are what we call 
    11	"Open Style RPG.".  What this means is that there is no Game Master
    12	or Dungeon Master and that players involved interact directly with
    13	other players in the game without getting prior approval of thier
    14	actions or plan before doing so.  But this has limitations that are
    15	covered in the rules below.
    16	   
    17	1. All persons wishing to join into a game must submit a message
    18	   to the Game Leader(s) telling us your characters name and
    19	   a brief discription of the character if the character is of
    20	   your own making.
    21	2. No foul language in any message.
    22	3. No personal insults towards another player.
    23	4. Allow other peoples characters to speak/reaspond to a message/
    24	   event by themselves.
    25	5. You can not kill or destroy another character or thier ship without
    26	   thier prior approval.  This can be handled via a private message
    27	   with in the game conference.
    28	6. All technical items in the game are to be based on the TV series/
    29	   Movie/book that the game is based on.   If a person wants to
    30	   introduce a new technology or race into a game they must first
    31	   get permission from the Game Leader(s) in the same manner that 
    32	   a request to join is made.
    33	7. In the event that an argument or dispute should occur the parties
    34	   involved should first try to settle it on thier own via private
    35	   messages.  If this dose not work than the Game leader(s) will try
    36	   and settle it being as fare to each party involved as possible.
    37	8. No Power Playing or nonsense playing.
    38	    example for Power Playing: 
    39	              Player A  " I have a BIG gun."
    40	              Player B  " Well my gun is Bigger than yours."
    41	    example for Nonsense playing.          
    42	              Player A  " I just launched 10 Torpedoes at your ship"
    43	              Player B  " My ship avoided all 10 Torpedoes and sent
    44	                          20 back at your ship and they all hit and
    45	                          destroyed your ship and all."
    46	
    47	    Please use comman sense when interacting.  Both of the above 
    48	    examples are typical enough.  
    49	9. Allow other players enough time to respond before moving onward.
    50	   Remember this is a Net and that it may take a few days to get a
    51	   reply to your postings.
    52	
    53	
    54	 Once we have enough players in each game than the Game Leaders will
    55	 select players that they feel are most able to be nonbiast and fare
    56	 among the group to be entered into an election for Group Leaders.
    57	 Each Game will then have 3 Group Leaders that can help keep the game
    58	 in control and moving smoothly.  When this time comes there will be
    59	 a set of Guidelines posted for the Group Leaders to follow.
