     9	       Sometimes it takes months or years to stumble onto the ESSENTIAL 
    10	       tips, tricks and traps with which every PC user should 
    11	       become acquainted. Let's discuss a few of the more important 
    12	       items which never seem to be covered adequately in the 
    13	       instruction book which arrives with the computer. Many of these 
    14	       tips apply to both laptops and desktop computers. If you are an 
    15	       advanced user, glance at all of the tips - this tutorial 
    16	       contains a sprinkling of basic, intermediate and advanced tips. 
    17	       A little something for everyone! Let's begin....
    18	          
    19	       Don't experiment with ORIGINAL copies of your files! If you want 
    20	       to tinker with a word processing file or slice and dice your 
    21	       accounting data FIRST make a floppy or hard disk copy of the 
    22	       file and then work on the COPY in case something goes wrong. 
    23	       That way you will have the original to fall back on in case you 
    24	       need it. 
    25	
    26	       Don't buy floppy disks when the price is too good to believe. If 
    27	       your data is worth anything at all, a few pennies more can make 
    28	       the difference between having that important business letter 
    29	       obtainable or a dreaded error message on the screen that your 
    30	       file format is unreadable just when you needed that file at 3 
    31	       AM. 
    32	
    33	       Make backup copies of important files. If the data is REALLY 
    34	       important, keep yet a second or third copy in a safe deposit box 
    35	       in case your home or office burns down! Sounds a little severe, 
    36	       but just wait until you discover the joy of doing your income 
    37	       tax return on your PC (fantastic compared to the old pen and 
    38	       pencil way) and then discover somehow the ONLY copy of the file 
    39	       is no good when the IRS decides to perform a routine audit! 
    40	
    41	       For backup you might want to switch from the COPY command to the 
    42	       sensational DOS XCOPY command (available in DOS versions 3.2 and 
    43	       later) which also allows file copying and backup using 
    44	       additional parameter switches which you can read about in your 
    45	       DOS manual. For example the /S switch used with XCOPY will copy 
    46	       all files from your subdirectories to the new target disk. 
    47	       Adding /P to XCOPY will cause a pause at each step to ask 
    48	       whether you want each file copied. Using the /D switch followed 
    49	       by a date will allow you to copy only those files created or 
    50	       modified on that date or later. All three of these switches can 
    51	       be used in tandem. 
    52	
    53	       Here's a standard tip which is so simple most people overlook 
    54	       it. Whenever you buy a box of new diskettes, FORMAT them 
    55	       immediately. Why? Reason one: you will find out if any disks are 
    56	       bad and be able to return to the store rather than be down to 
    57	       your last (surprise: defective!) disk when you need it. Reason 
    58	       two: usually you are right in the middle of a long word 
    59	       processed document and need to save the file, but OOPS, your 
    60	       current disk is full. No problem. Just reach into the desk 
    61	       drawer and grab an empty floppy disk. SURPRISE! The floppy disk 
    62	       is NOT FORMATTED which forces you to exit your word processor, 
    63	       lose the data permanently from RAM memory, and format the disk 
    64	       just as you should have in the first place. Beginners luck, I 
    65	       guess. . . 
    66	
    67	       Here's an extremely important tip most beginners should 
    68	       consider: AT class computers and those containing a 80286 CPU 
    69	       chip also contain a special battery to maintain the "setup 
    70	       configuration." This battery will eventually die and thus 
    71	       cause you to lose your important setup data. The first sign 
    72	       that your battery is going are mysterious losses of time and 
    73	       dates. Other "strange" data losses may start to occur. 
    74	       
    75	       Eventually your computer will even refuse to start! Preventative 
    76	       maintenance suggests that you dig around on your DOS disk(s) and 
    77	       locate the SETUP program. Run setup and when you see the 
    78	       configuration report screen (lots of funny numbers and 
    79	       settings), hit the SHIFT-PRTSC (Shift key and Print Screen key 
    80	       pressed at the same time). This will force a printout of the 
    81	       valuable setup data to paper. You can also obtain shareware and 
    82	       commercial software programs that will store this data to disk.
    83	       Most experienced users deal with the situation by making a 
    84	       copy of this setup data onto a "safety disk." If your battery 
    85	       dies, you will be able to quickly reconstruct the setup data 
    86	       from your paper sheet or safety disk after replacing the battery 
    87	       and running the setup program (or safety disk backup program.)
    88	       
    89	       A better method, of course, is to realize that the battery 
    90	       contained inside the computer lasts for about 2 to 4 years 
    91	       and simply keep a record (much like oil changes on your car) 
    92	       and manually replace it well before the deadline. Of course 
    93	       when you replace it, run the setup program and record the 
    94	       setup data on paper, since once you remove the battery the 
    95	       data will be lost from memory. You might investigate newer 
    96	       battery systems which automatically recharge themselves from the 
    97	       power source of the computer and thus never need replacement.
    98	       
    99	       IBM originally designed this feature, by the way, to supplant 
   100	       the older "dip switch system" on the first PC's. In older 
   101	       computers of the XT design, a user had to remove the PC cover and 
   102	       carefully set tiny switches deep inside the computer whenever a 
   103	       different circuit board or monitor system was used. This was 
   104	       tedious, so the software equivalent of the tiny switches were 
   105	       created in memory with settings stored by battery (when the 
   106	       computer was shut down). This allowed users to change the setup 
   107	       from the keyboard using the DOS setup program from the DOS disk 
   108	       rather than removing the cover and fiddling with switches. The 
   109	       downside is that now we must replace the battery periodically 
   110	       and of course record the setup data on paper or disk. Technology 
   111	       marches on!
   112	
   113	       Here's an "insider's" tip power users are familiar with. When 
   114	       working with long text or document files such as instructions 
   115	       for shareware packages, business letters and other text files it 
   116	       is frequently useful to extract small portions to a separate 
   117	       file or print for future reference. Power users frequently use 
   118	       the shareware program LIST which browses or displays these 
   119	       documents and can "clip" screens using the frequently overlooked
   120	       ALT-O key (press and hold ALT then hit O). Assuming LIST is 
   121	       currently browsing your document, it will ask for the name of a 
   122	       file to create which you may supply (e.g., custom.doc). List 
   123	       will extract that single screen of data to the file. As you 
   124	       continue browsing the document, hitting ALT-O will append or add 
   125	       any additional screens to the special target file! When finished 
   126	       you have a compact file of extracted text data which you can save, 
   127	       print or edit with your word processor rather than wading 
   128	       through endless screens of the lengthy master document! LIST 
   129	       is available from all shareware vendors, many computer clubs and 
   130	       individual users. Several shareware vendors are listed in the 
   131	       tutorial on software.
   132	
   133	       Want the ultimate simple database? Combine LIST with any simple 
   134	       word processor or text editor. Using your word processor type in 
   135	       any list of ideas, phone numbers, addresses, parts inventory 
   136	       which needs to be tracked. Save the information on disk as an 
   137	       ASCII (plain text) file. Load the file into LIST using the 
   138	       appropriate command (e.g., LIST INFO.DOC) and use the high speed 
   139	       search feature by pressing the F key (F for find) and enter a 
   140	       search phrase to locate (e.g., Denver). List will locate that 
   141	       phrase and the information near it very rapidly. Pressing the F3 
   142	       key will take you to the NEXT occurrence of the same search 
   143	       phrase. When finished, hit the HOME key to return to the top of 
   144	       the document to begin a new search. Technically you could use 
   145	       your word processor's search feature to locate information also, 
   146	       but LIST is quicker and more flexible. To update your simple 
   147	       database, periodically edit the master document with your word 
   148	       processor to change, delete or update entries. 
   149	       
   150	       When you turn on your computer each morning does DOS greet you 
   151	       with several prompts instead of one? Do you see:
   152	
   153	       C>
   154	       C>
   155	       C>
   156	
   157	       This is easy to fix since most beginners are unaware that 
   158	       someone has probably tinkered with the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and 
   159	       inadvertantly added a few extra carriage returns to the end of 
   160	       the file by pressing the return key several times when the file 
   161	       was orginally created and saved on disk. Simply load AUTOEXEC.BAT 
   162	       back into your word processor and remove all (usually invisible) 
   163	       lines and spaces and carriage returns at the end of the file 
   164	       (use the delete key). Resave the file as ASCII text with the same 
   165	       name and your problem should disappear.
   166	       
   167	       Beginners also need to know about the alternate keyboard. 
   168	       Sometimes you need a special symbol like the cents sign, the 
   169	       British currency (pounds sterling) symbol, or the one half 
   170	       fraction sign. IBM compatable computers contain an "alternate 
   171	       keyboard" system which allows access to special math, foreign 
   172	       language and graphics symbols. The source is a special ASCII 
   173	       chart printed in the appendix of your DOS manual as well as most 
   174	       computer reference books. It's easy to use this system: while 
   175	       you are in your word processor, DOS or other program, press AND 
   176	       CONTINUOUSLY HOLD DOWN the Alt key and then USING ONLY THE 
   177	       NUMBER KEYS ON THE NUMERIC KEYPAD (to the right of the keyboard, 
   178	       not the normal number keys above the keyboard) hit the three 
   179	       digit DECIMAL number code of the special character you need. 
   180	       
   181	       For example, from the ASCII table in the back of my DOS manual I 
   182	       note that the symbol for the British currency Pound is decimal 
   183	       code 156. I hold down the Alt key, press in sequence the three 
   184	       numbers 156 on the numeric keypad and finally release the ALT 
   185	       key to get the proper symbol on my screen. 
   186	              
   187	       There are many useful symbols for foreign languages, math, 
   188	       fractions, foreign currency, symbols to draw boxes, lines and 
   189	       useful graphics symbols. Note that these ASCII symbols will 
   190	       usually display properly on your screen but MIGHT NOT print 
   191	       properly on your printer since some are used for special control 
   192	       codes and other activities. Many will, however, display on both 
   193	       your screen and printer. 
   194	       
   195	       Jot down the codes for the most interesting ASCII symbols to 
   196	       keep near your keyboard! By the way, PC-Magazine published a 
   197	       shareware utility called ASC.COM several years ago (available 
   198	       from many computer clubs and BBS systems) which can "pop up" 
   199	       over many of your programs and display the full ASCII code table 
   200	       for quick reference and handy use if you don't want to go 
   201	       searching for the ASCII index in the back of your DOS manual. 
   202	       
   203	       Before leaving the discussion about the alternate keyboard, note 
   204	       that crucial control of your printer - setting various typefaces 
   205	       and features - can be provided via a combination of batch files 
   206	       and use of the alternate keyboard. See the printer discussion at 
   207	       the end of the batch file tutorial elsewhere on this disk.
   208	
   209	       Absolutely lethal trick: If you get the message ABORT, RETRY 
   210	       IGNORE? from DOS while you are attempting to copy files from 
   211	       one drive or disk to another DO NOT EVER switch disks in the 
   212	       target drive (i.e., the drive to which files will be sent) then 
   213	       answer RETRY. 
   214	
   215	       If you do, you will end up with a hopelessly scrambled mess on 
   216	       the target disk if it already has important files in place. This 
   217	       can occur, for example, when you try to copy files to a disk 
   218	       which has a write protect tab in place. Your temptation might be 
   219	       to insert another different disk and retry. However, when DOS 
   220	       copies files, it first reads the directory of the target disk 
   221	       and stores it in memory. If you switch disks, the in-memory copy 
   222	       of the directory of the OLD disk will overwrite the directory of 
   223	       the new disk. Best situation in this case is to answer abort and 
   224	       rekey the operation again (shortcut with DOS is hit F3 to 
   225	       automatically reissue the last command) then try another disk, 
   226	       if necessary. There are other ways this dangerous situation might 
   227	       arise besides a write protect tab, so be careful. 
   228	
   229	       Don't install or change add-in circuit boards or cards within 
   230	       your computer with the power on. And be extremely careful about 
   231	       static electricity. Try to briefly touch a metal ground such as 
   232	       a lamp or metal window frame to discharge stray static 
   233	       electricity before you touch your fingers inside the PC. Static 
   234	       electricity discharges can blow out one or several integrated 
   235	       circuit chips and leave you with a repair bill of $300 or more! 
   236	
   237	       If you ever see the message:    ARE YOU SURE (Y/N)?     always 
   238	       answer no unless you really know what is going to happen next! 
   239	       This message usually precedes disaster as DOS prepares to delete 
   240	       all of the files on a floppy disk or format your hard drive and 
   241	       wipe out all data. 
   242	
   243	       Don't invite dumb power problems. You are typing the last draft 
   244	       of a valuable client contract and your 30 foot long power cord 
   245	       dangles in front of both family cats on its meandering way 
   246	       across the middle of the living room carpet to the wall socket. 
   247	       It is plugged into a rat's nest of four way plug adapters along 
   248	       with high-current drawing air conditioners and toaster ovens. 
   249	       This is a great way to send your data to toaster heaven while we 
   250	       are on the subject. 
   251	
   252	       Treat your hard drive with EXTREME tender loving care while it 
   253	       is spinning. No bumps, jolts, slams or ramma-lamma-ding-dongs! 
   254	       One little bump will send the read/write heads plowing into the 
   255	       spinning disk surface. Kind of like a 747 jet crash into the 
   256	       library of congress. Translation: large data catastrophe! 
   257	
   258	       If your data is sensitive and you lock the keyboard with that 
   259	       cute little key which slips into the front panel of your 
   260	       machine, DON'T forget to remove the mouse or other input 
   261	       devices. Since a mouse is an alternate input device, a savvy 
   262	       user can easily direct the computer to spill forth its 
   263	       information even while the keyboard is locked. 
   264	
   265	       Use the DOS command DISKCOPY in ONLY two cases: to make a backup 
   266	       copy of new commercial software OR when you have somehow damaged 
   267	       a disk and want to work on it with the Norton utilities or some 
   268	       other recovery program. For all other copies you are safer to use 
   269	       the COPY or XCOPY command. Reason? DISKCOPY does not remove file 
   270	       fragmentation which COPY does. Second reason? DISKCOPY can 
   271	       attempt to copy good information onto a target disk sector which 
   272	       has formatted bad or is otherwise unavailable to DOS. Use COPY 
   273	       *.* to copy all files on a disk and you will simultaneously copy 
   274	       everything and unfragment the files. Two operations for the 
   275	       price of one! 
   276	
   277	       Thunderstorm coming? Shut down the computer and unplug it from 
   278	       the wall INCLUDING the modem or telephone line! LIghtning hits 
   279	       to the power or phone line send very high voltages hurtling down 
   280	       the wire. If you prefer you can leave the computer plugged in 
   281	       and chose as to whether you wish your PC scrambled, sunnyside up 
   282	       or just deep fried! 
   283	
   284	       Never switch or remove disks in the middle of an aborted program 
   285	       operation. If for some reason you get an error message in the 
   286	       middle of a file copying session or disk writing operation, 
   287	       don't swap in another disk! DOS may think the old disk is still 
   288	       there and continue to write the remainder of the data over 
   289	       something valuable on the new disk! Better to stop what you are 
   290	       doing and issue a non-writing command such as VER or DIR or even 
   291	       shut down the computer in extreme situations rather than mangle 
   292	       two disks with misinformation. 
   293	
   294	       Be careful using the DOS commands ASSIGN, FORMAT and RECOVER. 
   295	       Especially if you are being a little too clever and change disk 
   296	       drive letters with the DOS commands ASSIGN, JOIN and SUBST. What 
   297	       happens is that you might temporarily rename your hard drive the 
   298	       B: drive and then absent-mindedly try to format B: or recover B: 
   299	       which will lead to a lot of deleted data on your hard drive. 
   300	       Generally the RECOVER command is best removed from your DOS 
   301	       subdirectory and never used. It is just too dangerous! 
   302	
   303	       If you delete some files by accident, Norton Utilities, PC Tools 
   304	       and several other utility programs can bring them back if you 
   305	       are quick to use them and haven't created or changed any files 
   306	       since the accident. Best to go out and get a copy of Norton, PC 
   307	       Tools or a shareware unerase utility (e.g., Bakers Dozen) before 
   308	       the need arises. Then practice using them on a dummy disk for 
   309	       the likely day you need them. 
   310	
   311	       Be careful when using the powerful DOS redirection and piping 
   312	       commands discussed in our earlier DOS tutorial. 
   313	
   314	       (example)     a>sort < this.doc   (sorts contents of this.doc on 
   315	                                         column one and displays contents 
   316	                                         on the monitor - a nice idea!) 
   317	
   318	       (example)    a>sort > this.doc    (trashes any existing this.doc 
   319	                                         and gives it a file length of 
   320	                                         zero! Bad news!) 
   321	
   322	       The same advice also applies to using the MORE command with 
   323	       redirection arrows <  > since you can likewise wipe out data 
   324	       files. Watch the direction of those cute little redirection 
   325	       arrows! Same thing applies to using the redirection arrows when 
   326	       you write batch files. Look at the sample line from a batch file 
   327	       listing below: 
   328	
   329	       (example)   ECHO -------->This message is important! 
   330	
   331	       In the above example, DOS will erroneously think the little > 
   332	       redirection symbol is telling it to create a file named THIS and 
   333	       use ECHO to redirect text from that line of the batch file into 
   334	       the file. A goofy, dangerous result! Another good boner is the 
   335	       following batch file example: 
   336	
   337	       (example) ECHO  Now use the c>prompt to return to DOS
   338	
   339	       The above perfectly innocent batch file line creates a file 
   340	       called PROMPT because DOS spots the > symbol and does what you 
   341	       told it to do! 
   342	
   343	       Instructions mean business! If program documentation says MUST 
   344	       BE USED ON A COLOR MONITOR don't try to run it on your hercules 
   345	       or monochrome system. Software can indeed destroy a monitor and 
   346	       it only takes a second! Know what your monitor and display card 
   347	       can handle and be SURE that the intended software matches 
   348	       hardware capabilities. 
   349	
   350	       If you suspect a business or individual may be illegally using a 
   351	       commercial software package, for example buying one copy and then 
   352	       installing MANY copies on various machines, you should report 
   353	       the violation to the Software Publishers Association. Call 
   354	       tollfree: 800/388-7478. SPA use of Federal and State law 
   355	       enforcement methods is sudden and highly visible. The SPA is 
   356	       quite aggressive on this point. The majority of calls received 
   357	       by the SPA are from "whistleblowing" employees within a business 
   358	       which is illegally using software. 
   359	
   360	       If you use a RAMDISK to hold data be sure to stop every half 
   361	       hour and copy the information into a more permanent floppy or 
   362	       hard disk area in case of power failures. In fact every half 
   363	       hour, check to see that your data from ANY program is 
   364	       transferred to magnetic disk. No exceptions! 
   365	
   366	       For those using the newer disks having 1.44 Meg and 720 K sizes 
   367	       - those little plastic diskettes - don't swap and mix formats 
   368	       willy nilly. Label the diskettes clearly and know the format 
   369	       density (1.44M or 720K) with which you are working. 
   370	
   371	       If data is sensitive and you want it GONE from snooping eyes, 
   372	       use a utility like Norton's WIPEFILE to truly delete it from the 
   373	       disk so an office curiosity seeker can't bring it back with an 
   374	       unerase utility! 
   375	
   376	       Likewise, some word processors create backup files having the 
   377	       extension BAK. You may think you have deleted that sensitive 
   378	       client proposal when a second document CLIENT.BAK also exists! 
   379	
   380	       DOS manuals make reference to the VERIFY command. You can add 
   381	       the /V switch to the COPY command to supposedly verify the 
   382	       accuracy of the second file copy. Likewise you can turn VERIFY 
   383	       ON and VERIFY OFF from within your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. 
   384	       Unfortunately, the VERIFY command does a rudimentary CRC check 
   385	       which can test only gross errors in file transfers. To be sure 
   386	       the second copy is good, use the COMP command which, although 
   387	       slow, is deadly reliable when you "gotta be sure." The FC 
   388	       command found in MSDOS versions is even better and DOS manuals 
   389	       discuss its use. Likewise use the DISKCOMP command whenever you 
   390	       use DISKCOPY if you absolutely have to be certain that the 
   391	       second diskette is PERFECTLY identical to the first.

   433	                        ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE COMPUTING
   434	
   435	       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
   436	
   437	       Computing has impacts on the earth and I would like to share a 
   438	       few constructive suggestions and tips about saving resources and
   439	       protecting the environment. 
   440	
   441	       Computing uses paper. Keep two wastebaskets by your desk and
   442	       recycle. Same for cardboard packing boxes and packing materials
   443	       which arrive with computing equipment.
   444	
   445	       But let's go a little deeper with the paper issue: Do you really 
   446	       need to print on multiple part carbonless forms and heavyweight 
   447	       computer paper? I use a lightweight 18# paper in my little dot 
   448	       matrix printer. How about carbonless and two part forms? The 
   449	       chemicals used in the manufacture of carbonless paper are toxic. 
   450	       Do you really need a two part form (or 6 part form in the case of 
   451	       some corporations which go wild with multipart forms?) Why not 
   452	       see if a single part form can be made with a tear off stub or 
   453	       perhaps a file saving feature in the software that traps the data 
   454	       and saves it to disk for "your copy" of the form? Just like 
   455	       banks: ask the customer if they want their checks back: meaning 
   456	       does your customer need seven copies of a form or will your monthly 
   457	       invoice statement cover the bill?
   458	       
   459	       Environmentally responsible computing also means ONLY upgrading 
   460	       machines when you really need to or buying a used computer. Here's 
   461	       why: the manufacture of integrated circuits used in computers uses 
   462	       large amounts of concentrated acids, gasses and caustic chemicals. 
   463	       These are stored, recycled or (hopefully) dumped into approved waste 
   464	       sites in normal practice, but the point is do you really need 
   465	       the latest machine and its impact on our planet given the toxic 
   466	       nature of computer manufacturing processes? This package was 
   467	       written on an XT class machine. I don't need anything better, 
   468	       and when I do, I hope to find a USED "recycled" computer of 
   469	       higher quality rather than buying a new one. Same with printers, 
   470	       modems and so forth! Here in Seattle, several computer brokers 
   471	       specialize in reselling used computers on consignment. Head that 
   472	       direction for your next purchase! It's less expensive and helps 
   473	       the planet! 
   474	
   475	       As a commercial photographer by training, I use a Seattle film 
   476	       lab for some of my photo processing. The lab uses an 8 1/2 by
   477	       11 inch TWO part carbonless form to log in each order, they 
   478	       later mail me a THREE part carbonless invoice for EACH order 
   479	       within a few days by mail, then a final billing statement at 
   480	       the end of the month AND they have 4 computer terminals in the 
   481	       order processing customer counter area of the lab! I am sure 
   482	       their accounting is extraordinarily well documented, but there 
   483	       may not be enough trees on this earth to support this kind of 
   484	       "information flow" if every business operated this way. I could 
   485	       do with a small claim stub when I drop off my film, a little
   486	       itemization printed on the paper envelope which contains the 
   487	       finished order and perhaps a monthly statement printed on 
   488	       recycled paper to summarize the account activity. The ironic 
   489	       footnote is that the same lab has a sign prominently posted in 
   490	       the lobby as to willingness to accept cardboard and plastic 
   491	       (from things like film containers) for the benefit of the 
   492	       environment! Clearly the right hand doesn't know what the left 
   493	       hand is doing and sadly computers are pushing the waste factor 
   494	       in this real life example.
   495	       
   496	       If you suspect I am beating the environmental drum too loudly, 
   497	       back up and consider the financial COST to an operation like the 
   498	       film lab mentioned above. Unwise from the financial end and 
   499	       equally unwise from the environmental end.
   500	
   501	       Computing uses electricity. If you are just stepping out of the 
   502	       office for a half hour or so, it is probably best for the machine 
   503	       to leave it on and the hard drive spinning to prevent the wear and 
   504	       tear of machine startup which eventually wears out a hard drive.
   505	       
   506	       However, turn off the monitor if you are away for even short 
   507	       periods using its own separate power switch (leaving the PC on) 
   508	       even if you use screen blanker software since the monitor is 
   509	       still drawing power! When should you turn off the machine 
   510	       completely? Use the two hour rule: if you are away from the PC 
   511	       NO MORE than two hours, leave the machine on. If away MORE than 
   512	       two hours, shut it off. Also factor in the dust argument which 
   513	       follows:
   514	       
   515	       Don't leave a PC on all night or LONG periods of time. The dust 
   516	       sucked through your machine by constant fan use will more than 
   517	       offset the savings in wear and tear you may gain by leaving the 
   518	       hard drive spinning! The dust impacts the power supply which is 
   519	       the heart of the system. If the power supply goes bad due to 
   520	       overheating (because of a thick blanket of internal dust) it 
   521	       can destroy your entire PC! For the curious or mechanically adept, 
   522	       open the power supply WITH ALL APPROPRIATE PRECAUTIONS IN AN 
   523	       UNPLUGGED AND COMPLETELY DISCHARGED MACHINE. You will be stunned 
   524	       by the dust you see! I regularly take my pc and power supply cover 
   525	       off and give the internals a LIGHT blast of compressed air (not 
   526	       ozone-destroying freon) to free the dust and help the machine run 
   527	       cooler. I do this every six months.
   528	
   529	       Do a calculation for your office on your PC: how much wattage
   530	       does an average PC in your office draw per hour? How many PC's
   531	       in your office? What is the TOTAL economic cost leaving them ALL
   532	       on during the night (12 hours?) versus turning them off? Now how 
   533	       much a month, then how much a year. Finally, multiply by the cost
   534	       per killowatt hour for cost per year. This doesn't even consider 
   535	       maintenance savings or waste - just electricity!
   536	              
   537	       Plastics and computing are everywhere. Talk to a recycler and 
   538	       see if they can accept polyethelene packing bags, stryrofoam 
   539	       packing, printer cartridges and so forth. 
   540	       
   541	       If you are involved in large corporate purchases, ask the 
   542	       vendor to supply a one page sheet describing how they use 
   543	       LESS in an environmentally safe way in providing your computing 
   544	       equipment needs (e.g., do they use popcorn from a growing 
   545	       plant (which is now common) rather than styrofoam chips for 
   546	       packing, do they recycle paper in their organization, etc.)? 
   547	       Vendors just might take notice if large organizations asked 
   548	       for a one page "computing impact statement" from each 
   549	       computing supplies vendor. If your vendor doesn't know what 
   550	       you mean by a "computing impact statement," send THIS 
   551	       printout as an example and ask them again for their statement.
   552	       
   553	       Try to recharge printer ink cartridges if possible. Same with 
   554	       laser printers. A nutty but workable method of recharging
   555	       a FABRIC printer cartridge is to take it outside, lay it 
   556	       on a piece of newspaper, pry off the plastic cartridge lid 
   557	       and lightly spray the ribbon with the lubricant WD-40. Replace 
   558	       the lid of the printer cartridge and allow a few hours for the 
   559	       WD-40 oil to redistribute ink from the edges of the ribbon 
   560	       (where the printhead does NOT strike the ribbon) to the center 
   561	       strip of the ribbon. Recharged cartridges at the cost of a few 
   562	       pennies of WD-40! This method works best with cloth fabric 
   563	       ribbons not mylar ribbons, but I am told a few people have even 
   564	       tried this with the mylar ribbons too. Professional ink and 
   565	       ribbon recharge companies exist, investigate this option!
   566	
   567	       Consider using shareware rather than commercial software. How 
   568	       does this positively affect the environment? Simple. Shareware 
   569	       uses simple packaging or NONE AT ALL since it frequently 
   570	       travels electronically by BBS/modem methods, isn't returned to 
   571	       the wholesaler to be sent to the garbage dump if too many 
   572	       packages are manufactured, supports a small software programmer 
   573	       who has less impact on the earth as a single human being rather 
   574	       than a large corporation and provides you with high quality at 
   575	       a fair price which goes well with the environmental features. 
   576	       This isn't just a sales pitch, shareware DOES have less negative 
   577	       impact on the environment than commercial software!
   578	
   579	       Speaking of laser printers, the environmental cost and economic 
   580	       cost is NOT favorable. Toner, paper, electricity, everything 
   581	       about lasers is less favorable to the earth. Use a humble dot 
   582	       matrix printer unless you are ready for the final draft. Lasers
   583	       need more maintenance, too. Finally people are forever buying
   584	       MORE plastic font cartridges and upgrades for lasers. 
   585	
   586	       In this respect, a good compromise if you need laser quality and 
   587	       sharpness in printing, is to consider using BUBBLEJET printers 
   588	       which produce crisp "near laser" quality, but use far less ink, 
   589	       plastic cartridge material and electricity than a conventional 
   590	       laser printer. Most software packages now support bubblejet 
   591	       printers.
   592	
   593	       Back to the paper issue. Do you really need to send a memo or 
   594	       submit a rough draft on paper? Can you get the boss to accept 
   595	       the memo on disk and teach the boss how to use a simple file 
   596	       browser to read the file? Pick up the phone and call with the 
   597	       information, it is a faster, more human in scale and saves 
   598	       resources.
   599	
   600	       Let's talk about envelopes: if your office uses window style 
   601	       envelopes for billings or mailings, try to design or use  
   602	       window envelopes WITH EMPTY WINDOW OPENINGS RATHER THAN 
   603	       CLEAR PLASTIC WINDOW OPENINGS. The billing address peeks out the 
   604	       front just the same and becomes recyclable! Plastic containing
   605	       envelopes cannot be recycled. Otherwise try to pre-print the
   606	       address on the return envelope - anything but plastic windows.
   607	
   608	       FAX processes are wonderful. Investigate FAXing onto disk (using 
   609	       a FAX board installed in your computer) rather than paper 
   610	       printouts of FAXES. This produces an electronic FAX file which 
   611	       is saved on disk rather than printing on paper.
   612	
   613	       Do you program or sell software? Why not recycle disks? Simply 
   614	       slap your new label over that old disk no longer needed and add 
   615	       a line that "this is a recycled disk" on the bottom of your disk 
   616	       label or jacket. Most folks approve of greeting cards printed on 
   617	       recycled paper. Do you really need to use a fresh new disk to 
   618	       impress your client when a recycled one with a new label will do?
   619	
   620	       Keep your keyboard, computer and printer clean. Once in a while
   621	       vacuum or dust out the power supply which collects loads of dust.
   622	       Reason: you prevent breakdowns which require repairs or scrapping 
   623	       of the computer. End result: more earth resources used which 
   624	       could have been prevented in the first place with a little
   625	       preventative maintenance.
   626	
   627	       Look at your software and documentation shelf. Stacks of old 
   628	       computer magazines and documentation pile up! Have a once a 
   629	       month PC recycling party where you rip out pages from 
   630	       documentation and magazines you really need and recycle the 
   631	       remains. Same goes for old disks, binders, the works.
   632	
   633	       Donations. If computers help you make money, and they do, set 
   634	       aside a small contribution to the non-profit group of your choice 
   635	       which is involved in conservation and recycling. 
   636	
   637	       Submit suggestions for this little part of the tutorial on "how 
   638	       your office saves the earth using computers WISELY." I'll try to 
   639	       insert it if valuable and of course, it will float all over the 
   640	       world on BBS systems and shareware distribution points so your 
   641	       small or large suggestion WILL possibly make a difference to 
   642	       somebody in Brazil or China. This is a shareware package 
   643	       which lives electronically on the Compuserve network which is 
   644	       accessed by people all over the world! If possible, send your 
   645	       suggestion on disk in ASCII using your word processor so I can 
   646	       electronically merge it. 
   647	              
   648	       Don't compute when you don't need to! Sometimes it is too easy to 
   649	       turn on the machine and bang out a spreadsheet or draft a memo.
   650	       Can you solve the problem with your BRAIN or grab your rolodex to 
   651	       find that phone number? Our brains our much more capable than 
   652	       the most modern computer. What can you do better by leaving the 
   653	       machine OFF and not using electricity, paper, plastic, ink and
   654	       toner? Finally, turning off the computer means we spend a few
   655	       minutes with each other, rather than our (let's face it) 
   656	       addictive computers. You just may come up with a solution to 
   657	       that budget problem by visiting with a colleague at the next desk 
   658	       rather than recalculating that monster spreadsheet for the millionth
   659	       time trying to find an optimum budget solution for the office.
   660	       The vast majority of business problems are solved by CREATIVITY
   661	       which organic brains do best! 
   662	
   663	       Print (on paper, unfortunately) this little section of the 
   664	       computer tutorial and place it on the company bulletin board. 
   665	       This is a win/win situation: your co-workers will start to think 
   666	       about earth conscious computing and if more beginners will use 
   667	       PC-LEARN they will learn how to use a computer more efficiently 
   668	       SOONER and thus WASTE LESS paper, electricity and natural 
   669	       resources, does that make sense? Computer beginners can waste a 
   670	       lot of paper, money, time and electricity learning how to use a 
   671	       computer. If PC-LEARN helps them learn faster, then they should 
   672	       waste less and become proficient more quickly! 
   673	
   674	       Consider renting computer equipment for short term and special 
   675	       projects. Obviously you can save money in most cases, but the 
   676	       larger issue is that you don't impact the environment by using 
   677	       resources for something you can share that computer equipment with 
   678	       many other people via a rental arrangement.
   679	              
   680	       When you print lengthy documents from a disk to paper, 
   681	       investigate clever software products (many of them shareware) 
   682	       which allow you to print FOUR pages in tiny but readable 
   683	       typeface and on BOTH SIDES of the paper.

   686	       a registered user to submit a suggestion to this section!

   691	
   692	       "A company I used to work for had a mainframe computer in 
   693	       Connecticut with office hubs in Houston and LA. Approximately 40 
   694	       reports were printed from a spooler set up to do this routine in 
   695	       over 200 offices in the U.S. EVERY NIGHT! The company had a 
   696	       guilty feeling about the environment so asked each office to 
   697	       submit ideas." 
   698	
   699	       "I suggested that they take the reports off line. Make them 
   700	       available on demand only, put them on a screen with a 48 hour 
   701	       hold on daily reports. 10 day old on weekly reports and 40 day 
   702	       hold on monthly reports. Also suggested that when reports were 
   703	       printed, NOT to send a blank page to set line space or formfeed. 
   704	       This could be performed by the local office if needed. Obviously 
   705	       the computers in the company were turned over to the controllers 
   706	       who decided who got to see which reports and screens." 
   707	
   708	       "Our initial calculations were staggering, then we found out 
   709	       that we were one of the frugal offices! By our accountant's 
   710	       calculations we cut back over 4000 cases of paper nationwide per 
   711	       MONTH! Latest calculation is closer to 5000 cases."
