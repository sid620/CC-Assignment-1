     4	          A modem is a device that allows a computer to communicate
     5	          and transfer files with other computers over a telephone
     6	          line. The word modem is an acronym. Modem stands for
     7	          modulator-demodulator.  
     8	          
     9	          When a modem sends data, it is acting as a digital to
    10	          analog converter. That is, it takes data in digital form
    11	          and converts it to sound (analog) to go over a telephone
    12	          line. The modem on the receiving end acts as an analog to
    13	          digital converter. It takes the sound (analog) it
    14	          receives and translates it into data. 
    15	          
    16	          If you want to have some fun, go to the largest super
    17	          computer store that you can find. One with plenty of
    18	          salespeople. Find a salesperson who looks eager. Tell him
    19	          you are new to computers; however, a friend told you to
    20	          get a modulator-demodulator for your computer. One
    21	          salesperson will ask another and so on up the chain. If
    22	          it gets to the top, you might be nice and give them a
    23	          hint: "I believe he said it was also called a modem." 
    24	          
    25	          
    26	          WHY MODEM?
    27	          
    28	          The question is not, "Why modem?" but, "Why not Modem?"
    29	          People are buying modems and learning how to use them for
    30	          all kinds of reasons. Below are fifteen popular reasons
