     4	                              for
     5	                       The 520/1040 Series
     6	                              by

    11	Purpose:  This document is a description of the hook-ups and mod-
    12	          ifications that I found necessary in adding a 3.5 inch
    13	          double sided drive to my Atari(tm) 520. It is intended
    14	          solely as a guide to anyone who is interested in saving
    15	          a few dollars by using an "industry standard" drive in 
    16	          place of the Atari SF314.
    17	
    18	Warning:  This installation seems to function properly for my sys-
    19	          tem, but I cannot guarantee anything. Also, the only way
    20	          that a saving will result is if a suitable power supply
    21	          is already available, or can be obtained at a very low
    22	          price.
    23	
    24	Requirements: 1  3.5" Double Sided Drive w/ Installation kit @ $130
    25	                 (The Unit I used was a Toshiba(tm) ND-352 
    26	                  which came with a multi-purpose mounting
    27	                  kit. BE SURE that the unit is XT compat-
    28	                  ible!!(720 K etc))
    29	              1  5v/12vdc Regulated Power Supply             @ $ 25
    30	                 (The supply must be capable of supplying
    31	                  5V.+/-5% @200 mA and 12V.+/-5% @300 mA.
    32	                  I saved some money here by using the same
    33	                  supply that I used for adding a 5 1/4 in.
    34	                  drive as described in numerous articles
    35	                  in magazines and on Bulletin Boards.)
    36	
    37	              1  34 pin Card Edge Connector                  @ $  3
    38	                 (Yes, This is the "industry standard"
    39	                  used on all XT's and Clones. I got mine
    40	                  at Radio Shack (P/N____________).)
    41	
    42	              1  Standard Atari(tm) 3.5 in Disk Drive Cable  @ $  8
    43	                 (Preferably, one of the After Market types
    44	                  6' or so in length.)  
    45	
    46	              1  Disk Drive Case                             @ $  ?
    47	                 (This is optional--I still haven't found
    48	                  a good cheap one, but the drive seems to
    49	                  work fine.)
    50	
    51	Procedure: There are two ways to proceed with this project depending
    52	           on whether you want the new drive to be A or B. The Drive
    53	           B method is the simpler, so I will start with it.
    54	
    55	           Cut the Standard Drive Cable in half (Save the other 
    56	           half for another project--maybe!)
    57	
    58	           Strip back about 2" of the outer insulation from the 
    59	           cable. Do Not cut off the shield wire (a layer of wire
    60	           woven around the multiple conductors in the cable). 
    61	           Carefully unweave the shield, and twist it to form a
    62	           wire of its own.
    63	
    64	           Since the 34 pin connector that I used was designed for
    65	           ribbon cable, some ingenuity is required here. Each pin
    66	           on the connector ends in a V shaped stud designed to 
    67	           separate the ribbon cable wire and cut only its insul-
    68	           ation when the cover is forced in place. Since most of
    69	           the wires in the cable go to the top row of the con-
    70	           nector (the even numbered pins) and the shield goes
    71	           to the bottom row, along with the wires from pins 3 and
    72	           7 of the Atari connector, I divided them accordingly and
    73	           routed them above and below the connector cover. Very
    74	           carefully, I pushed each wire far enough into the cor-
    75	           responding Vstud to hold it in place. I then forced
    76	           the cover down, forcing the wires the rest of the way
    77	           into the V. By trial and error I found that the two 
    78	           ground wires (pins 3 and 7) in the cable did not provide
    79	           a sufficient ground path, causing unreliable drive oper-
    80	           ation. I overcame this by (gasp!) tying the shield to
    81	           ALL of the odd numbered pins on the connector. (That's
    82	           what the twisted shield wire is used for.) Carefully 
    83	           lay it over the bottom row of Vstuds before putting 
    84	           the connector cover on. The Connections Follow:

    88	              Cable.)

   110	
   111	           Assemble the Disk Drive and Adapter kit. It should have
   112	           come with a power cable adapter with a std XT con-
   113	           nector on the end. You can either buy a mating 
   114	           connector or cut it off and splice directly to the wires.
   115	           (Generally, pin 1 (red) is 5V, pin 4 (yel) is 12V, and
   116	           pins 2&3 (blk) are Ground.) The Installation Kit may
   117	           refer to a jumper on pin 34, but this can be ignored.
   118	
   119	           Now, the only modification to the drive can be made.
   120	           On the Installation Kit PC Board, a Jumper must be 
   121	           soldered between pin 2 and pin 28 of the Drive Con-
   122	           nector.(This is the one that actually connects to
   123	           the Disk Drive. It is identical in pin layout to the
   124	           Std connector, with pin 2 on the top left as you look
   125	           at it.) This connects the Media Change signal on pin
   126	           2 to the Write Protect signal.(Thanks to Analog2 for
   127	           pointing me in the right direction on this one.) 
   128	           These are both open collector, active low signals, and
   129	           can be safely wired together.(wired or configuration)
   130	
   131	           This should be all that has to be done to make the
   132	           drive work. Simply plug the cable into the OUT con-
   133	           nector of the first drive or the 1040, and away you
   134	           go.
   135	
   136	           If you have a 520 and want this to be drive A, the
   137	           procedure is the same, except DO NOT CUT THE CABLE
   138	           IN HALF. Instead, strip a 3-4 in. section in the
   139	           center of the cable, Cut and unweave 1/2 of the 
   140	           shield. Lead the wires over the Vstuds as before,
   141	           but cut the wires from the Atari connector pins 5&
   142	           6.(computer end) Pin 5 wire is connected to the Std
   143	           connector pin 10 and pin 6 wire is connected to the
   144	           remaining end of pin 5.(The part that will go to the
   145	           second drive.) This brings the ds1 signal to the
   146	           ds0 pin on the second drive, just like Atari does it.
   147	           You can cut off the remaining pin 6 wire if you like, 
   148	           since it doesn't get used. Don't forget to attach the
   149	           shield to the odd number connector pins.
   150	
   151	           If you have understood and followed my directions, the
   152	           drive should function properly. If not, there is not 
   153	           much that can cause damage. My version will read and
   154	           format and write to double and single sided disks 
   155	           without any problems. If you encounter any difficulty,
   156	           I can be contacted through Delphi as JIMSL or Com-
   157	           puserve No. 72257,1613.
