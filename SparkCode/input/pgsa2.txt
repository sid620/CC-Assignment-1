    21	INTRODUCTION:        
    22	 
    23	 The Power Glove Serial Adapter, Revision 2 (hereto referred to as
    24	the PGSA II, or "the box") provides the microcomputer user with a means to
    25	interface the Mattel Manufactured Nintendo PowerGlove (tm) to his or her
    26	personal system.  The PowerGlove is a 3 dimensional input device capable of
    27	providing the user with X,Y, and Z coordinates to help facilitate 3-D 
    28	software requirements.  In addition, the PGSA II allows the users similar
    29	access to the SEGA(tm) 3-D Shutter Glasses.  With both of these capabilities 
    30	on-board the PGSA II, low cost Virtual Realism and 3 dimensional visualization
    31	systems are a reality.  
    32	
    33	HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
    34	 
    35	 The only hardware requirement is the ability for a user's
    36	system to accept standard RS-232C (EIA-232D) serial data at a bit rate of
    37	9600 bps with 1 stop bit, no parity, and 8 data bits.  The PGSA II comes
    38	with a "standard" female DB25 connector commonly used for RS-232 devices,
    39	although users can change that restriction by using adapters.  The PGSA II
    40	allows the users to gather input from the PowerGlove without having to
    41	know the specifics of the input device at the hardware level.  The interface
    42	box provides all the necessary buffering and translation, so that the user 
    43	can receive up-to-date information on the position of the PowerGlove and  
    44	control the SEGA glasses.
    45	
    46	AVAILABILITY:
    47	
    48	 Although the PGSA II is currently under development, finished units
    49	will not ship until early in August.  This information is provided for 
    50	potential customers eager to learn more about the use of 3 dimensional
    51	input and output devices, as well as potential software authors drawn to
    52	the idea of using 3 dimensional devices in future product releases.  There
    53	is an installed base of software for the so-called "parallel interface" which
    54	uses the processor on the host computer and special lines on the printer port 
    55	of the host computer to provide a subset of the functions available in the
    56	PGSA II.  While the "parallel" interface has been refined considerably for
    57	users of newer IBM compatible systems, other machine owners have been less
    58	fortunate.  The PGSA II hopes to solve these problems when available.
    59	
    60	REQUEST FOR MORE INFORMATION:
    61	
    62	 The Internet News Group SCI.VIRTUAL-WORLDS receives up-to-date
    63	information about progress in the areas of 3-D viewing and input devices.
    64	Many readers of this newsgroup, names being too numerous to mention, can 
    65	provides answers to common questions related to the use and development of
    66	devices such as the PGSA II and appropriate software.  Alternately, This
    67	author can be reached at the internet and land address found at the closing
    68	of this document.  Although in its initial stages, low-cost virtual reality
    69	is fast becoming a real reality.
    70	
    71	SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:
    72	
    73	 Although no installed base for the PGSA II exists, it can easily
    74	emulate the Menelli Interface, designed as a project by Ron Menelli, or the 
    75	Abrahms Gentile Entertainment, Inc. (AGE) PGSA Interface.  This provides the 
    76	user with a means to utilize the new inteface box, while waiting for software
    77	to be written that will fully support the new box.  In the area of SEGA   
    78	support, the PGSA II will work with all currently available software 
    79	utilizing RTS control or the newer RTS/DTR control designed by Glen Harris.
    80	
    81	PRODUCT CONTENTS:
    82	
    83	 The PGSA II system comes standard with adapters to interface 1        
    84	Nintendo PowerGlove and one pair of SEGA shutter glasses.  The system 
    85	terminates with a connector that will accept a standard RS-232 DB-25 male
    86	plug. A complete set of documentation will also be included.  This 
    87	documentation will explian how to use the interface, how to program the 
    88	interface in common languages, how to troubleshoot the interface should
    89	anything go awry, and how to enhance the unit.  The documentation will also
    90	detail the theory involved.  A demonstration disk containing sample programs
    91	and help files will be included, provided the user states his current system
    92	type.
    93	
    94	WHAT IS NOT INCLUDED:
    95	
    96	 The user must supply his own means for power generation.  A jack has
    97	been included to allow hookup of many low-cost "brick" power units, commonly
    98	referred to as "battery eliminators".  The sytem can be powered by any AC or
    99	DC voltage from 6 volts up to 35 volts.  The user must also supply the needed
   100	PowerGlove and/or SEGA glasses.  The system will function perfectly without
   101	the SEGA glasses installed, but the unit will operate the SEGA glasses in 
   102	only 2 of 4 modes of operation if the glasses are installed alone.  Potential
   103	customers are discouraged from buying this unit solely to operate the
   104	SEGA Glasses.  If the user has an RS-232 interface incompatible with the DB-25
   105	connector, he or she can either buy the unit themselves, or purchase it from
   106	SIGARCH. 
   107	
   108	ACCESSORIES:
   109	
   110	 Users who wish to enhance the operation of the PGSA II may do so in
   111	many ways.  Although the current version of the controlling software does
   112	not support it, the current hardware and future versions of the software will
   113	include support for up to 2 PowerGloves.  Also, future versions of the 
   114	controlling software will include support for one or more Nintendo U-Force
   115	controllers, a device similar in operation to the PowerGlove.  
   116	
   117	SOFTWARE UPGRADES:
   118	
   119	 Registered owners of of the PGSA II will receive updates to the 
   120	controller code as they are finished, along with documentation and programs
   121	to load the new code into the interface.  The interface is 
   122	"field-programmable", which means that updates to the controller code can be
   123	made by the end user using special programs.  The user will also be notified  
   124	of other products produced by SIGARCH.
   125	
   126	MISCELLANEOUS:
   127	
   128	 The PGSA II has been made with flexibility in mind.  The user can
   129	select the following options on the standard board:
   130	
   131	 Control SEGA Glasses using RTS direct control.
   132	 Control SEGA Glasses using RTS/DTR direct control.
   133	 Control SEGA Glasses using interface control.
   134	 Select 1 PowerGlove active.
   135	 Select 2 PowerGloves active.
   136	 Select On-board SEGA voltage generation (for 6-9 volt power supplies)
   137	 Select User supplied SEGA voltage gen.  (optional for 10+ V supplies)
   138	 Select High or Low initial baud rate. 
   139	
   140	Plus, there are 3 configuration options for users with nonstandard RS-232
   141	requirements. 
   142	
   143	COST:
   144	
   145	 SIGARCH is still evaluating the retail price for these units, but
   146	factors tentativly support a price of $85.00. SIGARCH cannot guarantee
   147	this price until all evaluation has been finished.  SIGARCH is looking
   148	into the possibility of offering kits of the PGSA II at a reduced price, but
   149	the decision has not been discussed thoroughly.  Note that cost will largely
   150	be determined by the number of people committing to purchase a box upon
   151	manufacture, since SIGARCH will take prepaid orders for the units. A base
   152	of 50 purchasers is required before final production can start.
