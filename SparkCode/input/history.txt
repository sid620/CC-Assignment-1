     5	               WHERE WE'VE BEEN WITH NO IDEA WHERE WE'RE GOING! 
     6	
     7	       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
     8	
     9	       In the beginning . . . 
    10	
    11	       Computing or calculating by machine began in the middle east 
    12	       with the use of pegs or stones in trays or channels. The 
    13	       Babylonians developed the idea of stone or bead counters into 
    14	       the more modern abacus - modern in the sense that the abacus is 
    15	       still in use today and in the hands of an experienced operator 
    16	       can calculate results faster than a computer!  
    17	
    18	       The beauty of the abacus is its simplicity in construction and 
    19	       operation. Inexpensive beads of stone or wood and a simple frame 
    20	       make up the abacus and the uneducated could quickly be trained 
    21	       in its use. 
    22	
    23	       In the 8th and 9th centuries we note the rise of the Arabic 
    24	       numeral system which slowly spread through Europe and the then 
    25	       civilized world. Although a superior calculating system, Arabic 
    26	       numerals required the user to understand the more complicated 
    27	       numerical theory associated with the system. 
    28	
    29	       By the early 1600's Napier (often associated with the 
    30	       development of logarithms and their practical application) 
    31	       introduced a series of rods which could be used for 
    32	       multiplication - a crude slide rule system. 
    33	
    34	       Soon, ever more complicated "calculating engines" or primitive 
    35	       mechanical computing devices appeared. One example is the 
    36	       complex Pascaline invented by Blaise Pascal. 
    37	
    38	       By 1791 the stage was set. Babbage, an English mathematician and 
    39	       inventor with the help of Ada Byron (daughter of lord Byron, the 
    40	       famous poet) developed the ideas for two mechanical calculators 
    41	       or "number engines." The Difference Engine was a device to solve 
    42	       polynomial equations by the methods of differences. The 
    43	       Analytical Engine (which was never built)) was designed as a 
    44	       general computing device. Both were mechanical in concept using 
    45	       gears, rods and cams to perform calculations. Unfortunately 
    46	       neither machine was built since the tooling and machining 
    47	       technology of the day was imprecise and could not construct the 
    48	       accurate parts needed. 
    49	
    50	       However the models and planning of Babbage and Byron did lead to 
    51	       important preliminary computing concepts still in use today. As 
    52	       an aside, we should note from the work of Babbage and Byron that 
    53	       computing even in its infancy was strongly influenced by BOTH 
    54	       women and men - let's face it, computing is NOT gender specific! 
    55	
    56	       Next we jump to the United States. By 1880 a problem had arisen 
    57	       with the United States census. By that time, it took 7 years to 
    58	       process all of the information gathered by the Census Bureau 
    59	       since all tabulation was done by hand on paper. It was assumed 
    60	       that the 1890 census might take 10 to 12 years to tabulate. 
    61	       Clearly a better method was needed to crunch the volume of 
    62	       numbers and data. A public competition was held to produce a 
    63	       better indexing or mechanical system to tabulate future census 
    64	       results. Herman Hollerith, a census employee, handily won by 
    65	       suggesting the use of punch cards and a form of punch card 
    66	       reader which tabulated the results in six weeks. Hollerith, wise 
    67	       in the ways of computing devices and seeing a good opportunity 
    68	       went on to found the Tabulating Machine Company (later changed 
    69	       to IBM). Hollerith might be thus thought of as our first 
    70	       computer entrepreneur! 
    71	
    72	       The advent of World War II provided the impetus for the 
    73	       development of more refined computing devices. The Mark I was an 
    74	       electromechanical device using relays. IBM built that computer 
    75	       for the Navy. Later, the Colossus was built for the British and 
    76	       used for wartime code breaking of German radio transmissions. 
    77	       The ABC (Atanasoff-Berry Computer) was constructed at Iowa State 
    78	       and was the first fully electronic digital computer. 
    79	
    80	       Admiral Grace Hopper, known as "Amazing Grace" to some, was a 
    81	       naval officer and pioneer in the field of computer programming 
    82	       during the 1940's and 50's. An innovative and fundamental 
    83	       thinker, she recognized that computers could be used for 
    84	       business applications - a pioneering insight beyond the then 
    85	       conventional use of computers for scientific and military 
    86	       applications. Her programming language called "Flowmatic" later 
    87	       evolved into COBOL, the most common and still popular language 
    88	       for programming business software. She died in 1992 and is
    89	       buried in Arlington National Cemetery. 
    90	       
    91	       Computing science continued to evolve rapidly . . . 
    92	
    93	       Eniac was the most famous of the early computers and contained 
    94	       18,000 vacuum tubes and was used by the Army for ballistics 
    95	       calculations. 
    96	
    97	       Edvac was the first stored memory computing device which did 
    98	       away with rewiring tasks associated with changing computer 
    99	       programs and represented a true computer breakthrough. This 
   100	       first generation of machines running from roughly 1951 through 
   101	       1958 featured computers characterized by the use of radio type 
   102	       vacuum tubes. But the pace was increasing . . . 
   103	
   104	       Second generation machines such as the famous Univac were 
   105	       designed as true general or universal purpose machines and could 
   106	       process both alphabetic and numeric problems and data. Punch 
   107	       cards still formed the major input path to the machines of this 
   108	       era and all programming was done in complex low level machine 
   109	       language commands. 
   110	
   111	       By 1959 with the invention of the transistor, computers began to 
   112	       shrink in size and cost and operate faster and more dependably 
   113	       than the huge vacuum tube models. Programming languages began to 
   114	       feature English-like instructions rather than cumbersome machine 
   115	       code or assembly language. Fortran and Cobol are two modern 
   116	       "high level" languages developed during this period and still in 
   117	       use today.              
   118	
   119	       In many respects, the personal computer industry began in 1974 
   120	       when the Intel corporation introduced a CPU integrated circuit 
   121	       chip named the 8080. It contained 4,500 transistors and could 
   122	       address 64K of memory through a 16 bit data bus. The 8080 was 
   123	       the integrated circuit brain behind the early MITS Altair 
   124	       personal computer which fired popular interest in home and small 
   125	       business computing when it appeared on the July 1975 cover of 
   126	       Popular Electronics Magazine. The first MITS Altair contained no 
   127	       keyboard or monitor, only crude LED lights and tiny flip 
   128	       switches to facilitate programming. 
   129	
   130	       Four years later in 1978 Intel released the 8086 chip which had 
   131	       a tenfold increase in performance over the 8080 chip. When IBM 
   132	       began the design phase of the first desktop PC units in 1980 and 
   133	       1981, they chose the cousin of the 8086, the Intel 8088 chip, to 
   134	       power the first PC which was designed for modest corporate use 
   135	       but quickly exploded in popularity due to an excellent design, 
   136	       spectacular keyboard and openess to upgrade by the addition of 
   137	       "plug in" boards and cards. 
   138	
   139	       Early IBM PC computers retained a link with the past by allowing 
   140	       the addition of a small "Baby Blue" circuit board which could 
   141	       run software programs based on the then dominant CPM operating 
   142	       system. 
   143	
   144	       Finally we come to the present decade . . . 
   145	
   146	       August 1981. Original IBM PC (personal computer) introduced. Has 
   147	       options for monochrome and CGA color display. Receives generally 
   148	       good reviews and acceptance by business users and a few home 
   149	       users. Original DOS version 1.0 released which supported only 
   150	       single sided disks (160K capacity). Later version 1.1 corrected 
   151	       bugs (problems) in the DOS programming code and provided double 
   152	       sided disks (320K capacity), and faster disk access, date and 
   153	       time stamping and better serial communications. 
   154	
   155	       August 1982. Monochrome resolution of PC screen increased with 
   156	       introduction of the Hercules graphics card circuit. Combined 
   157	       with the LOTUS 123 spreadsheet, the IBM PC was now a hot choice 
   158	       for corporate computing. 
   159	
   160	       November 1982. Compaq portable arrives. First IBM clone on the 
   161	       market. The IBM PC standard is growing in popularity. Clone 
   162	       makers start to copy the PC in earnest. Software companies such 
   163	       as Phoenix technologies prepare BIOS and SYS programs which run 
   164	       the same as the IBM BIOS program without the copyright violation 
   165	       which every clone computer tries to avoid. BIOS stands for basic 
   166	       input and output system and is the core software essential to 
   167	       keyboard, disk and screen input/output. The BIOS is considered 
   168	       legally protected IBM software code, but can be simulated (or 
   169	       emulated) closely by a clever programmer in an attempt to do the 
   170	       same job, without using exactly the same programming code. 
   171	
   172	       March 1983. IBM introduces the PC XT (increased memory and hard 
   173	       drive capability). DOS version 2.0 released. This second DOS 
   174	       version includes hard drive capability, filter commands (sort, 
   175	       find, more), and a new floppy format system for 360K capacity 
   176	       per floppy. IBM bios code upgraded. 
   177	
   178	       October 1983. IBM PC JR released. Market disappointment for that 
   179	       IBM entry into the home market with the underpowered PC JR. The 
   180	       larger IBM PC standard is rapidly growing as the standard for 
   181	       personal computers and clones. 
   182	
   183	       March 1984. IBM PC portable introduced. Portable clones already 
   184	       on the market with small but growing success. 
   185	
   186	       August 1984. IBM PC AT machine arrives. More power, a new 
   187	       processor (Intel 80286). New screen display standard (EGA). Also 
   188	       new version of DOS 3.0. This version of DOS now takes into 
   189	       account the AT high density floppy drive (1.2 meg or million 
   190	       characters of capacity), read only files and a new disk write 
   191	       system for better file recovery in case of errors. Shortly 
   192	       thereafter, DOS 3.1 addresses file sharing. 
   193	
   194	       November 1985. Microsoft windows graphic display environment 
   195	       released. NEC multisync monitor is released. 
   196	
   197	       December 1985. DOS 3.2 supports the new 3.5 inch 720K diskettes. 
   198	       DOS now addresses up to 32MB on a single hard disk. 
   199	
   200	       April 1986. Older IBM PC standard model discontinued for newer 
   201	       models. IBM PC convertible model is released. 
   202	
   203	       September 1986. Compaq jumps the gun on IBM with release of new 
   204	       (80386) processor computer with more power than the PC AT. 
   205	
   206	       April 1987. IBM PS/2 models 30, 50 and 60 released. DOS 3.3 
   207	       released. VGA video standard arrives. IBM blesses the new 3.5 
   208	       inch minifloppy already in use on Apple Macintosh computers by 
   209	       offering that format on IBM machines. 1.44MB format is supported 
   210	       for high density floppy users. OS/2 operating system announced.
   211	
   212	       August 1987. Microsoft windows version 2.0 arrives. 
   213	
   214	       November 1988. DOS 4.01 released which includes a shell menu 
   215	       interface system. This release of DOS, largely developed by IBM, 
   216	       generally ignored due to poor performance and large memory 
   217	       requirements. Many users stick with DOS 3.3.
   218	
   219	       1988 Laptop computers, smaller versions of desktop computers, 
   220	       are sold in large volumes. Size as well as features become 
   221	       issues in computer sales. 
   222	
   223	       1990 Microsoft introduces Windows version 3.0 which includes a 
   224	       superb graphical user interface (GUI) display for the PC. 
   225	       Improves on earlier versions of Windows. Using software is more 
   226	       productive with multiple graphical software windows and the 
   227	       possibility of jumping between several software tasks operating 
   228	       on screen. But windows can only run acceptably on more expensive 
   229	       "high end" machines such as those containing the 386DX or 386SX 
   230	       chip. For many users in small offices or home offices, Windows 
   231	       may not be a necessity where simple DOS applications offer 
   232	       affordable functionality on low priced PC's not equipped to run 
   233	       Windows applications.
   234	
   235	       1991 Laptop computers, portable FAX systems, and cellular 
   236	       portable phone technology allow computers to function anywhere 
   237	       on the go for a practical "portable office" concept. Still newer 
   238	       "palmtop" computers about the size of portable calculators now 
   239	       offer full IBM compatable functionality.
   240	
   241	       June 1991. DOS 5.0 is released which includes excellent new 
   242	       features including an improved menu interface, full-screen 
   243	       editor which improves on the Edlin editor, some limited task-
   244	       swapping abilities, unformat/unerase utility, improved Basic 
   245	       interpreter, and ability to load system files to High Memory on 
   246	       machines having at least 1MB for improved performance and 
   247	       increased conventional memory availability for primary applications. 
   248	       DOS 5.0 is seen to be a major and highly necessary update to the 
   249	       PC operating system. Generally receives good reviews from computer 
   250	       trade press.
   251	       
   252	       The future? Difficult to predict, but the consensus of industry 
   253	       observers is that the IBM PS/2 computers will migrate into the 
   254	       office scene while many home and home/office users will stay 
   255	       with older XT computers and AT models. Best entry level computer 
   256	       system at this time is judged by many experts to the a 386SX PC
   257	       system which allows many types of software both current and 
   258	       future to work reliably. Prices continue to tumble on AT and XT 
   259	       compatibles ($400 to $500 range) and AT clones ($700 to 
   260	       $900 range). The operating system for AT and higher class machines 
   261	       (using 80286/80386 processors) is called OS/2 but requires more 
   262	       memory and the 80286/80386 processor found only in higher 
   263	       priced computers. OS/2 or Windows may slowly replace the older 
   264	       DOS system, but for many users of home and home/office machines 
   265	       not needing LAN networks (many computers talk to each other and 
   266	       share data), the DOS standard will live a long time. The Microsoft 
   267	       Windows 3.0 system may delay the acceptance of OS/2 for several 
   268	       years. 
   269	    
   270	       In general expect things to happen faster, computers to become 
   271	       still smaller and prices to descend still further! Graphical 
   272	       user interfaces or GUI's will gradually become the standard so 
   273	       that users can point and click at small icon pictures and lists 
   274	       of tasks on screen to accomplish the work at hand rather than 
   275	       fight with terse and cryptic commands. Computing will become a 
   276	       standard in many small and home offices owing to the incredible 
   277	       power, accuracy and affordablity of personal computers. Laptop 
   278	       computers and even smaller palmtop computers will become new 
   279	       standards. Computers and modems linked by wireless cellular 
   280	       radio/telephone technology allow a single computer user the 
   281	       power of "large office computing" on the go from anywhere in the 
   282	       world! Shareware software will make strong inroads into the 
   283	       market as users evaluate commercial "high priced" software 
   284	       against user support "low cost" shareware software.
