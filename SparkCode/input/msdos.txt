    26	If you can't afford the big cluster size on large hd's (32k...)
    27	slice'em up with fdisk into two, three partitions.
    28	
    29	There can exist ONE file only in each cluster.
    30	
    31	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
    32	
    33	If you experience files with spaces in them (20h),  you might discover that is
    34	isn't so easy to delete them. Let's say we have a file called "game 94.exe".
    35	First rename it to something deleteable.
    36	
    37	ren game?94.exe game_94.exe
    38	del game_94.exe
    39	
    40	Of course, you might have to delete any files that blocks for a rename,
    41	like "game!94.exe", etc.....
    42	
    43	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
    44	
    45	If [program-name] *.*
    46	don't work, use
    47	
    48	for %a in (*.*) [prog-name] %a		;or %%a for batch files (?)
    49	
    50	instead. If you don't need *.*, use the wildcard that suits your problem...
    51	
    52	-This is called a FOR loop.
    53	
    54	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
    55	
    56	If you ever use nonstandard floppy-disks and get hardware errors on them,
    57	you might discover that you can't run "Norton Disk Doctor" or another
    58	similar disk-error correcting utility on them.
    59	
    60	The trick is to either use one of these solutions in your config.sys:
    61	
    62		* Driver.sys and define a new logical drive
    63	-NOT recommended because a LOT of programs fuck up with this driver.
    64	
    65		* Drivparm= . This parameter redefines your physical drive, and
    66	sets new information. HIGHLY recommended, works virtually everywhere!
    67	
    68	SYNTAX:
    69	
    70	drivparm= /D:[number] (/C) /F:[factor] /H:[heads] (/I) (/N) /S:[sectors]
    71		  /T:[tracks]
    72	
    73	D	-	represents logical drive number, A:=0, B:=1, C:=2, and so on.
    74			0-255, but real limit is drive Z.
    75	
    76	C	-	Means that the drive has CHANGE LINE SUPPORT, which means
    77			that the drive detects if you remove and and insert a disk.
    78			5.¬ usually doesn't have Change Line Support, but 3.« usually
    79			does.
    80	
    81	F	-	Form factor. Says what true device the new device should
    82			emulate.
    83			0-	160/180k, or 320/260k disk.
    84			1-	1.2 MB disk.
    85			2-	720k 3.5 inch disk.
    86			5-	Hard disk.
    87			6-	Tape Drive.
    88			7-	1.44 MB 3.5 inch disk.
    89			8-	Read/Write optical disk.
    90			9-	2.88 MB 3.5 inch disk.
    91	
    92			The default is a 3.5 inch 720 kb disk.
    93	
    94	H	-	Maximum head number. From 1 to 99. Default is 2.
    95	
    96	I	-	Specifies that the device is 3.5 inch electrically-compatible.
    97			Set this switch if your BIOS does not support 3.5 inch drives.
    98	
    99	N	-	Specifies a non-removable block device.
   100	
   101	S	-	Sectors per track. From 1 to 99. Default is 9.
   102			(In most cases, if you set the track to the highest case
   103			 in which you may experience, the device will usually still
   104			 detect a less-sectored storage device, and properly use it)
   105			(Then again, it might not...hehehe)
   106	
   107	T	-	Number of tracks PER SIDE of block device. From 1 to 999.
   108			same ()'s goes as over.
   109	
   110	This parameter can also be used to specify a 3.«" disk drive in a system
   111	which bios cannot handle that.....
   112	
   113	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
   114	
   115	At least set
   116	
   117	c:\dos\mode con rate=32 delay=1
   118	
   119	if you don't have the utility to set the rate higher, this is a setting
   120	to live with....
   121	
   122	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   123	
   124	An alternate and better solution, but more technical, is to create a TSR that
   125	stuffs more characters into the keyboardbuffer whenever a key is pressed.
   126	
   127	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   128	
   129	If you want an extended keyboardbuffer, it is really easy to create a program
   130	that changes the buffer to point to the USUALLY empty space between
   131	0200 and 0300...
   132	
   133	Note: USUALLY!
   134	
   135	To help you with this, I have included a program in asm for you. If you have
   136	no compilator, don't worry, because I have also compilated it. You can find
   137	most info in the buffermv.1st file.
   138	
   139	The asm, exe, and 1st files lies in the EXTRAS directory.
   140	
   141	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
   142	
   143	if the install program is stupid enough, use subst to SUBSTitute drive
   144	a: for a directory on your hd. This way you can install MUCH faster...
   145	
   146	Use: subst a: [drive]:\[full path]
   147	
   148	use a program to shell to dos between installing the disks, or just stuff all
   149	the disks into the directory
   150	
   151	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
   152	
   153	use a boot-menu if possible
   154	[dos 6.0 and higher]
   155	
   156	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
   157	
   158	of course, to save memory, the start of your config.sys would look something
   159	like this:
   160	
   161	stacks=0,0	;Unless you REALLY need stacks, keep them out!
   162			;You can use a multiple-boot if you only need stacks
   163			 for one program
   164	fcbs=1		;No-one uses fcbs's anymore, keep them low
   165	buffers=20,8	;Only real impact on small&slow hd's and floppies
   166			 Turn higher if one of your devices tend to slow down
   167			 The second number is the size of the secondary buffer.
   168	lastdrive=c[d?]	;dos sets lastdrive at one drive more than you need.
   169			 When you don't planning on installing devices between
   170			 reboots, set lastdrive to your REAL last drive
   171	files=20	;20 is enough for wp, which is about the only program
   172			 that use so many. You can usually live with 10, (or 8)
   173			 Other programs, like bbs'es need more.... If you
   174			 Task-switch, you might need much more!
   175	
   176	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
   177	
   178	Dos has several bugs you don't want to run in to. Be avare of command lines
   179	very long (, like 250 chars), which in addition to some keycodes hangs dos.
   180	A cold boot is the only cure. You might want to avoid pressing a lot of ctrl
   181	codes simoultanesly. (Who does that really? Me? Guess so.....)
   182	
   183	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
   184	
   185	Use smaller characters in dos sessions!
   186	Using a smaller characters generates a larger -real estate-, and gives you
   187	easier dos management. Normally, virtually everyone can use:
   188	
   189	[config.sys]
   190	device=c:\dos\ansi.sys
   191	
   192	[autoexec.bat]              ;or another file containing the commands you
   193	c:\dos\mode con lines=50    ;normally would have had in that file 
   194	
   195	Other people, like me, would use a tsr to give you 80*60 or 100*40, or
   196	maybe something like the 160*64! (1mb, 1280*1024)
   197	
   198	Generally, I use 80*60 for normal dos management, and 100*40 for reading
   199	text files.
   200	
   201	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
   202	
   203	If your hd is as complicated as mine, with 600+ directories, 10000-20000
   204	files, and tree paths as big as 15 levels deep, you WANT to create additional
   205	drives with subst.
   206	
   207	Let's say that your main and last drive is d:
   208	Then you really want to:
   209	subst e: d:\
   210	subst f: d:\
   211	
   212	and so on.....
   213	
   214	If you can't afford the small memory the additional drives costs you,
   215	and you only have one Floppy Drive, replace b: which is not used, and only
   216	takes memory anyway...
   217	
   218	this way you can be in
   219	d:\main\progs\main\dos\util\data\sound\players\dmp
   220	and copy a file, let's say readme.now to e: (which is really d:!)
   221	e:\second\datas\second\copy2\temp\delme\x\x\x\
   222	
   223	then only a {copy d:readme.now .} is required!!!!!!!!
   224	
   225	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   226	
   227	Windows notice!
   228	
   229	Since windows is NOT compatible with subst, do as follows:
   230	
   231	1.	Rename WIN.COM to WINFILE.COM
   232	2.	Make a bat file {win.bat} containing this:
   233	
   234		subst d: /D		;and e: b: f:, if you have more that one
   235					;substed drive...
   236	
   237		c:\windows\winfile.com
   238	
   239		subst d: d:\		;restore the subst'es to the original
   240					;configuration
   241	
   242	This works fine with me, and is as far as I know, the best solution to this
   243	problem... There IS a way to use SUBSTed drives in windows, but I will not
   244	explain this here.
   245	
   246	You might want to restore your video configuration, since windows usually
   247	fucks up any exotic video mode. (like 80*60, which windows returns to 80*50)
   248	
   249	------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   250	
   251	You CAN however create subst'ed drives within a dos-window. The subst'ed
   252	drives will not be shared among the windows.
   253	
   254	נננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננננ
