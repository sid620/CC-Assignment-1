     8	       No other topic seems to inspire more opinion and comment than 
     9	       the proper care and handling of rechargeable laptop and notebook 
    10	       computer batteries. Should you slow or fast charge them? What is 
    11	       the true life of a rechargeable battery after which it must be 
    12	       disposed? Do rechargeable batteries have a "memory" effect? Can 
    13	       nickel-cadmium batteries explode when charging or discharging? 
    14	
    15	       Although this tutorial may seem technical in places, try to read 
    16	       ALL of it since battery power may be your only source of laptop 
    17	       power on many occasions. 
    18	
    19	       For many portable computers a variety of rechargeable battery 
    20	       options exist today. But frequently it comes down to the old 
    21	       standby: nickel-cadmium batteries. Ubiquitous in consumer 
    22	       electronic items such as shavers, flashlights, toothbrushes and 
    23	       radios, nickel-cadmiums or "nicads" are a reasonable balance of 
    24	       power, cost and weight and are used by many computer 
    25	       manufacturers as the portable power source of choice. Let's 
    26	       scratch the surface on the topic since there is QUITE A BIT the 
    27	       manufacturer doesn't tell you about nicads.... 
    28	       
    29	       Glance at the following chemical equation which is at the heart 
    30	       of the nickel-cadmium cell reaction. Don't get overly anxious 
    31	       because high school chemistry was not your favorite subject. 
    32	       We'll take things slowly.... 
    33	       
    34	                           <-----
    35	       Cd + 2 NiOOH + 2 KOH -----> Cd(OH) + 2NiO + 2 KOH 
    36	                                        2 
    37	        
    38	       In this highly simplified reaction sequence, electricity is 
    39	       generated when the reaction proceeds in the direction of the 
    40	       right pointing arrow, the discharge cycle. If the reaction 
    41	       proceeds in the left direction the cell is charging. 
    42	       
    43	       In simplest terms, a nicad cell (a battery is constructed of 
    44	       several cells hooked together) has a positively charged plate of 
    45	       nickelic hydroxide and a negative plate of metallic cadmium. The 
    46	       liquid between the positive and negatives plates which 
    47	       facilitates this chemical reaction is usually a dilute solution 
    48	       of potassium hydroxide - similar to lye or the Draino (tm) 
    49	       solution your pour down the sink to clean your plumbing. When 
    50	       discharging and thus producing electricity, the nickelic 
    51	       hydroxide is reduced to nickelous hydroxide as hydroxyl ions 
    52	       from the potassium hydroxide electrolyte combine with the 
    53	       cadmium metal of the negative plate of the cell to form cadmium 
    54	       hydroxide. Cadmium is oxidized when this happens and electrons 
    55	       are provided into the external circuit, such as your laptop 
    56	       computer. 
    57	
    58	       When charging, the process reverses and hydroxyl ions combine 
    59	       with the nickel which accepts electrons from the external 
    60	       charging circuit. Notice that the electrolyte, potassium 
    61	       hydroxide is unchanged with two atoms or units produced on both 
    62	       sides of the chemical equation whether charging or discharging. 
    63	       This is why you do not need to add more water to a nicad battery 
    64	       which operates as a sealed reaction container. It regenerates 
    65	       its electrolyte in both the charge and discharge cycles. 
    66	       
    67	       All of this is an ideal nicad cell. The real world of computers 
    68	       and rechargeable batteries is not quite that simple. The first 
    69	       SERIOUS item to consider is that all nicad cells and batteries 
    70	       generate gas during both the charging, and to a lesser extent, 
    71	       discharging cycle. 
    72	       
    73	       During recharging, oxygen gas is generated at the positive 
    74	       electrode while hydrogen gas is produced at the negative 
    75	       electrode. In other types of rechargeable cells, a standard lead 
    76	       acid car battery for example, these gasses are usually released 
    77	       into the atmosphere. The nicad cell does not have this luxury 
    78	       since it must operate cleanly and with minimum release of gasses 
    79	       or liquids. To minimize hydrogen gas release, nicad cells 
    80	       usually have an oversized negative electrode which tends to 
    81	       reabsorb hydrogen gas. In addition oxygen is recycled by 
    82	       combining with metallic cadmium to produce cadmium oxide. So 
    83	       called "fast-charging" nicad cells prevent gas buildup and 
    84	       dissipate some of the heat generated during the quick charge 
    85	       cycle by further enlarging the electrodes. Heat and gas buildup 
    86	       is thus controlled and kept to tolerable limits in quick charge 
    87	       nicads. 
    88	
    89	       The first of several lessons which can be derived from this 
    90	       technical discussion is that the buildup of hydrogen and oxygen 
    91	       gas during the charging cycle is normally dissipated unless HIGH 
    92	       recharging rates are attempted or unusually high temperatures 
    93	       are produced. If the nicad cell is charged at abnormally high 
    94	       rates the oxygen gas cannot dissipate and will EXPLOSIVELY 
    95	       rupture the cell. 
    96	       
    97	       A safety system of sorts exists within the design structure of 
    98	       most nicad cells via a pressure venting system - a plastic 
    99	       diaphragm membrane at the top of the cell and small external 
   100	       hole or "exhaust vent." In theory the system safely vents excess 
   101	       pressure and then reseals. In practice the resealing is never 
   102	       complete and the cell may continue to ooze caustic electrolyte 
   103	       or worse the vent may not open soon enough and the cell may 
   104	       simply explode. The vent is really designed for SEVERE charging 
   105	       or discharging rates. In normal use it should NEVER activate; if 
   106	       it does, the battery should be discarded. In cases of massive 
   107	       overcharge or discharge the safety vent is usually too little 
   108	       too late and a dangerous battery explosion takes place anyway. 
   109	       
   110	       During rapid discharge - short circuiting the nicad cell or 
   111	       battery with a piece of wire, for example - gas buildup and heat 
   112	       can be generated and a violent explosion can occur. Another 
   113	       reason why nicads can explosively burst when short circuited and 
   114	       forced to discharge quickly is that they have relatively low 
   115	       "internal resistance" which allows them to dump their electrical 
   116	       capacity quickly and with explosive force. 
   117	       
   118	       Common zinc carbon batteries have a much higher internal 
   119	       resistance and when shorted may produce serious burns to your 
   120	       fingers from melting wire but usually will not explode due to 
   121	       sudden gas buildup. On the point of sudden nicad discharge by 
   122	       short circuit you might be tempted to say that it would be highly 
   123	       unlikely with a portable computer battery. Not so. Tales are 
   124	       told of laptop computer batteries which have exploded when a 
   125	       careless owner shoved several fully charged nicad batteries in a 
   126	       travel case with a set of spare keys. If the keys accidentally 
   127	       contact both the positive and negative poles of the nicad 
   128	       simultaneously, a violent explosion reaction can occur!   
   129	       
   130	       Clearly nicads have some unusual features to be respected and 
   131	       understood. Be careful with charged nicads and treat them as the 
   132	       small "hand grenades" which they can become. Heat, sudden short 
   133	       circuits and high rates of charging are the problem in this 
   134	       area. 
   135	       
   136	       The correct operating temperature for discharging and recharging 
   137	       nicads is from 65F to 85F, according to most manufacturers. High 
   138	       and low ranges of from +32F to 115F are possible as upper and 
   139	       lower limits if nicads MUST be used in extreme environments 
   140	       although discharge and recharge efficiency may be adversely 
   141	       affected - it may require more power to fully charge the battery, 
   142	       charge may not be held for as long on the shelf after charging 
   143	       and finally discharge may not produce a full three or four hour 
   144	       computing session at these severe temperature ranges.
   145	
   146	       Electrically, individual nicad cells - the units which are 
   147	       hooked together to produce the final battery - have a charged 
   148	       voltage of 1.25 volts. Nominally this drops to 1.2 volts under 
   149	       actual discharge use or "load" in the electrical device. 
   150	       Individual cells are strung together in "series" with the 
   151	       positive terminal of one cell touching the negative terminal of 
   152	       the next cell in sequence to raise the voltage to that suitable 
   153	       for the electrical device. Thus two cells hooked in "series" as 
   154	       a battery produce 2 X 1.2 volts = 2.4 volts. Likewise, three 
   155	       cells connected as a battery produce 3.6 volts. By the way, 
   156	       ordinary flashlight batteries of the carbon zinc type have a 
   157	       nominal voltage of 1.5 volts compared to the 1.2 volts of the 
   158	       nicad cell.
   159	
   160	       Nicad batteries have an unusual and highly characteristic 
   161	       discharge behavior which is best described as "a stable 
   162	       discharge plateau then sudden voltage drop." Essentially a fully 
   163	       charged nicad battery provides constant voltage and current 
   164	       until near its exhaustion at which point the voltage SUDDENLY 
   165	       DROPS and the cell is, for practical purposes, completely 
   166	       discharged. 
   167	       
   168	       Compare this to standard carbon zinc and alkaline batteries 
   169	       which gradually drop in voltage and amperage through the 
   170	       discharge cycle of the battery. In use nicads tend to be stable, 
   171	       then die suddenly at the end while conventional non-rechargeable 
   172	       batteries slowly decay in voltage as their power is consumed. 
   173	       One conclusion you might draw from this is that when your 
   174	       portable computer beeps that the nicad battery voltage is 
   175	       nearing exhaustion you literally have only moments of use left! 
   176	       The good news is that nicads produce dependable power through 
   177	       their discharge cycle which is highly desirable with digital 
   178	       data and computer memory devices. 
   179	
   180	       The "memory effect" of nicads is perhaps the most discussed and 
   181	       misunderstood phenomenon associated with nicad cells and 
   182	       batteries. An undesirable and somewhat unique characteristic of 
   183	       nicad batteries that they can develop a "memory" which can 
   184	       decrease either the capacity or voltage of the battery. 
   185	       
   186	       The first type of memory problem in nicads - voltage memory - is 
   187	       caused by sustained charging over many days or months. This 
   188	       memory effect can be accelerated by high ambient temperature 
   189	       extreme duration of charge and high rate of charge. In effect 
   190	       the battery is charged for such a long period of time or at such 
   191	       a high rate or high temperature that the efficiency of the 
   192	       chemical reaction is impaired and proper terminal voltage 
   193	       readings are not achieved. 
   194	       
   195	       In the second, more common "memory capacity" problem, the nicad 
   196	       loses the capability to deliver its full power capacity. One 
   197	       cause of this peculiar memory problem is the FREQUENT PARTIAL 
   198	       DISCHARGE of the battery - use for perhaps 30 minutes - and then 
   199	       full recharge again. In effect the nicad battery "learns" that 
   200	       only part of its capacity is used and over several cycles of 
   201	       "partial depletion and then full recharge" that less then full 
   202	       capacity is needed. It will then be unable to deliver a full 
   203	       two or three hour standard discharge in normal use. Fortunately 
   204	       memory effects are usually temporary and can be reversed.
   205	       
   206	       The chemical basis for these two memory effects is not fully
   207	       understood, but may have to do with obscure oxidation reactions 
   208	       which temporarily coat the internal electrodes of the battery 
   209	       with thin layers of complex non-reactive chemical compounds 
   210	       which can be removed by more fully "exercising" a nicad through a 
   211	       complete charge/discharge cycle. 
   212	
   213	       It is claimed by many manufacturers that this odd memory effect 
   214	       of nicads has been largely eliminated due to modern 
   215	       manufacturing methods. However to some degree this may in fact 
   216	       be a result of newer charging systems and the relatively 
   217	       complete discharge of nicad power by modern laptops. In effect 
   218	       the batteries are charged and discharged in a more appropriate 
   219	       manner by most laptop users so memory effects "appear" to be no 
   220	       longer a problem.
   221	
   222	       Both memory problems - voltage memory and capacity memory - are 
   223	       usually temporary and can be corrected by discharging the 
   224	       battery to or very near its exhaustion point (optimum drawdown 
   225	       voltage is about 1.0 to .9 volts for a standard 1.2 volt nicad) 
   226	       and then recharging it to full capacity. Repeat this discharge-
   227	       recharge cycle from 2 to five times and frequently the nicad 
   228	       will lose its memory for the "partial capacity" and again 
   229	       provide a full 3 or 4 hours of use in most laptops. Actually, 
   230	       frequent FULL discharge and recharge prolongs the life of a 
   231	       nicad. The more you use them the longer they last! 
   232	
   233	       Most folks who want to completely discharge laptop nicads simply 
   234	       leave the computer on until it runs down. A much faster method is 
   235	       to use the following batch file which continuously reads the 
   236	       directory of a disk and writes the contents to a disk file. 
   237	       The continuous disk access drains nicad power much faster. If 
   238	       you are not familiar with batch files, read the batch file 
   239	       tutorial elsewhere in this program. Here's the three line batch 
   240	       file. To stop the batch file at any time press the control and 
   241	       break keys simultaneously. When finished you may wish to erase 
   242	       both the batch file and the small file named "test" which it 
   243	       creates.
   244	
   245	       :start
   246	       dir>test
   247	       goto start
   248	
   249	       As an aside, the newer nickel-hydride batteries used in some 
   250	       laptop and notebook computers do not seem to suffer from memory 
   251	       effects. But these batteries are more expensive and not in 
   252	       common use by most laptop manufacturers.
   253	
   254	       Nicads do eventually fail. And for various reasons. Temporary or 
   255	       partial failure due to memory effects was discussed in the 
   256	       previous paragraphs. 
   257	       
   258	       Permanent failure - usually between 3 to 5 years into the life 
   259	       of a typical nicad can happen due to the growth of 
   260	       characteristic "whiskers" of conducting chemical compounds which 
   261	       effectively bridge the internal gap between the positive and 
   262	       negative electrodes inside the battery. Effectively these small 
   263	       contamination deposits gradually short circuit the battery 
   264	       internally which leads to inability to charge or discharge. Some 
   265	       clever electronic hobbyists build high current "surge" power 
   266	       supplies which can burn open these internal deposits and reopen 
   267	       the gap between positive and negative electrodes. A risky 
   268	       practice at best - given the explosive reputation of nicads - but 
   269	       "zapping" nicads in this manner has been documented as one way 
   270	       to add life to an otherwise dying battery. A risky an usually 
   271	       ill-advised attempt to salvage an otherwise dying battery.
   272	
   273	       A different permanent failure can result from premature loss of the 
   274	       liquid electrolyte from the battery. High temperature and/or 
   275	       high charging rates are usually the cause here. Quick-charge 
   276	       batteries frequently fail due to this problem if their charging 
   277	       circuits are not properly designed. If the top edge of the cell 
   278	       which contains the fail safe pressure release valve has a 
   279	       buildup of white corrosion powder this is probably the residue 
   280	       ot the expelled electrolyte and the cell may be on its way to 
   281	       failure and should be replaced. Note that you can only see this 
   282	       corrosion buildup on the top of the SINGLE nicad cells which are 
   283	       usually encased within a surrounding plastic battery housing. 
   284	       The plastic housing may show little problem externally. 
   285	       Generally, however, the average computer user should not attempt 
   286	       to open the protective plastic case of the battery to examine 
   287	       each cell. If the manufacturer seals several individual nicad 
   288	       cells in a plastic battery container it is for GOOD reason and 
   289	       your own personal safety. As a rule quick charge nicads do not 
   290	       last as long a regular nicads due to heat build up during the 
   291	       charging cycle.
   292	
   293	       So how long will a nicad battery last before complete failure 
   294	       occurs? Manufacturers estimate LOW figures between 500 and 1,000 
   295	       full charge and discharge cycles or about 3 to 5 five years, as 
   296	       noted above. Some nicads have been known to approach 5,000 to 
   297	       10,000 charge and discharge cycles before permanent failure. 
   298	       Excessive quick charging, heat buildup, infrequent use and lack 
   299	       of full charge all contribute to shortened nicad lifespan. 
   300	
   301	       Charging and discharging mathematics... 
   302	
   303	       Charging nicads is generally done automatically by a charging 
   304	       circuit. Two practical pieces of advice: 1) if the battery 
   305	       becomes VERY hot something could be wrong 2) if the manufacturer 
   306	       tells you that the battery will be fully charged after a certain 
   307	       length of time although it can be left charging longer you will 
   308	       probably do the nicad a favor by removing it after full charge 
   309	       is reached. Some clever nicad users simply attach an inexpensive 
   310	       electrical timer - similar to those used to turn lights on and 
   311	       off in the evening - directly to the nicad charger to prevent 
   312	       overcharging. 
   313	       
   314	       Generally nicads have a proper charging rate which depends on 
   315	       each manufacturers recommendation. For standard nicads which are 
   316	       NOT quick charge types the proper slow or "trickle" charge rate 
   317	       is determined by dividing the ampere hour capacity of the 
   318	       battery by 10. For example if a nicad has a total capacity of 1 
   319	       ampere hour, dividing this by ten (1/10) produces a correct 
   320	       trickle charging rate of .1 amps or 100 milliamps. Quick-charge 
   321	       nicads can accept a charge rapidly and the suggested charging 
   322	       rate is determined by dividing the ampere hour capacity of the 
   323	       battery by 3 rather than by 10. These figures represent the 
   324	       trickle charge rate which theoretically means the nicad "could" 
   325	       be safely left charging indefinitely without harm. 
   326	
   327	       Higher efficiency chargers are designed not to simply trickle 
   328	       charge nicads but start a discharged battery at a HIGH rate of 
   329	       charge and then taper the charging current back quickly to the 
   330	       safer "trickle" charge rate once full charge is reached. Usually 
   331	       for regular nicads this "initial surge charge" can be as high as 
   332	       the ampere hour capacity divided by 3. For quick charge nicads 
   333	       this "initial surge charge" can be as high as the ampere hour 
   334	       capacity divided by 1. Obviously these are very high charge 
   335	       rates and are provided to discharged batteries and then 
   336	       quickly discontinued once full charge is approached. Clearly a 
   337	       charging circuit of this sophistication is expensive and may 
   338	       even contain its own microprocessor to sense the discharge level 
   339	       of the nicad and calculate the optimum charge rate, time and 
   340	       trickle charge transition. Since we have previously discussed 
   341	       the adverse affect of heat on nicads it is essential to note 
   342	       that NICADS SHOULD BE CHARGED IN A COOL OR ROOM TEMPERATURE 
   343	       location since they normally generate heat when charged. If you 
   344	       minimize heat buildup - especially during the charging cycle - 
   345	       you will prolong the useful life of your nicad battery. 
   346	       
   347	       Discharging a nicad - especially if you are trying to remove a 
   348	       "memory" problem such as that discussed earlier does NOT mean 
   349	       discharging a cell to zero volts. Usually the correct discharge 
   350	       voltage is about 1.0 volts. This may seem odd when you consider 
   351	       that the fully charged cell has a 1.2 volt reading, but in fact 
   352	       at 1.0 volts a typical nicad cell has released about 90% to 95% 
   353	       of its energy - another eccentric, but predictable behavior of 
   354	       nicads given the rapid "voltage drop off" as they near the end 
   355	       of their three or four hour life in a laptop computer. 
   356	       
   357	       Shelf life. While carbon zinc and alkaline batteries can hold 
   358	       their charge for years, nicads lose their charge relatively 
   359	       quickly. Although it varies, one quick rule of thumb is that a 
   360	       typical fully charged nicad will lose roughly 25% to 35% of full 
   361	       charge in one month. Then another 25% to 35% of THE CHARGE 
   362	       REMAINING in the next month. And so on and so on. Thus if you 
   363	       have several nicad batteries you want to charge for a trip you 
   364	       will be taking in a month, it is probably better to charge ALL 
   365	       OF THEM the final week just before the trip rather than the 
   366	       month before. For want of a better phrase, this might be called 
   367	       "shelf discharge" and is normal with all nicads and has to do 
   368	       with slight electrical leakage and chemical compound decay 
   369	       internally within a charged nicad which sits on a shelf. Cooling 
   370	       or refrigerating the nicad (but NOT freezing) will slow this 
   371	       "shelf discharge" since you are cooling and slowing the 
   372	       breakdown reaction. In fact ALL batteries will last longer when 
   373	       refrigerated until they are used. Simply store them in 
   374	       individual sealed plastic bags (to minimize moisture 
   375	       condensation) and place them in the refrigerator. 
   376	
   377	       And so we conclude with a little summary....
   378	       
   379	       1) Do exactly what the manufacturer suggests for both 
   380	       discharging and recharging a nicad.
   381	       
   382	       2) Keep temperatures - especially during charging - cool or at 
   383	       normal room temperature.
   384	       
   385	       3) Never short circuit a nicad intentionally or accidentally.
   386	       
   387	       4) Try cycling a nicad through several COMPLETE discharge and 
   388	       recharge cycles if it "appears" to be faulty an incapable of 
   389	       operating your equipment for a normal three or four hour 
   390	       operating period. 
   391	       
   392	       5) Remove nicads from charging circuits or discontinue charging 
   393	       when full charge has been reached. 
   394	       
   395	       6) Watch for white flaky corrosion deposits on the upper edge of 
   396	       the cell near the pressure vent this can mean impending cell 
   397	       failure and electrolyte loss.
   398	       
   399	       7) Dispose of permanently defective nicads properly - contact 
   400	       the manufacturer for instructions since cadmium is a dangerous 
   401	       toxic metal and has been banned from many dump sites. Try 
   402	       calling your local city hall and ask who can answer a question 
   403	       about cadmium metal waste disposal. 
   404	       
   405	       8) When the nicad battery power begins to drop near the end of a 
   406	       discharge cycle it will drop VERY QUICKLY due to the rapid 
   407	       characteristic dropoff of nicads. Prepare for laptop shutdown 
   408	       quickly. 
   409	       
   410	       9) Cycle your nicads through a FULL DEEP discharge and FULL 
   411	       COMPLETE recharge frequently - they will last LONGER before you 
   412	       must dispose of them and deliver MORE power when used. 
   413	       
   414	       10) Infrequently used nicads should be charged and discharged at 
   415	       least once or twice every two or three months to prolong their 
   416	       usable lifetime before permanent failure.
   417	       
   418	       11) If your nicads are stated by the manufacturer to be quick 
   419	       charge type, you can probably prolong their life by slow or 
   420	       trickle charging them (if your charger provides that option) 
   421	       since you will minimize heat and gas buildup within the cell. 
   422	       Just because they can be quick charged does not mean they MUST 
   423	       be quick charged. Nicads last longer and deliver more power when 
   424	       not driven to extremes of temperature or overcharging.
