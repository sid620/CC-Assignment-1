     1	DOS Level 1:
     2	
     3	SOFTWARE:  Sets of programs (stored sets of instructions) that govern
     4	the operation of computer system and make the hardware run.  These
     5	programs (instructions) tell the hardware how to perform a particular
     6	task such as word processing, games, database management, etc.
     7	
     8	DOS
     9	---
    10	DOS - Disk Operating System - is a piece of software.  However, it is
    11	different from most software because a computer cannot run without it.  It is
    12	the first piece of software that is installed in RAM every time the computer
    13	is turned on.
    14	
    15	When the user first starts the computer, the DOS files must be available in
    16	either the A drive or on a Hard Disk.  The computer finds the desired DOS
    17	files and automatically loads them into RAM.  This process is often called
    18	"BOOTING" the computer -from the computer pulling itself up by its BOOTstraps.
    19	
    20	TO LOAD DOS
    21	-----------
    22	"Cold" Boot:  Turning the computer on
    23	
    24	"Warm" Boot:  The computer has already been started, but you wish to
    25	              completely "clean-out" RAM and re-load DOS.  This is a
    26	              much faster method of re-starting the computer since it
    27	              skips the usual system checks.  To accomplish, you press
    28	              three keys simultaneously: <CTRL>-<ALT>-<DEL>
    29	
    30	DOS performs 2 functions:
    31	
    32	              1. Links the Hardware
    33	              2. Allows for file management
    34	
    35	We think of most software as enabling us to create something - like a document
    36	or a spreadsheet.  DOS's mission is vital.  Firstly, it enables the hardware
    37	devices to properly communicate with each other.  It is a set of instructions
    38	so that the computer's brain understands how its arms and legs operate
    39	(keyboard, monitor, printers,...).  We take this ability for granted.  It is
    40	like starting a car - many complex systems must work in unison for it to work,
    41	yet we take it for granted that it will start.
    42	
    43	The second function of DOS is also important.  We must have a means to manage
    44	the files that we save on our Floppy Disks or Hard Drives.  There are times
    45	when we wish to copy these files from one disk to another, or erase them, or
    46	determine which files are on a disk.  These tasks are performed often and the
    47	software required to do so is DOS.
    48	
    49	When DOS has been properly loaded from either a Floppy Disk or a Hard Drive,
    50	the familiar "DOS Prompt" will appear.  This prompt will look something
    51	like this:
    52	                                                                                
    53	
    54	
    55	
    56	
    57	
    58	            A>
    59	
    60	This symbol signals 3 things:
    61	
    62	              1. DOS has been properly loaded into RAM
    63	              2. "A" is the DEFAULT drive
    64	              3. Awaits a DOS file management command
    65	
    66	Each disk drive and hard disk has a letter associated with it.  If a drive is
    67	considered the DEFAULT drive, then the computer will always assume that the
    68	information needed is in that drive, OR if something you have created is saved
    69	- it will be saved to that drive, UNLESS you tell the computer otherwise.
    70	
    71	All types of disks contain files.  We use DOS as a software tool to manage
    72	these files.  We not only tell the computer which file we want to erase or
    73	copy but also which drive it is currently in.
    74	
    75	
    76	DOS FILE CONVENTIONS
    77	--------------------
    78	FILES:  Any related set of instructions - programs, documents,
    79	spreadsheets, etc..  A floppy disk is like a file cabinet with each
    80	folder representing files on the disk (in the cabinet).
    81	
    82	Rules:   filename  | extension (optional)
    83	                   |
    84	    1-8 Characters | 1-3 Characters
    85	    No Spaces      | No Spaces
    86	    Letters/Numbers| Letters/Numbers
    87	
    88	If an optional extension is used, a period is used to separate the filename
    89	and extension.
    90	
    91	Many characters are allowed in filenaming.  The following are INVALID
    92	for filenames OR extensions:
    93	
    94	        .   "   /   \   [   ]   :   |   <   >   +   =   ;   ,
    95	
    96	Each file has a name.  When you want DOS to act on a file, you must
    97	specify its proper name (including its extension if applicable). A
    98	file's name is made up of a filename and an optional extension:
    99	
   100	     saledata.jly
   101	         ³   ³ ÀÄÄExtension (optional) - UP TO 3 CHARACTERS
   102	         ³   ÀÄPeriod required as Separator IF extension used
   103	         ÀÄÄFilename - UP TO 8 CHARACTERS
   104	
   105	Some filenames:   SAMPLE
   106	                  SAMPLE.DOC
   107	                  BUDGET.WK1
   108	
   109	Two files with the same exact name CANNOT exist on the same disk or
   110	subdirectory (subdirectories are covered under hard disk sections).
   111	                                                                                
   112	
   113	
   114	
   115	
   116	
   117	FILESIZE
   118	--------
   119	Computers use 1 BYTE to represent 1 character such as a letter of the
   120	alphabet, a number, a punctuation mark, a space, etc.  A BYTE is also a unit
   121	of measure since it represents 1 character.  We measure the size of RAM in
   122	Bytes, as well as the size of Files/Programs in Bytes.
   123	
   124	We also measure the capacity of Disks and RAM in Bytes.  So many Bytes
   125	can be contained on disks or RAM that we talk about:
   126	
   127	     KILObytes = 1,000     bytes   (often abbreviated "k")
   128	     MEGAbytes = 1,000,000 bytes   (often abbreviated "meg")
   129	
   130	5.25" disks Double Sided, Double Density = 360k
   131	            Double Sided, High Density   = 1.2meg
   132	
   133	3.5" disks  Double Sided, Double Density = 720k
   134	            Double Sided, High Density   = 1.4meg
   135	
   136	Hard Drives = 10meg, 20meg, 30meg, 40meb, 60meg,......350meg
   137	
   138	
   139	FREQUENTLY USED DOS COMMANDS
   140	----------------------------
   141	When DOS is booted, a copy of INTERNAL DOS commands are placed in the
   142	computer's memory (RAM).  These are called INTERNAL commands because
   143	they stay in RAM until the computer is turned off.  To use these
   144	commands you do not have to re-insert the DOS diskette.
   145	
   146	The rest of the commands on the DOS disk are called EXTERNAL commands
   147	because they are NOT read into RAM when you boot DOS.  Rather, to use them
   148	DOS must accessible in one of the disk drives.
   149	
   150	The following are some frequently used DOS commands:
   151	
   152	INTERNAL       ³   EXTERNAL (Insert DOS in Drive A)
   153	               ³
   154	DIR     TYPE   ³   FORMAT    CHKDSK
   155	COPY    CLS    ³   DISKCOPY
   156	ERASE   DATE   ³   COMP
   157	RENAME  TIME   ³   DISKCOMP
   158	
   159	**-- Internal DOS Commands -
   160	
   161	A>DIR B:  - To find out what files are on a diskette in the specified
   162	            drive (B in this example). If just DIR is typed and entered,
   163	            a listing of files in the default drive (A in this case) will be
   164	            displayed.
   165	
   166	A>DIR B:/P - Displays list of files one screen at a time
   167	
   168	A>DIR B:/W - Displays list of files using the entire width of the screen
   169	
   170	
   171	NOTE: The  /P  and  /W  options shown above for the DIR command are called
   172	      command switches.  Most DOS commands have a variety of switches to alter
   173	      the core command.
   174	                                                                                
   175	
   176	
   177	
   178	
   179	
   180	
   181	A>COPY A:filename.ext B: -  To copy one file from Disk A to Disk B
   182	                            instead of an entire diskette.
   183	
   184	A>DEL B:filename.ext - To remove the specified file(s) from the disk in
   185	                       the specified drive.
   186	
   187	A>DATE  - To change the system date.  This date will be "stamped" on each
   188	          file created or edited.
   189	
   190	A>TIME  - To change the system time.
   191	
   192	A>CLS  - To clear the screen
   193	
   194	
   195	**-- External DOS Commands -  DOS Disk required in Drive A or Hard Drive
   196	
   197	A>FORMAT B:  - Prepares a new disk in Drive B for use on the IBM PC.  If an
   198	               old disk is used, it will erase its contents.  (Follow on-
   199	               screen directions)
   200	
   201	A>FORMAT B:/S - Same as above, BUT ALSO Installs the INTERNAL DOS
   202	                commands on the new disk.  Thus, this disk is now
   203	                capable of starting the machine.
   204	
   205	A>CHKDSK B: - Indicates the number of files and amount of free storage
   206	              space remaining on the disk in drive B.  It also indicates the
   207	              amount of RAM storage.
   208	
   209	A>CHKDSK A: /F  - Fix any problems that CHKDSK finds (converts lost clusters
   210	                  to *.CHK files which can later be deleted)
   211	
   212	A>DISKCOPY A: B:  - Making an exact copy of the diskette in Drive A onto the
   213	                    diskette in Drive B.  (Follow on-screen directions)
   214	
   215	
   216	Remember, if the computer is not told differently, it will assume the DEFAULT
   217	drive:
   218	             A>COPY A:sample.wk1 B:
   219	
   220	is the same as:
   221	
   222	             A>COPY sample.wk1 B:
   223	
   224	The "A:" in the first example is redundant.
