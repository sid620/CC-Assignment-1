    11	   If you haven't examined a CD ROM player for your computer yet,
    12	 I suggest you do so. Offer to bring the refreshments of choice, and
    13	 have one of your friends give you a demonstration, or have a sales
    14	 person demonstrate a system that has a CD. You'll be impressed with
    15	 the abilities of these machines. The amount of information and data
    16	 that can be retrieved from a CD is amazing. The Multimedia CD's are
    17	 quite impressive, if done well. I received the Microsoft ENCARTA CD
    18	 as part of the promotional bundle with my system.
    19	
    20	   The video and voice clips are quite interesting and there is quite
    21	 a variety, from little bits of history shown to the sounds of dogs
    22	 barking. The quality of the sound depends on your system, but I was
    23	 driving my dog nuts, as she attempted to find the other dog in the
    24	 house. If you don't have a CD, I feel you are missing one of the
    25	 better resources available with a computer. Ensure the one you get
    26	 is the double speed or better and complies with the multimedia
    27	 standards. Then get on a good CD supplier's mailing list. A little
    28	 tip here: some of the bundles available are a little disappointing.

    35	
    36	 If you are reading the magazine, perhaps the following may be
    37	 of interest to you:
    38	
    39	
    40	                INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING
    41	
    42	Copyright 1995 EPubNet
    43	
    44	These days, word-processing and desktop publishing software gives
    45	writers and publishers enormous power in formatting documents for
    46	publication.  Unfortunately, this power is often thrown away before
    47	the reader gets to the document, by printing it onto paper. Paper
    48	lacks the flexibility and power of a computer processor.  Electronic
    49	Publishing lets publishers retain the capabilities of the computer
    50	for the use of the reader, by creating a document that is designed
    51	to be distributed and read entirely on computer.
    52	
    53	This is done in a number of ways.  A text may be created in universal
    54	ASCII format, which is readable by numerous text readers, word
    55	processors, and even with the DOS "type" command. Fidonews, the
    56	newsletter for the 29,000+ Fidonet BBS systems internationally, is a
    57	perfect example of this type of electronic publishing. A good text
    58	reader program allows the user to quickly scan the document for a
    59	certain word or phrase, page through it, and more.
    60	
    61	A more powerful form of electronic publishing uses Hypertext.
    62	Hypertext is a type of program which uses specially formatted
    63	documents - the reader uses a "Reader Program" to view the document,
    64	"jumping" between locations within a document using predefined
    65	"links". For instance, an electronic textbook on the government might
    66	contain a paragraph which refers to the US Congress. Rather than
    67	including a note (see page 456), as a paper textbook would, the
    68	electronic version would have the word "Congress" highlighted.
    69	Clicking on the word would instantly take the reader to the part
    70	of the book which explains Congress in more detail.
    71	
    72	Alternately, the "Congress" link could pop up a small note which
    73	gives a quick explanation of the topic, a diagram of the organization
    74	of the two Houses, or even a VGA graphic showing the Capitol building
    75	in full color. This method allows a writer to put basic and advanced
    76	information out of sight, to be called only by those readers who are
    77	interested in them. This allows a text to be informative and
    78	interesting to readers with varying levels of knowledge - beginners
    79	aren't confused by complex details, and experts aren't forced to wade
    80	through basic explanations.
    81	
    82	Electronic Periodicals are growing in popularity. By publishing
    83	electronically, the costs of typesetting, printing and shipping are
    84	eliminated. Publications can be distributed quickly and cheaply over
    85	phone lines, making them much more timely than print publications.
    86	EPubNet (see other bulletins) aids in this distribution greatly by
    87	offering a network of BBS's to pass publications along without
    88	charge. Currently there are many Electronic Periodicals in the form
    89	of magazines and newsletters. There are also many books available.
    90	
    91	Electronic Publishing has enormous potential for the future. Many
    92	companies are already using the tools for training and marketing
    93	purposes, as well as documentation and help systems for software.
    94	As the concepts become more familiar, and software and hardware
    95	becomes more common, the electronic format will become a major
    96	supplement to the print format. Consumers will find it much more
    97	convenient and inexpensive to have their favorite magazines
    98	uploaded directly to their home computer within hours of publication
    99	than waiting for the US Mail to bring it around to their mailbox.
   100	
   101	The opportunity exists now to get involved in the ground level of a
   102	breaking new industry. Take it!
   103	
   104	***********************************************************************
   105	
   106	FOR SYSOPS
   107	
   108	EPubNet maintains an open invitation to sysops interested in
   109	joining EPubNet, and tries to accommodate as many different
   110	operating platforms and networking formats as possible. The core
   111	of EPubNet is PC Compatible Fidonet systems, but the net is open
   112	to gating messages and files to other network types, with permission.
   113	
   114	REQUIREMENTS TO JOIN
   115	There is no official application process for EPubNet. Below are the
   116	requirements:
   117	
   118	(1) Establish a link from an eligible hub
   119	    This merely means contacting a current member of the net who is
   120	    able to feed other systems, and asking to take the message
   121	    and/or file areas from them. The HUBS.EPN file contains a list
   122	    of EPubNet nodes willing to provide feeds. The Filebone is an
   123	    alternative you may want to consider (see next section).
   124	
   125	(2) Minimum Polling
   126	    You must poll your feed at least once a week, more often if your
   127	    hub requires it (to prevent unsent mail from taking up too much
   128	    disk space).
   129	
   130	(3) System Information
   131	    At the end of this file the system information needed to list
   132	    your BBS in the membership directory is listed. Once you have
   133	    established a feed, please post this information in the EP-SYSOP
   134	    echo.
   135	
   136	(4) Required Message Areas
   137	    All systems which receive EPubNet message or file areas should
   138	    carry the EP-SYSOP message area, to keep in contact with the
   139	    network.
   140	
   141	
   142	FILE DISTRIBUTION
   143	
   144	If you want to participate in file distribution, you just need
   145	to ask your hub to set you up to receive them. Usually you can turn
   146	them on and off as you like with RAID compatible requests, which work
   147	like Areafix requests. A variety of programs are available to let you
   148	process these files. Popular programs include TICK and ALLFIX. The
   149	Fidonet FILE_ECHO backbone echo is a good place to find out about
   150	these programs.
   151	
   152	
   153	FILEBONE
   154	
   155	The Filebone is a system within Fidonet which distributes message
   156	and file areas for a large number of file distribution networks,
   157	such as ANSINet (ANSI art), PDN (Programmer's Distribution Network),
   158	and WinNet (For Windows programs).
   159	
   160	National Hubs for the Filebone are listed in the FILEBONE.NA file,
   161	along with the different file nets and file areas. You can get
   162	EPubNet file and message areas from any of these hubs, along with
   163	file and message areas from other file networks. If you are only
   164	interested in the EPubNet areas you'll probably be better off linking
   165	in through an EPubNet hub, since you'll get things quicker. But if
   166	you're interested in getting other areas in addition to EPubNet, the
   167	Filebone is a good bet.
   168	
   169	
   170	EPUBNET LEADERSHIP
