    10	First off, Welcome!
    11	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    12	Carrying on a war against misinformation and injustice is hardly
    13	something I can do by myself. If you wish to contribute to this
    14	magazine, telnet to MARS hotel (130.18.64.3 log in as bbs) and send
    15	mail to DigitalBishop. It's cumbersome but seeing as how I have no
    16	real internet address, it'll do.
    17	
    18	This magazine speaks out for the rights of those who have been
    19	injusticed by the likes of Tom Forester, the US Government, and Bell
    20	Security. Once again, speaking out for hackers' rights is risky and
    21	hence the alias. Such is another injustice. For did someone not say,
    22	long ago, that "all men were created equal"?
    23	
    24	If you are going to submit something to me, make the subject either
    25	Personal (to me personally), Letters to the Editor (which may be
    26	reprinted herein), or Submission (an article which may be used). This
    27	will provide some distinction.
    28	
    29	Part 1: Tom Forester, the computer nerd
    30	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    31	Mister Forester and his hippocritical words piss me off. This word's
    32	for you, Tom. I'm not going to resort to name calling or
    33	generalizations, look where they got Tom!
    34	
    35	Everyone who gains access to a computer system through unintended
    36	channels is NOT vandalizing it. Vandalizing would include leaving
    37	notes or modifying data, which is simply not done by those whom I
    38	would call "hackers".  Tom Forester states that hackers did damage to
    39	the E911 system, which routes and handles 911 calls. THESE HACKERS DID
    40	NO SUCH THING. They distributed a file describing how such calls are
    41	handled to the public. This document was later found to be public
    42	access information. In other words, Mister Forester has blown
    43	distribution of information out of proportion into maliciously
    44	damaging a system. Not quite the same, Tom.
    45	
    46	Tom, you will probably be greatly disillusioned by this, but I am not
    47	a social outcast. I have girlfriends and accquaintances just like
    48	other people. Normal people, if you will. I do not wear glasses, I do
    49	not wear plaid (God I hate plaid), and I don't have a pocket
    50	protector. Right now I am wearing a Metallica T-Shirt and some old
    51	jeans. Whoops, that makes me a heavy metal fan. Do I worship Satan
    52	too? I am not mad at society, nor do I take said anger out on systems
    53	by means of hacking. I have only had one pizza delivered to this house
    54	in all the years I have been alive, I rarely drink carbonated
    55	beverages, and eat even fewer snacks. Generalization contributes to
    56	racism, Mr. Forester. It is now also a cause of discrimination against
    57	hackers.  Where were we? Oh yes, my computer skills are mediocre. I've
    58	been using computers since I was 4, that gives me 10 years of
    59	experience, plus mastery of C, Pascal, 6502 and 65816 assembly
    60	language, not to mention higher level languages like BASIC, Logo, etc.
    61	and partial mastery of 80x86 AT Assembly language. One again, a
    62	generalization.
    63	
    64	Also, Mr. Forester, it is time to clamp down on hacking and throw all
    65	these nerds in jail. This was based on your words and generalizations,
    66	not mine. Why do I hack? To free information from Illuminati hands, to
    67	show system administrators their security holes. Ask Prarie States
    68	Marketing of Lenexa, KS if any harm was done to their system. No, I
    69	left a little note to them showing them all the security holes they
    70	had. When I came back, they had patched these holes. Maybe it's also a
    71	game of chess for me, outwitting the sysop. The idea of Pawn takes
    72	King always appealed to me. There are many definitions of 'hacking'.
    73	My personal definition, is any person who obtains access to a system
    74	through unauthorized channels and does not damage the system. It
    75	stands to reason, however, that hackers modify security logs to ensure
    76	their safety, lest Big Brother and his injustices come knocking at
    77	your door. When the public thinks of hacking, they will think of
    78	someone who 'breaks in' to a top secret computer and trashes
    79	everything. This guy would not be a hacker, but would be an outcast of
    80	any hacker community as would anyone else who damages a system, or
    81	creates viruses. This sort of thing is not tolerated anywhere in the
    82	world, Forester, not even by those uncouth, nerdly hackers. You also
    83	have the media to thank for that misleading definition of 'hacker'.
    84	
    85	God, I could go on forever, but I think I'll stop here, Forester.
    86	
    87	Tom Forester is not a psychologist, neither is he an ethicist, nor is
    88	he an anylist. Other than that, he's a good writer, I want you to
    89	know.
    90	
    91	** If you reading this have anything to say to Forester to be printed in the    next issue, or anything to say to me, please send it.
    92	
    93	Part 2: Definition of a hacker
    94	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    95	What is a hacker, to clarify the word? A hacker is someone who:
    96	
    97	-> NEVER damages any system
    98	-> USUALLY tells the system operator of security holes one he has
    99	   finished
   100	-> ALWAYS gains access thru unauthorized channels
   101	
   102	'Nuff said? Undoubtedly, I forgot a few. Mail them to me.
   103	
   104	Part 3: A parting thought (and a poor choice of words!)
   105	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   106	If I left anything unsaid, write an article.
   107	Hello to the Computer Underground Digest,
   108	   The EFF,
   109	   Knight Lightning,
   110	   and the MECH.
   111	Expect future issues to be lengthier than this one..
   112	
   113	You'll hear more from me soon.
