     2	         Installing 386MAX/BlueMAX on a Stacker System
     3	
     4	The information below explains how to install Stacker on a system that has
     5	386MAX or BlueMAX installed, and how to install 386MAX or BlueMAX on a system
     6	that currently has Stacker installed.  386MAX is used for all examples.

    10	ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
    11	ù Uninstall 386MAX:  go to the 386MAX directory and type STRIPMGR C: /ST
    12	  (where C:  represents your boot drive) and press < ENTER >.  This will
    13	  remove all references to 386MAX in the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.
    14	  If you have allowed 386MAX to install QCACHE on your system, place a REM
    15	  statement in front of the line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT that loads QCACHE.
    16	
    17	ù Reboot your system.
    18	
    19	ù Install STACKER per the directions.  After you have installed STACKER, run
    20	  ALL of your applications to ensure that they work correctly.  Do not
    21	  continue if STACKER installation does not complete as expected or if you
    22	  have problems using your applications.
    23	
    24	  If you are having problems at this point, consult your STACKER
    25	  documentation and/or Stac technical support to get your system in working
    26	  order.
    27	
    28	ù Reinstall 386MAX using the instructions below only after successful STACKER
    29	  installation and implementation.

    33	Installing 386MAX on a STACKER system 
    34	ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
    35	This information explains how to install 386MAX or BlueMAX if either Stacker
    36	1.0 or Stacker 2.0 is already present on the system.  These directions apply
    37	only to some STACKER users.  To determine if you need these instructions, use
    38	the SWAPMAP utility provided by STACKER.  Go to the STACKER directory, type
    39	SWAPMAP, and press <ENTER>.  The printout should look similar to the one
    40	below:
    41	
    42	SWAPMAP - 2.00, (c) 1990-91, Stac Electronics, Carlsbad, CA
    43	Drive A: was drive A: at boot time
    44	Drive B: was drive B: at boot time
    45	Drive C: was drive D: at boot time  [ D:\STACVOL.000 = 52.6MB (physical) ]
    46	Drive D: was drive C: at boot time
    47	
    48	It is important to note the line that begins with "Drive C:".  If drive C:
    49	was a drive other than C: at boot time, follow these directions.  Otherwise,
    50	follow the on-screen prompts to install 386MAX.  A user with the above
    51	printout has an UNCOMPRESSED D:  drive, and a COMPRESSED C:  drive.  If these
    52	terms are unclear, consult your STACKER documentation.  Continue only when
    53	you understand which of your drives are compressed and which are
    54	uncompressed.
    55	
    56	ù Create a back-up bootable floppy.  You can do so by typing FORMAT A: /S at
    57	  the DOS prompt and pressing < ENTER >.  Copy the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
    58	  from the UNCOMPRESSED drive.  Test the disk by booting off of it.  Make the
    59	  CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT on this disk as simple as possible, but be sure
    60	  to include the STACKER drivers.
    61	
    62	ù Check the CONFIG.SYS on the UNCOMPRESSED drive.  If you are using version
    63	  2.0 of STACKER, it is advisable to use the /SYNC parameter for SSWAP.  The
    64	  device line in CONFIG.SYS should look similar to this:
    65	
    66	      DEVICE = C:\STACKER\SSWAP.COM C: D: /SYNC
    67	            or
    68	      DEVICE = C:\STACKER\SSWAP.COM C:\STACVOL.DSK /SYNC
    69	
    70	  If you have a version of STACKER prior to 2.0, or do not wish to use the
    71	  /SYNC parameter, you must replace the AUTOEXEC.BAT file created by STACKER
    72	  on the COMPRESSED drive with the AUTOEXEC.BAT file from the uncompressed
    73	  "boot" drive.  In the SWAPMAP example above, drive D: was C: at boot time, 
    74	  therefore D: is the boot drive.
    75	
    76	  To replace AUTOEXEC.BAT go to the STACKER directory and type the following
    77	  commands, pressing <ENTER> after each one.
    78	
    79	  SATTRIB -R C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT
    80	  COPY d:\AUTOEXEC.BAT C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT
    81	        (where d: represents the uncompressed drive)
    82	
    83	ù Run 386MAX's Install program.  When Install asks for the letter of the boot
    84	  drive, enter the letter of the UNCOMPRESSED drive (D: in the given example).
    85	  Do not run Maximize.  After responding NO to Maximize, you will be returned
    86	  to a DOS prompt.
    87	
    88	ù Create a 386MAX directory on the UNCOMPRESSED drive.  Copy the following
    89	  files into the directory:
    90	
    91	           386MAX.SYS
    92	           386MAX.PRO
    93	           386MAX.VXD      <== Provides windows support
    94	           386LOAD.SYS
    95	           386LOAD.CFG
    96	           XLAT.COM
    97	
    98	ù Change the device line in CONFIG.SYS on the uncompressed drive from:
    99	
   100	      DEVICE = C:\386MAX\386MAX.SYS PRO=C:\386MAX\386MAX.PRO
   101	
   102	  to:
   103	
   104	      DEVICE = C:\386MAX\386MAX.SYS PRO=\386MAX\386MAX.PRO
   105	
   106	  Make sure that the DEVICE= statement that loads 386MAX comes before the
   107	  DEVICE= statements for STACKER.COM.  Otherwise, STACKER drivers will not be
   108	  considered candidates for loading into high DOS.
   109	
   110	ù Run Maximize from the 386MAX directory on the compressed drive (C: in the
   111	  example given).  When asked, tell Maximize that you boot from the
   112	  uncompressed drive (D:  in the example).
   113	
   114	If you have any problems installing 386MAX on your system, typing PREINST 
   115	<ENTER> at the command line in the 386MAX subdirectory will return your 
   116	CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT to the configuration prior to the installation of 
   117	386MAX.  If you have problems after starting Maximize, PREMAXIM will return 
   118	your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT to the configuration prior to the last pass 
   119	of Maximize.
   120	
   121	Please consult STACKER documentation and/or STACKER technical support for
   122	issues relating to STACKER.
