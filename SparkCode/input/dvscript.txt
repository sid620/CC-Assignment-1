     2	This File details the process for creating and using Scripts with DESQview
     3	
     4	   What is a startup script you ask? Well, the main benefit is that 
     5	it will automate the process of opening the windows that you usually 
     6	have to startup by hand. This is particularly useful for SysOp who 
     7	run there systems under DESQview.
     8	
     9	   Most DESQview scripts are activated by pressing a key 
    10	combination, a startup script however automatically starts when you 
    11	activate DESQview, Thus: If you run a BBS under DESQview, you can 
    12	tell your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to activate DESQview, then DESQview's 
    13	will automatically open the window you BBS runs in. This is 
    14	convenient in the event of power outages, or other unattended 
    15	"Boot-ups".
    16	
    17	   The procedure is actually not that complicated, the following 
    18	instructions will take you through the process creating and using 
    19	DESQview scripts step by step.
    20	
    21	
    22	1) Load DESQview by typing DV at the DOS prompt.
    23	
    24	2) Hold down a shift key and tap ALT.
    25	    "This activates the LEARN menu"
    26	
    27	3) Press the = sign. 
    28	    "= Stands for STARTUP script"
    29	
    30	4) Choose a key combination to invoke the script.
    31	    "Although it is a startup script desqview still wants a key 
    32	combination, if you have F11 - F12 keys, something like ALT-F11 
    33	would be appropriate as you are unlikely to ever accidentally hit it.
    34	
    35	5) Type an exclamation mark and any name such as !AUTO-OPEN
    36	
    37	6) Desqview is now back at the main menu and is recording every key 
    38	stroke you make from now on. Try not to make many mistakes as they 
    39	will be recorded as well. Now open all the windows that you want to 
    40	be invoked automatically when you startup DESQview. You can 
    41	rearrange or use any of the other DESQview features to adjust your 
    42	windows to the size and shape you desire. Once everything is the way 
    43	you want it to be at startup hold down shift and tap ALT again to 
    44	return to the Learn Menu. 
    45	
    46	7) Hit the hyphen key to finish the script.
    47	    " Your Script hasn't been saved to disk, you will lose it if you 
    48	exit DESQview without saving it"
    49	
    50	8) Hit SHIFT-ALT, then hit S to save it. Use the default filename 
    51	DESQVIEW.DVS.
    52	
    53	9) Now to sample your work, exit DESQview then reinvoke it and sit 
    54	back and watch what happens, your programs should all startup fine.
    55	
    56	Good Job! I hope this is helpful, I wondered how to do this for 
    57	quite awhile, It is the most useful feature I think. 
