     1	The Meaning of `Hack' - The Jargon File
     2	=====================
     3	
     4	"The word {hack} doesn't really have 69 different meanings", according
     5	to Phil Agre, an MIT hacker.  "In fact, {hack} has only one meaning, an
     6	extremely subtle and profound one which defies articulation.  Which
     7	connotation is implied by a given use of the word depends in similarly
     8	profound ways on the context.  Similar remarks apply to a couple of
     9	other hacker words, most notably {random}."
    10	
    11	Hacking might be characterized as "an appropriate application of
    12	ingenuity".  Whether the result is a quick-and-dirty patchwork job or
    13	a carefully crafted work of art, you have to admire the cleverness
    14	that went into it.
    15	
    16	An important secondary meaning of {hack} is `a creative practical
    17	joke'.  This kind of hack is often easier to explain to non-hackers
    18	than the programming kind.  Accordingly, here are some examples of
    19	practical joke hacks:
    20	
    21	In 1961, students from Caltech (California Institute of Technology in
    22	Pasadena) hacked the Rose Bowl football game.  One student posed as a
    23	reporter and `interviewed' the director of the University of
    24	Washington card stunts (such stunts involve people in the stands who
    25	hold up colored cards to make pictures).  The reporter learned exactly
    26	how the stunts were operated, and also that the director would be out
    27	to dinner later.
    28	
    29	While the director was eating, the students (who called themselves the
    30	`Fiendish Fourteen') picked a lock and stole one of the direction
    31	sheets for the card stunts.  They then had a printer run off 2300
    32	copies of the sheet.  The next day they picked the lock again and
    33	stole the master plans for the stunts, large sheets of graph paper
    34	colored in with the stunt pictures.  Using these as a guide, they
    35	carefully made `corrections' for three of the stunts on the
    36	duplicate instruction sheets.  Finally, they broke in once more,
    37	replacing the stolen master plans and substituting the stack of
    38	altered instruction sheets for the original set.
    39	
    40	The result was that three of the pictures were totally different.
    41	Instead of spelling "WASHINGTON", the word "CALTECH" was flashed.
    42	Another stunt showed the word "HUSKIES", the Washington nickname,
    43	but spelled it backwards.  And what was supposed to have been a
    44	picture of a husky instead showed a beaver.  (Both Caltech and MIT use
    45	the beaver as a mascot.  Beavers are nature's engineers.)
    46	
    47	After the game, the Washington faculty athletic representative said,
    48	"Some thought it ingenious; others were indignant."  The Washington
    49	student body president remarked, "No hard feelings, but at the time
    50	it was unbelievable.  We were amazed."
    51	
    52	This is now considered a classic hack, particularly because revising
    53	the direction sheets constituted a form of programming not unlike
    54	computer programming.
    55	
    56	Another classic hack:
    57	
    58	Some MIT students once illicitly used a quantity of thermite to weld a
    59	trolley car to its tracks.  The hack was actually not dangerous, as
    60	they did this at night to a parked trolley.  It took the transit
    61	people quite a while to figure out what was wrong with the trolley,
    62	and even longer to figure out how to fix it.  They ended up putting
    63	jacks under the trolley and cutting the section of track on either
    64	side of the wheel with oxyacetylene torches.  Then they unbolted the
    65	wheel, welded in a new piece of track, bolted on a new wheel, and
    66	removed the jacks.  The hackers sneaked in the next night and stole the
    67	piece of track and wheel!
    68	
    69	The piece of trolley track with the wheel still welded to it was later
    70	used as the trophy at the First Annual All-Tech Sing.  They carted it
    71	in on a very heavy duty dolly up the freight elevator of the Student
    72	Center.  Six feet of rail and a trolley wheel is a *lot* of
    73	steel.
    74	
    75	A rather similar hack, perpetrated by a fraternity at CMU, cost their
    76	campus its trolley service.
    77	
    78	Though these displayed some cleverness, the side-effect of expensive
    79	property damage was definitely an esthetic minus.  The best hacks are
    80	harmless ones.
    81	
    82	And another:
    83	
    84	One winter, late at night, an MIT fraternity hosed down an underpass
    85	that is part of a commuter expressway near MIT.  This produced an ice
    86	slick that `trapped' a couple of small cars: they didn't have the
    87	momentum or traction to climb out of the underpass.  While it was
    88	clever to apply some simple science to trap a car, it was also very
    89	dangerous as it could have caused a collision.  Therefore this was a
    90	very poor hack overall.
    91	
    92	And yet another:
    93	
    94	On November 20, 1982, MIT hacked the Harvard-Yale football game.  Just
    95	after Harvard's second touchdown against Yale in the second quarter, a
    96	small black ball popped up out of the ground at the 40-yard line, and
    97	grew bigger, and bigger, and bigger.  The letters "MIT" appeared all
    98	over the ball.  As the players and officials stood around gawking, the
    99	ball grew to six feet in diameter and then burst with a bang and a
   100	cloud of white smoke.
   101	
   102	As the Boston Globe later reported, "If you want to know the truth,
   103	M.I.T. won The Game."
   104	
   105	The prank had taken weeks of careful planning by members of MIT's
   106	Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.  The device consisted of a weather
   107	balloon, a hydraulic ram powered by Freon gas to lift it out of the
   108	ground, and a vacuum-cleaner motor to inflate it.  They made eight
   109	separate expeditions to Harvard Stadium between 1 and 5 AM, in which
   110	they located an unused 110-volt circuit in the stadium, and ran buried
   111	wiring from the stadium circuit to the 40-yard line, where they buried
   112	the balloon device.  When the time came to activate the device, two
   113	fraternity members had merely to flip a circuit breaker and push a
   114	plug into an outlet.
   115	
   116	This stunt had all the earmarks of a perfect hack: surprise,
   117	publicity, the ingenious use of technology, safety, and harmlessness.
   118	The use of manual control allowed the prank to be timed so as not to
   119	disrupt the game (it was set off between plays, so the outcome of the
   120	game would not be unduly affected).  The perpetrators had even
   121	thoughtfully attached a note to the balloon explaining that the device
   122	was not dangerous and contained no explosives.
   123	
   124	Harvard president Derek Bok commented: "They have an awful lot of
   125	clever people down there at MIT, and they did it again."  President
   126	Paul E. Gray of MIT said, "There is absolutely no truth to the rumor
   127	that I had anything to do with it, but I wish there were."
   128	
   129	Finally, here is a great story about one of the classic computer hacks.
   130	
   131	Back in the mid-1970s, several of the system support staff at Motorola
   132	discovered a relatively simple way to crack system security on the
   133	Xerox CP-V timesharing system.  Through a simple programming strategy,
   134	it was possible for a user program to trick the system into running a
   135	portion of the program in `master mode' (supervisor state), in which
   136	memory protection does not apply.  The program could then poke a large
   137	value into its `privilege level' byte (normally write-protected) and
   138	could then proceed to bypass all levels of security within the
   139	file-management system, patch the system monitor, and do numerous
   140	other interesting things.  In short, the barn door was wide open.
   141	
   142	Motorola quite properly reported this problem to XEROX via an official
   143	`level 1 SIDR' (a bug report with a perceived urgency of `needs to be
   144	fixed yesterday').  Because the text of each SIDR was entered into a
   145	database that could be viewed by quite a number of people, Motorola
   146	followed the approved procedure: they simply reported the problem as
   147	`Security SIDR', and attached all of the necessary documentation,
   148	ways-to-reproduce, etc. separately.
   149	
   150	Xerox sat on their thumbs...they either didn't realize the severity of
   151	the problem, or didn't assign the necessary operating-system-staff
   152	resources to develop and distribute an official patch.
   153	
   154	Months passed.  The Motorola guys pestered their Xerox field-support
   155	rep, to no avail.  Finally they decided to take Direct Action, to
   156	demonstrate to Xerox management just how easily the system could be
   157	cracked and just how thoroughly the system security systems could be
   158	subverted.
   159	
   160	They dug around in the operating-system listings and devised a
   161	thoroughly devilish set of patches.  These patches were then
   162	incorporated into a pair of programs called Robin Hood and Friar Tuck.
   163	Robin Hood and Friar Tuck were designed to run as `ghost jobs'
   164	(daemons, in UNIX terminology); they would use the existing loophole
   165	to subvert system security, install the necessary patches, and then
   166	keep an eye on one another's statuses in order to keep the system
   167	operator (in effect, the superuser) from aborting them.
   168	
   169	So... one day, the system operator on the main CP-V software
   170	development system in El Segundo was surprised by a number of unusual
   171	phenomena.  These included the following:
   172	
   173	   * Tape drives would rewind and dismount their tapes in the middle of a
   174	     job.
   175	   * Disk drives would seek back and forth so rapidly that they'd attempt
   176	     to walk across the floor (see {walking drives}).
   177	   * The card-punch output device would occasionally start up of itself
   178	     and punch a {lace card} (every hole punched).  These would usually
   179	     jam in the punch.
   180	   * The console would print snide and insulting messages from Robin Hood
   181	     to Friar Tuck, or vice versa.
   182	   * The Xerox card reader had two output stackers;  it could be
   183	     instructed to stack into A, stack into B, or stack into A unless a
   184	     card was unreadable, in which case the bad card was placed into
   185	     stacker B.  One of the patches installed by the ghosts added some
   186	     code to the card-reader driver... after reading a card, it would flip
   187	     over to the opposite stacker.  As a result, card decks would divide
   188	     themselves in half when they were read, leaving the operator to
   189	     recollate them manually.
   190	
   191	There were some other effects produced, as well.
   192	
   193	Naturally, the operator called in the operating-system developers.  They
   194	found the bandit ghost jobs running, and X'ed them... and were once
   195	again surprised.  When Robin Hood was X'ed, the following sequence of
   196	events took place:
   197	
   198	     !X id1
   199	
   200	     id1: Friar Tuck... I am under attack!  Pray save me!
   201	     id1: Off (aborted)
   202	
   203	     id2: Fear not, friend Robin!  I shall rout the Sheriff of 
   204	          Nottingham's men!
   205	
   206	     id1: Thank you, my good fellow!
   207	
   208	Each ghost-job would detect the fact that the other had been killed,
   209	and would start a new copy of the recently-slain program within a few
   210	milliseconds.  The only way to kill both ghosts was to kill them
   211	simultaneously (very difficult) or to deliberately crash the system.
   212	
   213	Finally, the system programmers did the latter... only to find that
   214	the bandits appeared once again when the system rebooted!  It turned
   215	out that these two programs had patched the boot-time image (the
   216	/vmunix file, in UNIX terms) and had added themselves to the list of
   217	programs that were to be started at boot time...
   218	
   219	The Robin Hood and Friar Tuck ghosts were finally eradicated when the
   220	system staff rebooted the system from a clean boot-tape and
   221	reinstalled the monitor.  Not long thereafter, Xerox released a patch
   222	for this problem.
   223	
   224	It is alleged that Xerox filed a complaint with Motorola's management about
   225	the merry-prankster actions of the two employees in question.  It is
   226	not recorded that any serious disciplinary action was taken against
   227	either of them.
