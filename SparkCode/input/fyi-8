    12	
    13	   This handbook is the product of the Site Security Policy Handbook
    14	   Working Group (SSPHWG), a combined effort of the Security Area and
    15	   User Services Area of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
    16	   This FYI RFC provides information for the Internet community.  It
    17	   does not specify an Internet standard.  Distribution of this memo is

    31	Editors' Note
    32	
    33	   This FYI RFC is a first attempt at providing Internet users guidance
    34	   on how to deal with security issues in the Internet.  As such, this
    35	   document is necessarily incomplete.  There are some clear shortfalls;
    36	   for example, this document focuses mostly on resources available in
    37	   the United States.  In the spirit of the Internet's "Request for
    38	   Comments" series of notes, we encourage feedback from users of this
    39	   handbook.  In particular, those who utilize this document to craft
    40	   their own policies and procedures.
    41	
    42	   This handbook is meant to be a starting place for further research
    43	   and should be viewed as a useful resource, but not the final
    44	   authority.  Different organizations and jurisdictions will have
    45	   different resources and rules.  Talk to your local organizations,
    46	   consult an informed lawyer, or consult with local and national law
    47	   enforcement.  These groups can help fill in the gaps that this
    48	   document cannot hope to cover.

   127	1.  Introduction
   128	
   129	1.1  Purpose of this Work
   130	
   131	   This handbook is a guide to setting computer security policies and
   132	   procedures for sites that have systems on the Internet.  This guide
   133	   lists issues and factors that a site must consider when setting their
   134	   own policies.  It makes some recommendations and gives discussions of
   135	   relevant areas.
   136	
   137	   This guide is only a framework for setting security policies and
   138	   procedures.  In order to have an effective set of policies and
   139	   procedures, a site will have to make many decisions, gain agreement,
   140	   and then communicate and implement the policies.
   141	
   142	1.2  Audience
   143	
   144	   The audience for this work are system administrators and decision
   145	   makers (who are more traditionally called "administrators" or "middle
   146	   management") at sites.  This document is not directed at programmers
   147	   or those trying to create secure programs or systems.  The focus of
   148	   this document is on the policies and procedures that need to be in
   149	   place to support any technical security features that a site may be
   150	   implementing.
   151	
   152	   The primary audience for this work are sites that are members of the
   153	   Internet community.  However, this document should be useful to any
   154	   site that allows communication with other sites.  As a general guide
   155	   to security policies, this document may also be useful to sites with
   156	   isolated systems.

   169	1.3  Definitions
   170	
   171	   For the purposes of this guide, a "site" is any organization that
   172	   owns computers or network-related resources.  These resources may
   173	   include host computers that users use, routers, terminal servers,
   174	   PC's or other devices that have access to the Internet.  A site may
   175	   be a end user of Internet services or a service provider such as a
   176	   regional network.  However, most of the focus of this guide is on
   177	   those end users of Internet services.
   178	
   179	   We assume that the site has the ability to set policies and
   180	   procedures for itself with the concurrence and support from those who
   181	   actually own the resources.
   182	
   183	   The "Internet" is those set of networks and machines that use the
   184	   TCP/IP protocol suite, connected through gateways, and sharing a
   185	   common name and address spaces [1].
   186	
   187	   The term "system administrator" is used to cover all those who are
   188	   responsible for the day-to-day operation of resources.  This may be a
   189	   number of individuals or an organization.
   190	
   191	   The term "decision maker" refers to those people at a site who set or
   192	   approve policy.  These are often (but not always) the people who own
   193	   the resources.
   194	
   195	1.4  Related Work
   196	
   197	   The IETF Security Policy Working Group (SPWG) is working on a set of
   198	   recommended security policy guidelines for the Internet [23].  These
   199	   guidelines may be adopted as policy by regional networks or owners of
   200	   other resources.  This handbook should be a useful tool to help sites
   201	   implement those policies as desired or required.  However, even
   202	   implementing the proposed policies isn't enough to secure a site.
   203	   The proposed Internet policies deal only with network access
   204	   security.  It says nothing about how sites should deal with local
   205	   security issues.
   206	
   207	1.5  Scope
   208	
   209	   This document covers issues about what a computer security policy
   210	   should contain, what kinds of procedures are need to enforce
   211	   security, and some recommendations about how to deal with the
   212	   problem.  When developing a security policy, close attention should
   213	   be made not only on the security needs and requirements of the local
   214	   network, but also the security needs and requirements of the other
   215	   interconnected networks.

   223	
   224	
   225	   This is not a cookbook for computer security.  Each site has
   226	   different needs; the security needs of a corporation might well be
   227	   different than the security needs of an academic institution.  Any
   228	   security plan has to conform to the needs and culture of the site.
   229	
   230	   This handbook does not cover details of how to do risk assessment,
   231	   contingency planning, or physical security.  These things are
   232	   essential in setting and implementing effective security policy, but
   233	   this document leaves treatment of those issues to other documents.
   234	   We will try to provide some pointers in that direction.
   235	
   236	   This document also doesn't talk about how to design or implement
   237	   secure systems or programs.
   238	
   239	1.6  Why Do We Need Security Policies and Procedures?
   240	
   241	   For most sites, the interest in computer security is proportional to
   242	   the perception of risk and threats.
   243	
   244	   The world of computers has changed dramatically over the past
   245	   twenty-five years.  Twenty-five years ago, most computers were
   246	   centralized and managed by data centers.  Computers were kept in
   247	   locked rooms and staffs of people made sure they were carefully
   248	   managed and physically secured.  Links outside a site were unusual.
   249	   Computer security threats were rare, and were basically concerned
   250	   with insiders: authorized users misusing accounts, theft and
   251	   vandalism, and so forth.  These threats were well understood and
   252	   dealt with using standard techniques: computers behind locked doors,
   253	   and accounting for all resources.
   254	
   255	   Computing in the 1990's is radically different.  Many systems are in
   256	   private offices and labs, often managed by individuals or persons
   257	   employed outside a computer center.  Many systems are connected into
   258	   the Internet, and from there around the world: the United States,
   259	   Europe, Asia, and Australia are all connected together.
   260	
   261	   Security threats are different today.  The time honored advice says
   262	   "don't write your password down and put it in your desk" lest someone
   263	   find it.  With world-wide Internet connections, someone could get
   264	   into your system from the other side of the world and steal your
   265	   password in the middle of the night when your building is locked up.
   266	   Viruses and worms can be passed from machine to machine.  The
   267	   Internet allows the electronic equivalent of the thief who looks for
   268	   open windows and doors; now a person can check hundreds of machines
   269	   for vulnerabilities in a few hours.
   270	
   271	   System administrators and decision makers have to understand the
   272	   security threats that exist, what the risk and cost of a problem
   273

   279	
   280	
   281	   would be, and what kind of action they want to take (if any) to
   282	   prevent and respond to security threats.
   283	
   284	   As an illustration of some of the issues that need to be dealt with
   285	   in security problems, consider the following scenarios (thanks to
   286	   Russell Brand [2, BRAND] for these):
   287	
   288	      - A system programmer gets a call reporting that a
   289	        major underground cracker newsletter is being
   290	        distributed from the administrative machine at his
   291	        center to five thousand sites in the US and
   292	        Western Europe.
   293	
   294	        Eight weeks later, the authorities call to inform
   295	        you the information in one of these newsletters
   296	        was used to disable "911" in a major city for
   297	        five hours.
   298	
   299	      - A user calls in to report that he can't login to his
   300	        account at 3 o'clock in the morning on a Saturday.  The
   301	        system staffer can't login either.  After rebooting to
   302	        single user mode, he finds that password file is empty.
   303	        By Monday morning, your staff determines that a number
   304	        of privileged file transfers took place between this
   305	        machine and a local university.
   306	
   307	        Tuesday morning a copy of the deleted password file is
   308	        found on the university machine along with password
   309	        files for a dozen other machines.
   310	
   311	        A week later you find that your system initialization
   312	        files had been altered in a hostile fashion.
   313	
   314	      - You receive a call saying that a breakin to a government
   315	        lab occurred from one of your center's machines.  You
   316	        are requested to provide accounting files to help
   317	        trackdown the attacker.
   318	
   319	        A week later you are given a list of machines at your
   320	        site that have been broken into.
   321	
   322	       - A reporter calls up asking about the breakin at your
   323	         center.  You haven't heard of any such breakin.
   324	
   325	        Three days later, you learn that there was a breakin.
   326	        The center director had his wife's name as a password.
   327

   336	
   337	      - A change in system binaries is detected.
   338	
   339	        The day that it is corrected, they again are changed.
   340	        This repeats itself for some weeks.
   341	
   342	      - If an intruder is found on your system, should you
   343	        leave the system open to monitor the situation or should
   344	        you close down the holes and open them up again later?
   345	
   346	      - If an intruder is using your site, should you call law
   347	        enforcement?  Who makes that decision?  If law enforcement asks
   348	        you to leave your site open, who makes that decision?
   349	
   350	      - What steps should be taken if another site calls you and says
   351	        they see activity coming from an account on your system?  What
   352	        if the account is owned by a local manager?
   353	
   354	1.7  Basic Approach
   355	
   356	   Setting security policies and procedures really means developing a
   357	   plan for how to deal with computer security.  One way to approach
   358	   this task is suggested by Fites, et. al. [3, FITES]:
   359	
   360	      -  Look at what you are trying to protect.
   361	      -  Look at what you need to protect it from.
   362	      -  Determine how likely the threats are.
   363	      -  Implement measures which will protect your assets in a
   364	         cost-effective manner.
   365	      -  Review the process continuously, and improve things every time
   366	         a weakness is found.
   367	
   368	   This handbook will concentrate mostly on the last two steps, but the
   369	   first three are critically important to making effective decisions
   370	   about security.  One old truism in security is that the cost of
   371	   protecting yourself against a threat should be less than the cost
   372	   recovering if the threat were to strike you.  Without reasonable
   373	   knowledge of what you are protecting and what the likely threats are,
   374	   following this rule could be difficult.
   375	
   376	1.8  Organization of this Document
   377	
   378	   This document is organized into seven parts in addition to this
   379	   introduction.
   380	
   381	   The basic form of each section is to discuss issues that a site might
   382	   want to consider in creating a computer security policy and setting
   383	   procedures to implement that policy.  In some cases, possible options
   384	   are discussed along with the some of the ramifications of those

   392	
   393	   choices.  As far as possible, this document tries not to dictate the
   394	   choices a site should make, since these depend on local
   395	   circumstances.  Some of the issues brought up may not apply to all
   396	   sites.  Nonetheless, all sites should at least consider the issues
   397	   brought up here to ensure that they do not miss some important area.
   398	
   399	   The overall flow of the document is to discuss policy issues followed
   400	   by the issues that come up in creating procedures to implement the
   401	   policies.
   402	
   403	   Section 2 discusses setting official site policies for access to
   404	   computing resources.  It also goes into the issue of what happens
   405	   when the policy is violated.  The policies will drive the procedures
   406	   that need to be created, so decision makers will need to make choices
   407	   about policies before many of the procedural issues in following
   408	   sections can be dealt with.  A key part of creating policies is doing
   409	   some kind of risk assessment to decide what really needs to be
   410	   protected and the level of resources that should be applied to
   411	   protect them.
   412	
   413	   Once policies are in place, procedures to prevent future security
   414	   problems should be established.  Section 3 defines and suggests
   415	   actions to take when unauthorized activity is suspected.  Resources
   416	   to prevent secruity breaches are also discussed.
   417	
   418	   Section 4 discusses types of procedures to prevent security problems.
   419	   Prevention is a key to security; as an example, the Computer
   420	   Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (CERT/CC) at Carnegie-
   421	   Mellon University (CMU) estimates that 80% or more of the problems
   422	   they see have to do with poorly chosen passwords.
   423	
   424	   Section 5 discusses incident handling: what kinds of issues does a
   425	   site face when someone violates the security policy.  Many decisions
   426	   will have to made on the spot as the incident occurs, but many of the
   427	   options and issues can be discussed in advance.  At very least,
   428	   responsibilities and methods of communication can be established
   429	   before an incident.  Again, the choices here are influenced by the
   430	   policies discussed in section 2.
   431	
   432	   Section 6 deals with what happens after a security violation has been
   433	   dealt with.  Security planning is an on-going cycle; just after an
   434	   incident has occurred is an excellent opportunity to improve policies
   435	   and procedures.
   436	
   437	   The rest of the document provides references and an annotated
   438	   bibliography.

   449	2.  Establishing Official Site Policy on Computer Security
   450	
   451	2.1  Brief Overview
   452	
   453	   2.1.1  Organization Issues
   454	
   455	      The goal in developing an official site policy on computer
   456	      security is to define the organization's expectations of proper
   457	      computer and network use and to define procedures to prevent and
   458	      respond to security incidents.  In order to do this, aspects of
   459	      the particular organization must be considered.
   460	
   461	      First, the goals and direction of the organization should be
   462	      considered.  For example, a military base may have very different
   463	      security concerns from a those of a university.
   464	
   465	      Second, the site security policy developed must conform to
   466	      existing policies, rules, regulations and laws that the
   467	      organization is subject to.  Therefore it will be necessary to
   468	      identify these and take them into consideration while developing
   469	      the policy.
   470	
   471	      Third, unless the local network is completely isolated and
   472	      standalone, it is necessary to consider security implications in a
   473	      more global context.  The policy should address the issues when
   474	      local security problems develop as a result of a remote site as
   475	      well as when problems occur on remote systems as a result of a
   476	      local host or user.
   477	
   478	   2.1.2  Who Makes the Policy?
   479	
   480	      Policy creation must be a joint effort by technical personnel, who
   481	      understand the full ramifications of the proposed policy and the
   482	      implementation of the policy, and by decision makers who have the
   483	      power to enforce the policy.  A policy which is neither
   484	      implementable nor enforceable is useless.
   485	
   486	      Since a computer security policy can affect everyone in an
   487	      organization, it is worth taking some care to make sure you have
   488	      the right level of authority in on the policy decisions.  Though a
   489	      particular group (such as a campus information services group) may
   490	      have responsibility for enforcing a policy, an even higher group
   491	      may have to support and approve the policy.
   492	
   493	   2.1.3  Who is Involved?
   494	
   495	      Establishing a site policy has the potential for involving every
   496	      computer user at the site in a variety of ways.  Computer users
   497

   503	
   504	
   505	      may be responsible for personal password administration.  Systems
   506	      managers are obligated to fix security holes and to oversee the
   507	      system.
   508	
   509	      It is critical to get the right set of people involved at the
   510	      start of the process.  There may already be groups concerned with
   511	      security who would consider a computer security policy to be their
   512	      area.  Some of the types of groups that might be involved include
   513	      auditing/control, organizations that deal with physical security,
   514	      campus information systems groups, and so forth.  Asking these
   515	      types of groups to "buy in" from the start can help facilitate the
   516	      acceptance of the policy.
   517	
   518	   2.1.4  Responsibilities
   519	
   520	      A key element of a computer security policy is making sure
   521	      everyone knows their own responsibility for maintaining security.
   522	      A computer security policy cannot anticipate all possibilities;
   523	      however, it can ensure that each kind of problem does have someone
   524	      assigned to deal with it.
   525	
   526	      There may be levels of responsibility associated with a policy on
   527	      computer security.  At one level, each user of a computing
   528	      resource may have a responsibility to protect his account.  A user
   529	      who allows his account to be compromised increases the chances of
   530	      compromising other accounts or resources.
   531	
   532	      System managers may form another responsibility level: they must
   533	      help to ensure the security of the computer system.  Network
   534	      managers may reside at yet another level.
   535	
   536	2.2  Risk Assessment
   537	
   538	   2.2.1  General Discussion
   539	
   540	      One of the most important reasons for creating a computer security
   541	      policy is to ensure that efforts spent on security yield cost
   542	      effective benefits.  Although this may seem obvious, it is
   543	      possible to be mislead about where the effort is needed.  As an
   544	      example, there is a great deal of publicity about intruders on
   545	      computers systems; yet most surveys of computer security show that
   546	      for most organizations, the actual loss from "insiders" is much
   547	      greater.
   548	
   549	      Risk analysis involves determining what you need to protect, what
   550	      you need to protect it from, and how to protect it.  Is is the
   551	      process of examining all of your risks, and ranking those risks by
   552	      level of severity.  This process involves making cost-effective
   553	
   554	
   555	
   556	Site Security Policy Handbook Working Group                    [Page 10]
   557	
   558	RFC 1244                 Site Security Handbook                July 1991
   559	
   560	
   561	      decisions on what you want to protect.  The old security adage
   562	      says that you should not spend more to protect something than it
   563	      is actually worth.
   564	
   565	      A full treatment of risk analysis is outside the scope of this
   566	      document.  [3, FITES] and [16, PFLEEGER] provide introductions to
   567	      this topic.  However, there are two elements of a risk analysis
   568	      that will be briefly covered in the next two sections:
   569	
   570	         1. Identifying the assets
   571	         2. Identifying the threats
   572	
   573	      For each asset, the basic goals of security are availability,
   574	      confidentiality, and integrity.  Each threat should be examined
   575	      with an eye to how the threat could affect these areas.
   576	
   577	   2.2.2  Identifying the Assets
   578	
   579	      One step in a risk analysis is to identify all the things that
   580	      need to be protected.  Some things are obvious, like all the
   581	      various pieces of hardware, but some are overlooked, such as the
   582	      people who actually use the systems. The essential point is to
   583	      list all things that could be affected by a security problem.
   584	
   585	      One list of categories is suggested by Pfleeger [16, PFLEEGER,
   586	      page 459]; this list is adapted from that source:
   587	
   588	         1. Hardware: cpus, boards, keyboards, terminals,
   589	            workstations, personal computers, printers, disk
   590	            drives, communication lines, terminal servers, routers.
   591	
   592	         2. Software: source programs, object programs,
   593	            utilities, diagnostic programs, operating systems,
   594	            communication programs.
   595	
   596	         3. Data: during execution, stored on-line, archived off-line,
   597	            backups, audit logs, databases, in transit over
   598	            communication media.
   599	
   600	         4. People: users, people needed to run systems.
   601	
   602	         5. Documentation: on programs, hardware, systems, local
   603	            administrative procedures.
   604	
   605	         6. Supplies: paper, forms, ribbons, magnetic media.

   615	
   616	
   617	   2.2.3  Identifying the Threats
   618	
   619	      Once the assets requiring protection are identified, it is
   620	      necessary to identify threats to those assests.  The threats can
   621	      then be examined to determine what potential for loss exists.  It
   622	      helps to consider from what threats you are trying to protect your
   623	      assets.
   624	
   625	      The following sections describe a few of the possible threats.
   626	
   627	      2.2.3.1  Unauthorized Access
   628	
   629	         A common threat that concerns many sites is unauthorized access
   630	         to computing facilities.  Unauthorized access takes many forms.
   631	         One means of unauthorized access is the use of another user's
   632	         account to gain access to a system.  The use of any computer
   633	         resource without prior permission may be considered
   634	         unauthorized access to computing facilities.
   635	
   636	         The seriousness of an unauthorized access will vary from site
   637	         to site.  For some sites, the mere act of granting access to an
   638	         unauthorized user may cause irreparable harm by negative media
   639	         coverage.  For other sites, an unauthorized access opens the
   640	         door to other security threats.  In addition, some sites may be
   641	         more frequent targets than others; hence the risk from
   642	         unauthorized access will vary from site to site.  The Computer
   643	         Emergency Response Team (CERT - see section 3.9.7.3.1) has
   644	         observed that well-known universities, government sites, and
   645	         military sites seem to attract more intruders.
   646	
   647	      2.2.3.2  Disclosure of Information
   648	
   649	         Another common threat is disclosure of information.  Determine
   650	         the value or sensitivity of the information stored on your
   651	         computers.  Disclosure of a password file might allow for
   652	         future unauthorized accesses.  A glimpse of a proposal may give
   653	         a competitor an unfair advantage.  A technical paper may
   654	         contain years of valuable research.
   655	
   656	      2.2.3.3  Denial of Service
   657	
   658	         Computers and networks provide valuable services to their
   659	         users.  Many people rely on these services in order to perform
   660	         their jobs efficiently.  When these services are not available
   661	         when called upon, a loss in productivity results.
   662	
   663	         Denial of service comes in many forms and might affect users in
   664	         a number of ways.  A network may be rendered unusable by a
   665	
   666	
   667	
   668	Site Security Policy Handbook Working Group                    [Page 12]

   671	
   672	
   673	         rogue packet, jamming, or by a disabled network component.  A
   674	         virus might slow down or cripple a computer system.  Each site
   675	         should determine which services are essential, and for each of
   676	         these services determine the affect to the site if that service
   677	         were to become disabled.
   678	
   679	2.3  Policy Issues
   680	
   681	   There are a number of issues that must be addressed when developing a
   682	   security policy.  These are:
   683	
   684	      1.  Who is allowed to use the resources?
   685	      2.  What is the proper use of the resources?
   686	      3.  Who is authorized to grant access and approve usage?
   687	      4.  Who may have system administration privileges?
   688	      5.  What are the user's rights and responsibilities?
   689	      6.  What are the rights and responsibilities of the
   690	          system administrator vs. those of the user?
   691	      7.  What do you do with sensitive information?
   692	
   693	   These issues will be discussed below.  In addition you may wish to
   694	   include a section in your policy concerning ethical use of computing
   695	   resources.  Parker, Swope and Baker [17, PARKER90] and Forester and
   696	   Morrison [18, FORESTER] are two useful references that address
   697	   ethical issues.
   698	
   699	   2.3.1  Who is Allowed to use the Resources?
   700	
   701	      One step you must take in developing your security policy is
   702	      defining who is allowed to use your system and services.  The
   703	      policy should explicitly state who is authorized to use what
   704	      resources.
   705	
   706	   2.3.2  What is the Proper Use of the Resources?
   707	
   708	      After determining who is allowed access to system resources it is
   709	      necessary to provide guidelines for the acceptable use of the
   710	      resources.  You may have different guidelines for different types
   711	      of users (i.e., students, faculty, external users).  The policy
   712	      should state what is acceptable use as well as unacceptable use.
   713	      It should also include types of use that may be restricted.
   714	
   715	      Define limits to access and authority.  You will need to consider
   716	      the level of access various users will have and what resources
   717	      will be available or restricted to various groups of people.
   718	
   719	      Your acceptable use policy should clearly state that individual
   720	      users are responsible for their actions.  Their responsibility
   721	
   722	
   723	
   724	Site Security Policy Handbook Working Group                    [Page 13]
   725	
   726	RFC 1244                 Site Security Handbook                July 1991
   727	
   728	
   729	      exists regardless of the security mechanisms that are in place.
   730	      It should be clearly stated that breaking into accounts or
   731	      bypassing security is not permitted.
   732	
   733	      The following points should be covered when developing an
   734	      acceptable use policy:
   735	
   736	         o Is breaking into accounts permitted?
   737	         o Is cracking passwords permitted?
   738	         o Is disrupting service permitted?
   739	         o Should users assume that a file being world-readable
   740	           grants them the authorization to read it?
   741	         o Should users be permitted to modify files that are
   742	           not their own even if they happen to have write
   743	           permission?
   744	         o Should users share accounts?
   745	
   746	      The answer to most of these questions will be "no".
   747	
   748	      You may wish to incorporate a statement in your policies
   749	      concerning copyrighted and licensed software.  Licensing
   750	      agreements with vendors may require some sort of effort on your
   751	      part to ensure that the license is not violated.  In addition, you
   752	      may wish to inform users that the copying of copyrighted software
   753	      may be a violation of the copyright laws, and is not permitted.
   754	
   755	      Specifically concerning copyrighted and/or licensed software, you
   756	      may wish to include the following information:
   757	
   758	         o Copyrighted and licensed software may not be duplicated
   759	           unless it is explicitly stated that you may do so.
   760	         o Methods of conveying information on the
   761	           copyright/licensed status of software.
   762	         o When in doubt, DON'T COPY.
   763	
   764	      Your acceptable use policy is very important.  A policy which does
   765	      not clearly state what is not permitted may leave you unable to
   766	      prove that a user violated policy.
   767	
   768	      There are exception cases like tiger teams and users or
   769	      administrators wishing for "licenses to hack" -- you may face the
   770	      situation where users will want to "hack" on your services for
   771	      security research purposes.  You should develop a policy that will
   772	      determine whether you will permit this type of research on your
   773	      services and if so, what your guidelines for such research will
   774	      be.
   775	
   776	      Points you may wish to cover in this area:

   785	         o Whether it is permitted at all.
   786	         o What type of activity is permitted: breaking in, releasing
   787	           worms, releasing viruses, etc..
   788	         o What type of controls must be in place to ensure that it
   789	           does not get out of control (e.g., separate a segment of
   790	           your network for these tests).
   791	         o How you will protect other users from being victims of
   792	           these activities, including external users and networks.
   793	         o The process for obtaining permission to conduct these
   794	           tests.
   795	
   796	      In cases where you do permit these activities, you should isolate
   797	      the portions of the network that are being tested from your main
   798	      network.  Worms and viruses should never be released on a live
   799	      network.
   800	
   801	      You may also wish to employ, contract, or otherwise solicit one or
   802	      more people or organizations to evaluate the security of your
   803	      services, of which may include "hacking".  You may wish to provide
   804	      for this in your policy.
   805	
   806	   2.3.3  Who Is Authorized to Grant Access and Approve Usage?
   807	
   808	      Your policy should state who is authorized to grant access to your
   809	      services.  Further, it must be determined what type of access they
   810	      are permitted to give.  If you do not have control over who is
   811	      granted access to your system, you will not have control over who
   812	      is using your system.  Controlling who has the authorization to
   813	      grant access will also enable you to know who was or was not
   814	      granting access if problems develop later.
   815	
   816	      There are many schemes that can be developed to control the
   817	      distribution of access to your services.  The following are the
   818	      factors that you must consider when determining who will
   819	      distribute access to your services:
   820	
   821	         o Will you be distributing access from a centralized
   822	           point or at various points?
   823	
   824	      You can have a centralized distribution point to a distributed
   825	      system where various sites or departments independently authorize
   826	      access.  The trade off is between security and convenience.  The
   827	      more centralized, the easier to secure.
   828	
   829	         o What methods will you use for creating accounts and
   830	           terminating access?
   831	
   832	      From a security standpoint, you need to examine the mechanism that
   833	
   834	
   835	
   836	Site Security Policy Handbook Working Group                    [Page 15]
   837	
   838	RFC 1244                 Site Security Handbook                July 1991
   839	
   840	
   841	      you will be using to create accounts.  In the least restrictive
   842	      case, the people who are authorized to grant access would be able
   843	      to go into the system directly and create an account by hand or
   844	      through vendor supplied mechanisms.  Generally, these mechanisms
   845	      place a great deal of trust in the person running them, and the
   846	      person running them usually has a large amount of privileges.  If
   847	      this is the choice you make, you need to select someone who is
   848	      trustworthy to perform this task.  The opposite solution is to
   849	      have an integrated system that the people authorized to create
   850	      accounts run, or the users themselves may actually run.  Be aware
   851	      that even in the restrictive case of having a mechanized facility
   852	      to create accounts does not remove the potential for abuse.
   853	
   854	      You should have specific procedures developed for the creation of
   855	      accounts.  These procedures should be well documented to prevent
   856	      confusion and reduce mistakes.  A security vulnerability in the
   857	      account authorization process is not only possible through abuse,
   858	      but is also possible if a mistake is made.  Having clear and well
   859	      documented procedure will help ensure that these mistakes won't
   860	      happen.  You should also be sure that the people who will be
   861	      following these procedures understand them.
   862	
   863	      The granting of access to users is one of the most vulnerable of
   864	      times.  You should ensure that the selection of an initial
   865	      password cannot be easily guessed.  You should avoid using an
   866	      initial password that is a function of the username, is part of
   867	      the user's name, or some algorithmically generated password that
   868	      can easily be guessed.  In addition, you should not permit users
   869	      to continue to use the initial password indefinitely.  If
   870	      possible, you should force users to change the initial password
   871	      the first time they login.  Consider that some users may never
   872	      even login, leaving their password vulnerable indefinitely.  Some
   873	      sites choose to disable accounts that have never been accessed,
   874	      and force the owner to reauthorize opening the account.
   875	
   876	   2.3.4  Who May Have System Administration Privileges?
   877	
   878	      One security decision that needs to be made very carefully is who
   879	      will have access to system administrator privileges and passwords
   880	      for your services.  Obviously, the system administrators will need
   881	      access, but inevitably other users will request special
   882	      privileges.  The policy should address this issue.  Restricting
   883	      privileges is one way to deal with threats from local users.  The
   884	      challenge is to balance restricting access to these to protect
   885	      security with giving people who need these privileges access so
   886	      that they can perform their tasks.  One approach that can be taken
   887	      is to grant only enough privilege to accomplish the necessary
   888	      tasks.
   889	
   890	
   891	
   892	Site Security Policy Handbook Working Group                    [Page 16]

   894	RFC 1244                 Site Security Handbook                July 1991
   895	
   896	
   897	      Additionally, people holding special privileges should be
   898	      accountable to some authority and this should also be identified
   899	      within the site's security policy.  If the people you grant
   900	      privileges to are not accountable, you run the risk of losing
   901	      control of your system and will have difficulty managing a
   902	      compromise in security.
   903	
   904	   2.3.5  What Are The Users' Rights and Responsibilities?
   905	
   906	      The policy should incorporate a statement on the users' rights and
   907	      responsibilities concerning the use of the site's computer systems
   908	      and services.  It should be clearly stated that users are
   909	      responsible for understanding and respecting the security rules of
   910	      the systems they are using.  The following is a list of topics
   911	      that you may wish to cover in this area of the policy:
   912	
   913	         o What guidelines you have regarding resource consumption
   914	           (whether users are restricted, and if so, what the
   915	           restrictions are).
   916	         o What might constitute abuse in terms of system performance.
   917	         o Whether users are permitted to share accounts or let others
   918	           use their accounts.
   919	         o How "secret" users should keep their passwords.
   920	         o How often users should change their passwords and any other
   921	           password restrictions or requirements.
   922	         o Whether you provide backups or expect the users to create
   923	           their own.
   924	         o Disclosure of information that may be proprietary.
   925	         o Statement on Electronic Mail Privacy (Electronic
   926	           Communications Privacy Act).
   927	         o Your policy concerning controversial mail or postings to
   928	           mailing lists or discussion groups (obscenity, harassment,
   929	           etc.).
   930	         o Policy on electronic communications: mail forging, etc.
   931	
   932	      The Electronic Mail Association sponsored a white paper on the
   933	      privacy of electronic mail in companies [4].  Their basic
   934	      recommendation is that every site should have a policy on the
   935	      protection of employee privacy.  They also recommend that
   936	      organizations establish privacy policies that deal with all media,
   937	      rather than singling out electronic mail.
   938	
   939	      They suggest five criteria for evaluating any policy:
   940	
   941	         1. Does the policy comply with law and with duties to
   942	            third parties?
   943	
   944	         2. Does the policy unnecessarily compromise the interest of
   945	
   946

   950	RFC 1244                 Site Security Handbook                July 1991
   951	
   952	
   953	            the employee, the employer or third parties?
   954	
   955	         3. Is the policy workable as a practical matter and likely to
   956	            be enforced?
   957	
   958	         4. Does the policy deal appropriately with all different
   959	            forms of communications and record keeping with the office?
   960	
   961	         5. Has the policy been announced in advance and agreed to by
   962	            all concerned?
   963	
   964	   2.3.6  What Are The Rights and Responsibilities of System
   965	          Administrators Versus Rights of Users
   966	
   967	      There is a tradeoff between a user's right to absolute privacy and
   968	      the need of system administrators to gather sufficient information
   969	      to diagnose problems.  There is also a distinction between a
   970	      system administrator's need to gather information to diagnose
   971	      problems and investigating security violations.  The policy should
   972	      specify to what degree system administrators can examine user
   973	      files to diagnose problems or for other purposes, and what rights
   974	      you grant to the users.  You may also wish to make a statement
   975	      concerning system administrators' obligation to maintaining the
   976	      privacy of information viewed under these circumstances.  A few
   977	      questions that should be answered are:
   978	
   979	         o Can an administrator monitor or read a user's files
   980	           for any reason?
   981	         o What are the liabilities?
   982	         o Do network administrators have the right to examine
   983	           network or host traffic?
   984	
   985	   2.3.7  What To Do With Sensitive Information
   986	
   987	      Before granting users access to your services, you need to
   988	      determine at what level you will provide for the security of data
   989	      on your systems.  By determining this, you are determining the
   990	      level of sensitivity of data that users should store on your
   991	      systems.  You do not want users to store very sensitive
   992	      information on a system that you are not going to secure very
   993	      well.  You need to tell users who might store sensitive
   994	      information what services, if any, are appropriate for the storage
   995	      of sensitive information.  This part should include storing of
   996	      data in different ways (disk, magnetic tape, file servers, etc.).
   997	      Your policy in this area needs to be coordinated with the policy
   998	      concerning the rights of system administrators versus users (see
   999	      section 2.3.6).

  1008	
  1009	2.4  What Happens When the Policy is Violated
  1010	
  1011	   It is obvious that when any type of official policy is defined, be it
  1012	   related to computer security or not, it will eventually be broken.
  1013	   The violation may occur due to an individual's negligence, accidental
  1014	   mistake, having not been properly informed of the current policy, or
  1015	   not understanding the current policy.  It is equally possible that an
  1016	   individual (or group of individuals) may knowingly perform an act
  1017	   that is in direct violation of the defined policy.
  1018	
  1019	   When a policy violation has been detected, the immediate course of
  1020	   action should be pre-defined to ensure prompt and proper enforcement.
  1021	   An investigation should be performed to determine how and why the
  1022	   violation occurred.  Then the appropriate corrective action should be
  1023	   executed.  The type and severity of action taken varies depending on
  1024	   the type of violation that occurred.
  1025	
  1026	   2.4.1  Determining the Response to Policy Violations
  1027	
  1028	      Violations to policy may be committed by a wide variety of users.
  1029	      Some may be local users and others may be from outside the local
  1030	      environment.  Sites may find it helpful to define what it
  1031	      considers "insiders" and "outsiders" based upon administrative,
  1032	      legal or political boundaries.  These boundaries imply what type
  1033	      of action must be taken to correct the offending party; from a
  1034	      written reprimand to pressing legal charges.  So, not only do you
  1035	      need to define actions based on the type of violation, you also
  1036	      need to have a clearly defined series of actions based on the kind
  1037	      of user violating your computer security policy.  This all seems
  1038	      rather complicated, but should be addressed long before it becomes
  1039	      necessary as the result of a violation.
  1040	
  1041	      One point to remember about your policy is that proper education
  1042	      is your best defense.  For the outsiders who are using your
  1043	      computer legally, it is your responsibility to verify that these
  1044	      individuals are aware of the policies that you have set forth.
  1045	      Having this proof may assist you in the future if legal action
  1046	      becomes necessary.
  1047	
  1048	      As for users who are using your computer illegally, the problem is
  1049	      basically the same.  What type of user violated the policy and how
  1050	      and why did they do it?  Depending on the results of your
  1051	      investigation, you may just prefer to "plug" the hole in your
  1052	      computer security and chalk it up to experience.  Or if a
  1053	      significant amount of loss was incurred, you may wish to take more
  1054	      drastic action.

  1065	   2.4.2  What to do When Local Users Violate the Policy of a Remote
  1066	          Site
  1067	
  1068	      In the event that a local user violates the security policy of a
  1069	      remote site, the local site should have a clearly defined set of
  1070	      administrative actions to take concerning that local user.  The
  1071	      site should also be prepared to protect itself against possible
  1072	      actions by the remote site.  These situations involve legal issues
  1073	      which should be addressed when forming the security policy.
  1074	
  1075	   2.4.3  Defining Contacts and Responsibilities to Outside
  1076	          Organizations
  1077	
  1078	      The local security policy should include procedures for
  1079	      interaction with outside organizations.  These include law
  1080	      enforcement agencies, other sites, external response team
  1081	      organizations (e.g., the CERT, CIAC) and various press agencies.
  1082	      The procedure should state who is authorized to make such contact
  1083	      and how it should be handled.  Some questions to be answered
  1084	      include:
  1085	
  1086	         o Who may talk to the press?
  1087	         o When do you contact law enforcement and investigative agencies?
  1088	         o If a connection is made from a remote site, is the
  1089	           system manager authorized to contact that site?
  1090	         o Can data be released?  What kind?
  1091	
  1092	      Detailed contact information should be readily available along
  1093	      with clearly defined procedures to follow.
  1094	
  1095	   2.4.4  What are the Responsibilities to our Neighbors and Other
  1096	          Internet Sites?
  1097	
  1098	      The Security Policy Working Group within the IETF is working on a
  1099	      document entitled, "Policy Guidelines for the Secure Operation of
  1100	      the Internet" [23].  It addresses the issue that the Internet is a
  1101	      cooperative venture and that sites are expected to provide mutual
  1102	      security assistance.  This should be addressed when developing a
  1103	      site's policy.  The major issue to be determined is how much
  1104	      information should be released.  This will vary from site to site
  1105	      according to the type of site (e.g., military, education,
  1106	      commercial) as well as the type of security violation that
  1107	      occurred.
  1108	
  1109	   2.4.5  Issues for Incident Handling Procedures
  1110	
  1111	      Along with statements of policy, the document being prepared
  1112	      should include procedures for incident handling.  This is covered
  1113

  1120	
  1121	      in detail in the next chapter.  There should be procedures
  1122	      available that cover all facets of policy violation.
  1123	
  1124	2.5  Locking In or Out
  1125	
  1126	   Whenever a site suffers an incident which may compromise computer
  1127	   security, the strategies for reacting may be influenced by two
  1128	   opposing pressures.
  1129	
  1130	   If management fears that the site is sufficiently vulnerable, it may
  1131	   choose a "Protect and Proceed" strategy.  This approach will have as
  1132	   its primary goal the protection and preservation of the site
  1133	   facilities and to provide for normalcy for its users as quickly as
  1134	   possible.  Attempts will be made to actively interfere with the
  1135	   intruder's processes, prevent further access and begin immediate
  1136	   damage assessment and recovery.  This process may involve shutting
  1137	   down the facilities, closing off access to the network, or other
  1138	   drastic measures.  The drawback is that unless the intruder is
  1139	   identified directly, they may come back into the site via a different
  1140	   path, or may attack another site.
  1141	
  1142	   The alternate approach, "Pursue and Prosecute", adopts the opposite
  1143	   philosophy and goals.  The primary goal is to allow intruders to
  1144	   continue their activities at the site until the site can identify the
  1145	   responsible persons.  This approach is endorsed by law enforcement
  1146	   agencies and prosecutors.  The drawback is that the agencies cannot
  1147	   exempt a site from possible user lawsuits if damage is done to their
  1148	   systems and data.
  1149	
  1150	   Prosecution is not the only outcome possible if the intruder is
  1151	   identified.  If the culprit is an employee or a student, the
  1152	   organization may choose to take disciplinary actions.  The computer
  1153	   security policy needs to spell out the choices and how they will be
  1154	   selected if an intruder is caught.
  1155	
  1156	   Careful consideration must be made by site management regarding their
  1157	   approach to this issue before the problem occurs.  The strategy
  1158	   adopted might depend upon each circumstance.  Or there may be a
  1159	   global policy which mandates one approach in all circumstances.  The
  1160	   pros and cons must be examined thoroughly and the users of the
  1161	   facilities must be made aware of the policy so that they understand
  1162	   their vulnerabilities no matter which approach is taken.
  1163	
  1164	   The following are checklists to help a site determine which strategy
  1165	   to adopt: "Protect and Proceed" or "Pursue and Prosecute".

  1196	
  1197	      1. If assets and systems are well protected.
  1198	
  1199	      2. If good backups are available.
  1200	
  1201	      3. If the risk to the assets is outweighed by the
  1202	         disruption caused by the present and possibly future
  1203	         penetrations.
  1204	
  1205	      4. If this is a concentrated attack occurring with great
  1206	         frequency and intensity.
  1207

  1223	      10. If there is willingness on the part of management to
  1224	          prosecute.

  1242	      14. If the site is prepared for possible legal action from
  1243	          its own users if their data or systems become compromised
  1244	          during the pursuit.
  1245	
  1246	2.6  Interpreting the Policy
  1247	
  1248	   It is important to define who will interpret the policy.  This could
  1249	   be an individual or a committee.  No matter how well written, the
  1250	   policy will require interpretation from time to time and this body
  1251	   would serve to review, interpret, and revise the policy as needed.
  1252	
  1253	2.7  Publicizing the Policy
  1254	
  1255	   Once the site security policy has been written and established, a
  1256	   vigorous process should be engaged to ensure that the policy
  1257	   statement is widely and thoroughly disseminated and discussed.  A
  1258	   mailing of the policy should not be considered sufficient.  A period
  1259	   for comments should be allowed before the policy becomes effective to
  1260	   ensure that all affected users have a chance to state their reactions
  1261	   and discuss any unforeseen ramifications.  Ideally, the policy should
  1262	   strike a balance between protection and productivity.
  1263	
  1264	   Meetings should be held to elicit these comments, and also to ensure
  1265	   that the policy is correctly understood.  (Policy promulgators are
  1266	   not necessarily noted for their skill with the language.)  These
  1267	   meetings should involve higher management as well as line employees.
  1268	   Security is a collective effort.
  1269	
  1270	   In addition to the initial efforts to publicize the policy, it is
  1271	   essential for the site to maintain a continual awareness of its
  1272	   computer security policy.  Current users may need periodic reminders
  1273	   New users should have the policy included as part of their site
  1274	   introduction packet.  As a condition for using the site facilities,
  1275	   it may be advisable to have them sign a statement that they have read
  1276	   and understood the policy.  Should any of these users require legal
  1277	   action for serious policy violations, this signed statement might
  1278	   prove to be a valuable aid.

  1289	3.  Establishing Procedures to Prevent Security Problems
  1290	
  1291	   The security policy defines what needs to be protected.  This section
  1292	   discusses security procedures which specify what steps will be used
  1293	   to carry out the security policy.
  1294	
  1295	3.1  Security Policy Defines What Needs to be Protected
  1296	
  1297	   The security policy defines the WHAT's: what needs to be protected,
  1298	   what is most important, what the priorities are, and what the general
  1299	   approach to dealing with security problems should be.
  1300	
  1301	   The security policy by itself doesn't say HOW things are protected.
  1302	   That is the role of security procedures, which this section
  1303	   discusses.  The security policy should be a high level document,
  1304	   giving general strategy.  The security procedures need to set out, in
  1305	   detail, the precise steps your site will take to protect itself.
  1306	
  1307	   The security policy should include a general risk assessment of the
  1308	   types of threats a site is mostly likely to face and the consequences
  1309	   of those threats (see section 2.2).  Part of doing a risk assessment
  1310	   will include creating a general list of assets that should be
  1311	   protected (section 2.2.2).  This information is critical in devising
  1312	   cost-effective procedures.
  1313	
  1314	   It is often tempting to start creating security procedures by
  1315	   deciding on different mechanisms first: "our site should have logging
  1316	   on all hosts, call-back modems, and smart cards for all users."  This
  1317	   approach could lead to some areas that have too much protection for
  1318	   the risk they face, and other areas that aren't protected enough.
  1319	   Starting with the security policy and the risks it outlines should
  1320	   ensure that the procedures provide the right level of protect for all
  1321	   assets.
  1322	
  1323	3.2  Identifing Possible Problems
  1324	
  1325	   To determine risk, vulnerabilities must be identified.  Part of the
  1326	   purpose of the policy is to aid in shoring up the vulnerabilities and
  1327	   thus to decrease the risk in as many areas as possible.  Several of
  1328	   the more popular problem areas are presented in sections below.  This
  1329	   list is by no means complete.  In addition, each site is likely to
  1330	   have a few unique vulnerabilities.
  1331	
  1332	   3.2.1  Access Points
  1333	
  1334	      Access points are typically used for entry by unauthorized users.
  1335	      Having many access points increases the risk of access to an
  1336	      organization's computer and network facilities.
  1337

  1343	
  1344	
  1345	      Network links to networks outside the organization allow access
  1346	      into the organization for all others connected to that external
  1347	      network.  A network link typically provides access to a large
  1348	      number of network services, and each service has a potential to be
  1349	      compromised.
  1350	
  1351	      Dialup lines, depending on their configuration, may provide access
  1352	      merely to a login port of a single system.  If connected to a
  1353	      terminal server, the dialup line may give access to the entire
  1354	      network.
  1355	
  1356	      Terminal servers themselves can be a source of problem.  Many
  1357	      terminal servers do not require any kind of authentication.
  1358	      Intruders often use terminal servers to disguise their actions,
  1359	      dialing in on a local phone and then using the terminal server to
  1360	      go out to the local network.  Some terminal servers are configured
  1361	      so that intruders can TELNET [19] in from outside the network, and
  1362	      then TELNET back out again, again serving to make it difficult to
  1363	      trace them.
  1364	
  1365	   3.2.2  Misconfigured Systems
  1366	
  1367	      Misconfigured systems form a large percentage of security holes.
  1368	      Today's operating systems and their associated software have
  1369	      become so complex that understanding how the system works has
  1370	      become a full-time job.  Often, systems managers will be non-
  1371	      specialists chosen from the current organization's staff.
  1372	
  1373	      Vendors are also partly responsible for misconfigured systems. To
  1374	      make the system installation process easier, vendors occasionally
  1375	      choose initial configurations that are not secure in all
  1376	      environments.
  1377	
  1378	   3.2.3  Software Bugs
  1379	
  1380	      Software will never be bug free.  Publicly known security bugs are
  1381	      common methods of unauthorized entry.  Part of the solution to
  1382	      this problem is to be aware of the security problems and to update
  1383	      the software when problems are detected.  When bugs are found,
  1384	      they should be reported to the vendor so that a solution to the
  1385	      problem can be implemented and distributed.
  1386	
  1387	   3.2.4  "Insider" Threats
  1388	
  1389	      An insider to the organization may be a considerable threat to the
  1390	      security of the computer systems.  Insiders often have direct
  1391	      access to the computer and network hardware components.  The
  1392	      ability to access the components of a system makes most systems
  1393	
  1394	
  1395	
  1396	Site Security Policy Handbook Working Group                    [Page 25]

  1399	
  1400	
  1401	      easier to compromise.  Most desktop workstations can be easily
  1402	      manipulated so that they grant privileged access.  Access to a
  1403	      local area network provides the ability to view possibly sensitive
  1404	      data traversing the network.
  1405	
  1406	3.3  Choose Controls to Protect Assets in a Cost-Effective Way
  1407	
  1408	   After establishing what is to be protected, and assessing the risks
  1409	   these assets face, it is necessary to decide how to implement the
  1410	   controls which protect these assets.  The controls and protection
  1411	   mechanisms should be selected in a way so as to adequately counter
  1412	   the threats found during risk assessment, and to implement those
  1413	   controls in a cost effective manner.  It makes little sense to spend
  1414	   an exorbitant sum of money and overly constrict the user base if the
  1415	   risk of exposure is very small.
  1416	
  1417	   3.3.1  Choose the Right Set of Controls
  1418	
  1419	      The controls that are selected represent the physical embodiment
  1420	      of your security policy.  They are the first and primary line of
  1421	      defense in the protection of your assets.  It is therefore most
  1422	      important to ensure that the controls that you select are the
  1423	      right set of controls.  If the major threat to your system is
  1424	      outside penetrators, it probably doesn't make much sense to use
  1425	      biometric devices to authenticate your regular system users.  On
  1426	      the other hand, if the major threat is unauthorized use of
  1427	      computing resources by regular system users, you'll probably want
  1428	      to establish very rigorous automated accounting procedures.
  1429	
  1430	   3.3.2  Use Common Sense
  1431	
  1432	      Common sense is the most appropriate tool that can be used to
  1433	      establish your security policy.  Elaborate security schemes and
  1434	      mechanisms are impressive, and they do have their place, yet there
  1435	      is little point in investing money and time on an elaborate
  1436	      implementation scheme if the simple controls are forgotten.  For
  1437	      example, no matter how elaborate a system you put into place on
  1438	      top of existing security controls, a single user with a poor
  1439	      password can still leave your system open to attack.
  1440	
  1441	3.4  Use Multiple Strategies to Protect Assets
  1442	
  1443	   Another method of protecting assets is to use multiple strategies.
  1444	   In this way, if one strategy fails or is circumvented, another
  1445	   strategy comes into play to continue protecting the asset.  By using
  1446	   several simpler strategies, a system can often be made more secure
  1447	   than if one very sophisticated method were used in its place.  For
  1448	   example, dial-back modems can be used in conjunction with traditional
  1449	
  1450	
  1451	
  1452	Site Security Policy Handbook Working Group                    [Page 26]

  1455	
  1456	
  1457	   logon mechanisms.  Many similar approaches could be devised that
  1458	   provide several levels of protection for assets.  However, it's very
  1459	   easy to go overboard with extra mechanisms.  One must keep in mind
  1460	   exactly what it is that needs to be protected.
  1461	
  1462	3.5  Physical Security
  1463	
  1464	   It is a given in computer security if the system itself is not
  1465	   physically secure, nothing else about the system can be considered
  1466	   secure.  With physical access to a machine, an intruder can halt the
  1467	   machine, bring it back up in privileged mode, replace or alter the
  1468	   disk, plant Trojan horse programs (see section 2.13.9.2), or take any
  1469	   number of other undesirable (and hard to prevent) actions.
  1470	
  1471	   Critical communications links, important servers, and other key
  1472	   machines should be located in physically secure areas.  Some security
  1473	   systems (such as Kerberos) require that the machine be physically
  1474	   secure.
  1475	
  1476	   If you cannot physically secure machines, care should be taken about
  1477	   trusting those machines.  Sites should consider limiting access from
  1478	   non-secure machines to more secure machines.  In particular, allowing
  1479	   trusted access (e.g., the BSD Unix remote commands such as rsh) from
  1480	   these kinds of hosts is particularly risky.
  1481	
  1482	   For machines that seem or are intended to be physically secure, care
  1483	   should be taken about who has access to the machines.  Remember that
  1484	   custodial and maintenance staff often have keys to rooms.
  1485	
  1486	3.6   Procedures to Recognize Unauthorized Activity
  1487	
  1488	   Several simple procedures can be used to detect most unauthorized
  1489	   uses of a computer system.  These procedures use tools provided with
  1490	   the operating system by the vendor, or tools publicly available from
  1491	   other sources.
  1492	
  1493	   3.6.1  Monitoring System Use
  1494	
  1495	      System monitoring can be done either by a system administrator, or
  1496	      by software written for the purpose.  Monitoring a system involves
  1497	      looking at several parts of the system and searching for anything
  1498	      unusual.  Some of the easier ways to do this are described in this
  1499	      section.
  1500	
  1501	      The most important thing about monitoring system use is that it be
  1502	      done on a regular basis.  Picking one day out of the month to
  1503	      monitor the system is pointless, since a security breach can be
  1504	      isolated to a matter of hours.  Only by maintaining a constant
  1505

  1515	
  1516	   3.6.2  Tools for Monitoring the System
  1517	
  1518	      This section describes tools and methods for monitoring a system
  1519	      against unauthorized access and use.
  1520	
  1521	      3.6.2.1  Logging
  1522	
  1523	         Most operating systems store numerous bits of information in
  1524	         log files.  Examination of these log files on a regular basis
  1525	         is often the first line of defense in detecting unauthorized
  1526	         use of the system.
  1527	
  1528	            - Compare lists of currently logged in users and past
  1529	              login histories.  Most users typically log in and out
  1530	              at roughly the same time each day.  An account logged
  1531	              in outside the "normal" time for the account may be in
  1532	              use by an intruder.
  1533	
  1534	            - Many systems maintain accounting records for billing
  1535	              purposes.  These records can also be used to determine
  1536	              usage patterns for the system; unusual accounting records
  1537	              may indicate unauthorized use of the system.
  1538	
  1539	            - System logging facilities, such as the UNIX "syslog"
  1540	              utility, should be checked for unusual error messages
  1541	              from system software.  For example, a large number of
  1542	              failed login attempts in a short period of time may
  1543	              indicate someone trying to guess passwords.
  1544	
  1545	            - Operating system commands which list currently executing
  1546	              processes can be used to detect users running programs
  1547	              they are not authorized to use, as well as to detect
  1548	              unauthorized programs which have been started by an
  1549	              intruder.

  1551	      3.6.2.2  Monitoring Software
  1552	
  1553	         Other monitoring tools can easily be constructed using standard
  1554	         operating system software, by using several, often unrelated,
  1555	         programs together.  For example, checklists of file ownerships
  1556	         and permission settings can be constructed (for example, with
  1557	         "ls" and "find" on UNIX) and stored off-line.  These lists can
  1558	         then be reconstructed periodically and compared against the
  1559	         master checklist (on UNIX, by using the "diff" utility).
  1560	         Differences may indicate that unauthorized modifications have

  1568	
  1569	         been made to the system.
  1570	
  1571	         Still other tools are available from third-party vendors and
  1572	         public software distribution sites.  Section 3.9.9 lists
  1573	         several sources from which you can learn what tools are
  1574	         available and how to get them.
  1575	
  1576	      3.6.2.3  Other Tools
  1577	
  1578	         Other tools can also be used to monitor systems for security
  1579	         violations, although this is not their primary purpose.  For
  1580	         example, network monitors can be used to detect and log
  1581	         connections from unknown sites.
  1582	
  1583	   3.6.3  Vary the Monitoring Schedule
  1584	
  1585	      The task of system monitoring is not as daunting as it may seem.
  1586	      System administrators can execute many of the commands used for
  1587	      monitoring periodically throughout the day during idle moments
  1588	      (e.g., while talking on the telephone), rather than spending fixed
  1589	      periods of each day monitoring the system.  By executing the
  1590	      commands frequently, you will rapidly become used to seeing
  1591	      "normal" output, and will easily spot things which are out of the
  1592	      ordinary.  In addition, by running various monitoring commands at
  1593	      different times throughout the day, you make it hard for an
  1594	      intruder to predict your actions.  For example, if an intruder
  1595	      knows that each day at 5:00 p.m. the system is checked to see that
  1596	      everyone has logged off, he will simply wait until after the check
  1597	      has completed before logging in.  But the intruder cannot guess
  1598	      when a system administrator might type a command to display all
  1599	      logged-in users, and thus he runs a much greater risk of
  1600	      detection.
  1601	
  1602	      Despite the advantages that regular system monitoring provides,
  1603	      some intruders will be aware of the standard logging mechanisms in
  1604	      use on systems they are attacking.  They will actively pursue and
  1605	      attempt to disable monitoring mechanisms.  Regular monitoring
  1606	      therefore is useful in detecting intruders, but does not provide
  1607	      any guarantee that your system is secure, nor should monitoring be
  1608	      considered an infallible method of detecting unauthorized use.
  1609	
  1610	3.7  Define Actions to Take When Unauthorized Activity is Suspected
  1611	
  1612	      Sections 2.4 and 2.5 discussed the course of action a site should
  1613	      take when it suspects its systems are being abused.  The computer
  1614	      security policy should state the general approach towards dealing
  1615	      with these problems.
  1616	
  1617

  1623	
  1624	
  1625	      The procedures for dealing with these types of problems should be
  1626	      written down.  Who has authority to decide what actions will be
  1627	      taken?  Should law enforcement be involved?  Should your
  1628	      organization cooperate with other sites in trying to track down an
  1629	      intruder?  Answers to all the questions in section 2.4 should be
  1630	      part of the incident handling procedures.
  1631	
  1632	      Whether you decide to lock out or pursue intruders, you should
  1633	      have tools and procedures ready to apply.  It is best to work up
  1634	      these tools and procedures before you need them.  Don't wait until
  1635	      an intruder is on your system to figure out how to track the
  1636	      intruder's actions; you will be busy enough if an intruder
  1637	      strikes.
  1638	
  1639	3.8  Communicating Security Policy
  1640	
  1641	   Security policies, in order to be effective, must be communicated to
  1642	   both the users of the system and the system maintainers.  This
  1643	   section describes what these people should be told, and how to tell
  1644	   them.
  1645	
  1646	   3.8.1  Educating the Users
  1647	
  1648	      Users should be made aware of how the computer systems are
  1649	      expected to be used, and how to protect themselves from
  1650	      unauthorized users.
  1651	
  1652	      3.8.1.1  Proper Account/Workstation Use
  1653	
  1654	         All users should be informed about what is considered the
  1655	         "proper" use of their account or workstation ("proper" use is
  1656	         discussed in section 2.3.2).  This can most easily be done at
  1657	         the time a user receives their account, by giving them a policy
  1658	         statement.  Proper use policies typically dictate things such
  1659	         as whether or not the account or workstation may be used for
  1660	         personal activities (such as checkbook balancing or letter
  1661	         writing), whether profit-making activities are allowed, whether
  1662	         game playing is permitted, and so on.  These policy statements
  1663	         may also be used to summarize how the computer facility is
  1664	         licensed and what software licenses are held by the
  1665	         institution; for example, many universities have educational
  1666	         licenses which explicitly prohibit commercial uses of the
  1667	         system.  A more complete list of items to consider when writing
  1668	         a policy statement is given in section 2.3.
  1669	
  1670	      3.8.1.2  Account/Workstation Management Procedures
  1671	
  1672	         Each user should be told how to properly manage their account
  1673	
  1674

  1680	
  1681	         and workstation.  This includes explaining how to protect files
  1682	         stored on the system, how to log out or lock the terminal or
  1683	         workstation, and so on.  Much of this information is typically
  1684	         covered in the "beginning user" documentation provided by the
  1685	         operating system vendor, although many sites elect to
  1686	         supplement this material with local information.
  1687	
  1688	         If your site offers dial-up modem access to the computer
  1689	         systems, special care must be taken to inform users of the
  1690	         security problems inherent in providing this access.  Issues
  1691	         such as making sure to log out before hanging up the modem
  1692	         should be covered when the user is initially given dial-up
  1693	         access.
  1694	
  1695	         Likewise, access to the systems via local and wide-area
  1696	         networks presents its own set of security problems which users
  1697	         should be made aware of.  Files which grant "trusted host" or
  1698	         "trusted user" status to remote systems and users should be
  1699	         carefully explained.
  1700	
  1701	      3.8.1.3  Determining Account Misuse
  1702	
  1703	         Users should be told how to detect unauthorized access to their
  1704	         account.  If the system prints the last login time when a user
  1705	         logs in, he or she should be told to check that time and note
  1706	         whether or not it agrees with the last time he or she actually
  1707	         logged in.
  1708	
  1709	         Command interpreters on some systems (e.g., the UNIX C shell)
  1710	         maintain histories of the last several commands executed.
  1711	         Users should check these histories to be sure someone has not
  1712	         executed other commands with their account.
  1713	
  1714	      3.8.1.4  Problem Reporting Procedures
  1715	
  1716	         A procedure should be developed to enable users to report
  1717	         suspected misuse of their accounts or other misuse they may
  1718	         have noticed.  This can be done either by providing the name
  1719	         and telephone number of a system administrator who manages
  1720	         security of the computer system, or by creating an electronic
  1721	         mail address (e.g., "security") to which users can address
  1722	         their problems.
  1723	
  1724	   3.8.2  Educating the Host Administrators
  1725	
  1726	      In many organizations, computer systems are administered by a wide
  1727	      variety of people.  These administrators must know how to protect
  1728	      their own systems from attack and unauthorized use, as well as how
  1729	
  1730	
  1731	
  1732	Site Security Policy Handbook Working Group                    [Page 31]

  1735	
  1736	
  1737	      to communicate successful penetration of their systems to other
  1738	      administrators as a warning.
  1739	
  1740	      3.8.2.1  Account Management Procedures
  1741	
  1742	         Care must be taken when installing accounts on the system in
  1743	         order to make them secure.  When installing a system from
  1744	         distribution media, the password file should be examined for
  1745	         "standard" accounts provided by the vendor.  Many vendors
  1746	         provide accounts for use by system services or field service
  1747	         personnel.  These accounts typically have either no password or
  1748	         one which is common knowledge.  These accounts should be given
  1749	         new passwords if they are needed, or disabled or deleted from
  1750	         the system if they are not.
  1751	
  1752	         Accounts without passwords are generally very dangerous since
  1753	         they allow anyone to access the system.  Even accounts which do
  1754	         not execute a command interpreter (e.g., accounts which exist
  1755	         only to see who is logged in to the system) can be compromised
  1756	         if set up incorrectly.  A related concept, that of "anonymous"
  1757	         file transfer (FTP) [20], allows users from all over the
  1758	         network to access your system to retrieve files from (usually)
  1759	         a protected disk area.  You should carefully weigh the benefits
  1760	         that an account without a password provides against the
  1761	         security risks of providing such access to your system.
  1762	
  1763	         If the operating system provides a "shadow" password facility
  1764	         which stores passwords in a separate file accessible only to
  1765	         privileged users, this facility should be used.  System V UNIX,
  1766	         SunOS 4.0 and above, and versions of Berkeley UNIX after 4.3BSD
  1767	         Tahoe, as well as others, provide this feature.  It protects
  1768	         passwords by hiding their encrypted values from unprivileged
  1769	         users.  This prevents an attacker from copying your password
  1770	         file to his or her machine and then attempting to break the
  1771	         passwords at his or her leisure.
  1772	
  1773	         Keep track of who has access to privileged user accounts (e.g.,
  1774	         "root" on UNIX or "MAINT" on VMS).  Whenever a privileged user
  1775	         leaves the organization or no longer has need of the privileged
  1776	         account, the passwords on all privileged accounts should be
  1777	         changed.
  1778	
  1779	      3.8.2.2  Configuration Management Procedures
  1780	
  1781	         When installing a system from the distribution media or when
  1782	         installing third-party software, it is important to check the
  1783	         installation carefully.  Many installation procedures assume a
  1784	         "trusted" site, and hence will install files with world write
  1785	
  1786	
  1787	
  1788	Site Security Policy Handbook Working Group                    [Page 32]

  1791	
  1792	
  1793	         permission enabled, or otherwise compromise the security of
  1794	         files.
  1795	
  1796	         Network services should also be examined carefully when first
  1797	         installed.  Many vendors provide default network permission
  1798	         files which imply that all outside hosts are to be "trusted",
  1799	         which is rarely the case when connected to wide-area networks
  1800	         such as the Internet.
  1801	
  1802	         Many intruders collect information on the vulnerabilities of
  1803	         particular system versions.  The older a system, the more
  1804	         likely it is that there are security problems in that version
  1805	         which have since been fixed by the vendor in a later release.
  1806	         For this reason, it is important to weigh the risks of not
  1807	         upgrading to a new operating system release (thus leaving
  1808	         security holes unplugged) against the cost of upgrading to the
  1809	         new software (possibly breaking third-party software, etc.).
  1810	         Bug fixes from the vendor should be weighed in a similar
  1811	         fashion, with the added note that "security" fixes from a
  1812	         vendor usually address fairly serious security problems.
  1813	
  1814	         Other bug fixes, received via network mailing lists and the
  1815	         like, should usually be installed, but not without careful
  1816	         examination.  Never install a bug fix unless you're sure you
  1817	         know what the consequences of the fix are - there's always the
  1818	         possibility that an intruder has suggested a "fix" which
  1819	         actually gives him or her access to your system.
  1820	
  1821	      3.8.2.3  Recovery Procedures - Backups
  1822	
  1823	         It is impossible to overemphasize the need for a good backup
  1824	         strategy.  File system backups not only protect you in the
  1825	         event of hardware failure or accidental deletions, but they
  1826	         also protect you against unauthorized changes made by an
  1827	         intruder.  Without a copy of your data the way it's "supposed"
  1828	         to be, it can be difficult to undo something an attacker has
  1829	         done.
  1830	
  1831	         Backups, especially if run daily, can also be useful in
  1832	         providing a history of an intruder's activities.  Looking
  1833	         through old backups can establish when your system was first
  1834	         penetrated.  Intruders may leave files around which, although
  1835	         deleted later, are captured on the backup tapes.  Backups can
  1836	         also be used to document an intruder's activities to law
  1837	         enforcement agencies if necessary.
  1838	
  1839	         A good backup strategy will dump the entire system to tape at
  1840	         least once a month.  Partial (or "incremental") dumps should be
  1841	
  1842

  1848	
  1849	         done at least twice a week, and ideally they should be done
  1850	         daily.  Commands specifically designed for performing file
  1851	         system backups (e.g., UNIX "dump" or VMS "BACKUP") should be
  1852	         used in preference to other file copying commands, since these
  1853	         tools are designed with the express intent of restoring a
  1854	         system to a known state.
  1855	
  1856	      3.8.2.4  Problem Reporting Procedures
  1857	
  1858	         As with users, system administrators should have a defined
  1859	         procedure for reporting security problems.  In large
  1860	         installations, this is often done by creating an electronic
  1861	         mail alias which contains the names of all system
  1862	         administrators in the organization.  Other methods include
  1863	         setting up some sort of response team similar to the CERT, or
  1864	         establishing a "hotline" serviced by an existing support group.
  1865	
  1866	3.9  Resources to Prevent Security Breaches
  1867	
  1868	   This section discusses software, hardware, and procedural resources
  1869	   that can be used to support your site security policy.
  1870	
  1871	   3.9.1  Network Connections and Firewalls
  1872	
  1873	      A "firewall" is put in place in a building to provide a point of
  1874	      resistance to the entry of flames into another area.  Similarly, a
  1875	      secretary's desk and reception area provides a point of
  1876	      controlling access to other office spaces.  This same technique
  1877	      can be applied to a computer site, particularly as it pertains to
  1878	      network connections.
  1879	
  1880	      Some sites will be connected only to other sites within the same
  1881	      organization and will not have the ability to connect to other
  1882	      networks.  Sites such as these are less susceptible to threats
  1883	      from outside their own organization, although intrusions may still
  1884	      occur via paths such as dial-up modems.  On the other hand, many
  1885	      other organizations will be connected to other sites via much
  1886	      larger networks, such as the Internet.  These sites are
  1887	      susceptible to the entire range of threats associated with a
  1888	      networked environment.
  1889	
  1890	      The risks of connecting to outside networks must be weighed
  1891	      against the benefits.  It may be desirable to limit connection to
  1892	      outside networks to those hosts which do not store sensitive
  1893	      material, keeping "vital" machines (such as those which maintain
  1894	      company payroll or inventory systems) isolated.  If there is a
  1895	      need to participate in a Wide Area Network (WAN), consider
  1896	      restricting all access to your local network through a single
  1897

  1906	      must be made through a single host computer that acts as a
  1907	      firewall between you and the outside world.  This firewall system
  1908	      should be rigorously controlled and password protected, and
  1909	      external users accessing it should also be constrained by
  1910	      restricting the functionality available to remote users.  By using
  1911	      this approach, your site could relax some of the internal security
  1912	      controls on your local net, but still be afforded the protection
  1913	      of a rigorously controlled host front end.
  1914	
  1915	      Note that even with a firewall system, compromise of the firewall
  1916	      could result in compromise of the network behind the firewall.
  1917	      Work has been done in some areas to construct a firewall which
  1918	      even when compromised, still protects the local network [6,
  1919	      CHESWICK].
  1920	
  1921	   3.9.2  Confidentiality
  1922	
  1923	      Confidentiality, the act of keeping things hidden or secret, is
  1924	      one of the primary goals of computer security practitioners.
  1925	      Several mechanisms are provided by most modern operating systems
  1926	      to enable users to control the dissemination of information.
  1927	      Depending upon where you work, you may have a site where
  1928	      everything is protected, or a site where all information is
  1929	      usually regarded as public, or something in-between.  Most sites
  1930	      lean toward the in-between, at least until some penetration has
  1931	      occurred.
  1932	
  1933	      Generally, there are three instances in which information is
  1934	      vulnerable to disclosure: when the information is stored on a
  1935	      computer system, when the information is in transit to another
  1936	      system (on the network), and when the information is stored on
  1937	      backup tapes.
  1938	
  1939	      The first of these cases is controlled by file permissions, access
  1940	      control lists, and other similar mechanisms.  The last can be
  1941	      controlled by restricting access to the backup tapes (by locking
  1942	      them in a safe, for example).  All three cases can be helped by
  1943	      using encryption mechanisms.
  1944	
  1945	      3.9.2.1  Encryption (hardware and software)
  1946	
  1947	         Encryption is the process of taking information that exists in
  1948	         some readable form and converting it into a non-readable form.
  1949	         There are several types of commercially available encryption
  1950	         packages in both hardware and software forms.  Hardware
  1951	         encryption engines have the advantage that they are much faster
  1952	         than the software equivalent, yet because they are faster, they

  1960	
  1961	         are of greater potential benefit to an attacker who wants to
  1962	         execute a brute-force attack on your encrypted information.
  1963	
  1964	         The advantage of using encryption is that, even if other access
  1965	         control mechanisms (passwords, file permissions, etc.) are
  1966	         compromised by an intruder, the data is still unusable.
  1967	         Naturally, encryption keys and the like should be protected at
  1968	         least as well as account passwords.
  1969	
  1970	         Information in transit (over a network) may be vulnerable to
  1971	         interception as well.  Several solutions to this exist, ranging
  1972	         from simply encrypting files before transferring them (end-to-
  1973	         end encryption) to special network hardware which encrypts
  1974	         everything it sends without user intervention (secure links).
  1975	         The Internet as a whole does not use secure links, thus end-
  1976	         to-end encryption must be used if encryption is desired across
  1977	         the Internet.
  1978	
  1979	         3.9.2.1.1  Data Encryption Standard (DES)
  1980	
  1981	            DES is perhaps the most widely used data encryption
  1982	            mechanism today.  Many hardware and software implementations
  1983	            exist, and some commercial computers are provided with a
  1984	            software version.  DES transforms plain text information
  1985	            into encrypted data (or ciphertext) by means of a special
  1986	            algorithm and "seed" value called a key.  So long as the key
  1987	            is retained (or remembered) by the original user, the
  1988	            ciphertext can be restored to the original plain text.
  1989	
  1990	            One of the pitfalls of all encryption systems is the need to
  1991	            remember the key under which a thing was encrypted (this is
  1992	            not unlike the password problem discussed elsewhere in this
  1993	            document).  If the key is written down, it becomes less
  1994	            secure.  If forgotten, there is little (if any) hope of
  1995	            recovering the original data.
  1996	
  1997	            Most UNIX systems provide a DES command that enables a user
  1998	            to encrypt data using the DES algorithm.
  1999	
  2000	         3.9.2.1.2  Crypt
  2001	
  2002	            Similar to the DES command, the UNIX "crypt" command allows
  2003	            a user to encrypt data.  Unfortunately, the algorithm used
  2004	            by "crypt" is very insecure (based on the World War II
  2005	            "Enigma" device), and files encrypted with this command can
  2006	            be decrypted easily in a matter of a few hours.  Generally,
  2007	            use of the "crypt" command should be avoided for any but the
  2008	            most trivial encryption tasks.

  2017	      3.9.2.2  Privacy Enhanced Mail
  2018	
  2019	         Electronic mail normally transits the network in the clear
  2020	         (i.e., anyone can read it).  This is obviously not the optimal
  2021	         solution.  Privacy enhanced mail provides a means to
  2022	         automatically encrypt electronic mail messages so that a person
  2023	         eavesdropping at a mail distribution node is not (easily)
  2024	         capable of reading them.  Several privacy enhanced mail
  2025	         packages are currently being developed and deployed on the
  2026	         Internet.
  2027	
  2028	         The Internet Activities Board Privacy Task Force has defined a
  2029	         draft standard, elective protocol for use in implementing
  2030	         privacy enhanced mail.  This protocol is defined in RFCs 1113,
  2031	         1114, and 1115 [7,8,9].  Please refer to the current edition of
  2032	         the "IAB Official Protocol Standards" (currently, RFC 1200
  2033	         [21]) for the standardization state and status of these
  2034	         protocols.
  2035	
  2036	   3.9.3  Origin Authentication
  2037	
  2038	      We mostly take it on faith that the header of an electronic mail
  2039	      message truly indicates the originator of a message.  However, it
  2040	      iseasy to "spoof", or forge the source of a mail message.  Origin
  2041	      authentication provides a means to be certain of the originator of
  2042	      a message or other object in the same way that a Notary Public
  2043	      assures a signature on a legal document.  This is done by means of
  2044	      a "Public Key" cryptosystem.
  2045	
  2046	      A public key cryptosystem differs from a private key cryptosystem
  2047	      in several ways.  First, a public key system uses two keys, a
  2048	      Public Key that anyone can use (hence the name) and a Private Key
  2049	      that only the originator of a message uses.  The originator uses
  2050	      the private key to encrypt the message (as in DES).  The receiver,
  2051	      who has obtained the public key for the originator, may then
  2052	      decrypt the message.
  2053	
  2054	      In this scheme, the public key is used to authenticate the
  2055	      originator's use of his or her private key, and hence the identity
  2056	      of the originator is more rigorously proven.  The most widely
  2057	      known implementation of a public key cryptosystem is the RSA
  2058	      system [26].  The Internet standard for privacy enhanced mail
  2059	      makes use of the RSA system.
  2060	
  2061	   3.9.4  Information Integrity
  2062	
  2063	      Information integrity refers to the state of information such that
  2064	      it is complete, correct, and unchanged from the last time in which
  2065	
  2066

  2071	
  2072	
  2073	      it was verified to be in an "integral" state.  The value of
  2074	      information integrity to a site will vary.  For example, it is
  2075	      more important for military and government installations to
  2076	      prevent the "disclosure" of classified information, whether it is
  2077	      right or wrong.  A bank, on the other hand, is far more concerned
  2078	      with whether the account information maintained for its customers
  2079	      is complete and accurate.
  2080	
  2081	      Numerous computer system mechanisms, as well as procedural
  2082	      controls, have an influence on the integrity of system
  2083	      information.  Traditional access control mechanisms maintain
  2084	      controls over who can access system information.  These mechanisms
  2085	      alone are not sufficient in some cases to provide the degree of
  2086	      integrity required.  Some other mechanisms are briefly discussed
  2087	      below.
  2088	
  2089	      It should be noted that there are other aspects to maintaining
  2090	      system integrity besides these mechanisms, such as two-person
  2091	      controls, and integrity validation procedures.  These are beyond
  2092	      the scope of this document.
  2093	
  2094	      3.9.4.1  Checksums
  2095	
  2096	         Easily the simplest mechanism, a simple checksum routine can
  2097	         compute a value for a system file and compare it with the last
  2098	         known value.  If the two are equal, the file is probably
  2099	         unchanged.  If not, the file has been changed by some unknown
  2100	         means.
  2101	
  2102	         Though it is the easiest to implement, the checksum scheme
  2103	         suffers from a serious failing in that it is not very
  2104	         sophisticated and a determined attacker could easily add enough
  2105	         characters to the file to eventually obtain the correct value.
  2106	
  2107	         A specific type of checksum, called a CRC checksum, is
  2108	         considerably more robust than a simple checksum.  It is only
  2109	         slightly more difficult to implement and provides a better
  2110	         degree of catching errors.  It too, however, suffers from the
  2111	         possibility of compromise by an attacker.
  2112	
  2113	         Checksums may be used to detect the altering of information.
  2114	         However, they do not actively guard against changes being made.
  2115	         For this, other mechanisms such as access controls and
  2116	         encryption should be used.

  2128	
  2129	      3.9.4.2  Cryptographic Checksums
  2130	
  2131	         Cryptographic checksums (also called cryptosealing) involve
  2132	         breaking a file up into smaller chunks, calculating a (CRC)
  2133	         checksum for each chunk, and adding the CRCs together.
  2134	         Depending upon the exact algorithm used, this can result in a
  2135	         nearly unbreakable method of determining whether a file has
  2136	         been changed.  This mechanism suffers from the fact that it is
  2137	         sometimes computationally intensive and may be prohibitive
  2138	         except in cases where the utmost integrity protection is
  2139	         desired.
  2140	
  2141	         Another related mechanism, called a one-way hash function (or a
  2142	         Manipulation Detection Code (MDC)) can also be used to uniquely
  2143	         identify a file.  The idea behind these functions is that no
  2144	         two inputs can produce the same output, thus a modified file
  2145	         will not have the same hash value.  One-way hash functions can
  2146	         be implemented efficiently on a wide variety of systems, making
  2147	         unbreakable integrity checks possible.  (Snefru, a one-way hash
  2148	         function available via USENET as well as the Internet is just
  2149	         one example of an efficient one-way hash function.) [10]
  2150	
  2151	   3.9.5  Limiting Network Access
  2152	
  2153	      The dominant network protocols in use on the Internet, IP (RFC
  2154	      791) [11], TCP (RFC 793) [12], and UDP (RFC 768) [13], carry
  2155	      certain control information which can be used to restrict access
  2156	      to certain hosts or networks within an organization.
  2157	
  2158	      The IP packet header contains the network addresses of both the
  2159	      sender and recipient of the packet.  Further, the TCP and UDP
  2160	      protocols provide the notion of a "port", which identifies the
  2161	      endpoint (usually a network server) of a communications path.  In
  2162	      some instances, it may be desirable to deny access to a specific
  2163	      TCP or UDP port, or even to certain hosts and networks altogether.
  2164	
  2165	      3.9.5.1  Gateway Routing Tables
  2166	
  2167	         One of the simplest approaches to preventing unwanted network
  2168	         connections is to simply remove certain networks from a
  2169	         gateway's routing tables.  This makes it "impossible" for a
  2170	         host to send packets to these networks.  (Most protocols
  2171	         require bidirectional packet flow even for unidirectional data
  2172	         flow, thus breaking one side of the route is usually
  2173	         sufficient.)
  2174	
  2175	         This approach is commonly taken in "firewall" systems by
  2176	         preventing the firewall from advertising local routes to the
  2177	
  2178

  2183	
  2184	
  2185	         outside world.  The approach is deficient in that it often
  2186	         prevents "too much" (e.g., in order to prevent access to one
  2187	         system on the network, access to all systems on the network is
  2188	         disabled).
  2189	
  2190	      3.9.5.2  Router Packet Filtering
  2191	
  2192	         Many commercially available gateway systems (more correctly
  2193	         called routers) provide the ability to filter packets based not
  2194	         only on sources or destinations, but also on source-destination
  2195	         combinations.  This mechanism can be used to deny access to a
  2196	         specific host, network, or subnet from any other host, network,
  2197	         or subnet.
  2198	
  2199	         Gateway systems from some vendors (e.g., cisco Systems) support
  2200	         an even more complex scheme, allowing finer control over source
  2201	         and destination addresses.  Via the use of address masks, one
  2202	         can deny access to all but one host on a particular network.
  2203	         The cisco Systems also allow packet screening based on IP
  2204	         protocol type and TCP or UDP port numbers [14].
  2205	
  2206	         This can also be circumvented by "source routing" packets
  2207	         destined for the "secret" network.  Source routed packets may
  2208	         be filtered out by gateways, but this may restrict other
  2209	         legitimate activities, such as diagnosing routing problems.
  2210	
  2211	   3.9.6  Authentication Systems
  2212	
  2213	      Authentication refers to the process of proving a claimed identity
  2214	      to the satisfaction of some permission-granting authority.
  2215	      Authentication systems are hardware, software, or procedural
  2216	      mechanisms that enable a user to obtain access to computing
  2217	      resources.  At the simplest level, the system administrator who
  2218	      adds new user accounts to the system is part of the system
  2219	      authentication mechanism.  At the other end of the spectrum,
  2220	      fingerprint readers or retinal scanners provide a very high-tech
  2221	      solution to establishing a potential user's identity.  Without
  2222	      establishing and proving a user's identity prior to establishing a
  2223	      session, your site's computers are vulnerable to any sort of
  2224	      attack.
  2225	
  2226	      Typically, a user authenticates himself or herself to the system
  2227	      by entering a password in response to a prompt.
  2228	      Challenge/Response mechanisms improve upon passwords by prompting
  2229	      the user for some piece of information shared by both the computer
  2230	      and the user (such as mother's maiden name, etc.).

  2240	
  2241	      3.9.6.1  Kerberos
  2242	
  2243	         Kerberos, named after the dog who in mythology is said to stand
  2244	         at the gates of Hades, is a collection of software used in a
  2245	         large network to establish a user's claimed identity.
  2246	         Developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),
  2247	         it uses a combination of encryption and distributed databases
  2248	         so that a user at a campus facility can login and start a
  2249	         session from any computer located on the campus.  This has
  2250	         clear advantages in certain environments where there are a
  2251	         large number of potential users who may establish a connection
  2252	         from any one of a large number of workstations.  Some vendors
  2253	         are now incorporating Kerberos into their systems.
  2254	
  2255	         It should be noted that while Kerberos makes several advances
  2256	         in the area of authentication, some security weaknesses in the
  2257	         protocol still remain [15].
  2258	
  2259	      3.9.6.2  Smart Cards
  2260	
  2261	         Several systems use "smart cards" (a small calculator-like
  2262	         device) to help authenticate users.  These systems depend on
  2263	         the user having an object in their possession.  One such system
  2264	         involves a new password procedure that require a user to enter
  2265	         a value obtained from a "smart card" when asked for a password
  2266	         by the computer.  Typically, the host machine will give the
  2267	         user some piece of information that is entered into the
  2268	         keyboard of the smart card.  The smart card will display a
  2269	         response which must then be entered into the computer before
  2270	         the session will be established.  Another such system involves
  2271	         a smart card which displays a number which changes over time,
  2272	         but which is synchronized with the authentication software on
  2273	         the computer.
  2274	
  2275	         This is a better way of dealing with authentication than with
  2276	         the traditional password approach.  On the other hand, some say
  2277	         it's inconvenient to carry the smart card.  Start-up costs are
  2278	         likely to be high as well.
  2279	
  2280	   3.9.7  Books, Lists, and Informational Sources
  2281	
  2282	      There are many good sources for information regarding computer
  2283	      security.  The annotated bibliography at the end of this document
  2284	      can provide you with a good start.  In addition, information can
  2285	      be obtained from a variety of other sources, some of which are

  2375	
  2376	      3.9.7.3  Response Teams
  2377	
  2378	         Several organizations have formed special groups of people to
  2379	         deal with computer security problems.  These teams collect
  2380	         information about possible security holes and disseminate it to
  2381	         the proper people, track intruders, and assist in recovery from
  2382	         security violations.  The teams typically have both electronic
  2383	         mail distribution lists as well as a special telephone number
  2384	         which can be called for information or to report a problem.
  2385	         Many of these teams are members of the CERT System, which is
  2386	         coordinated by the National Institute of Standards and
  2387	         Technology (NIST), and exists to facilitate the exchange of
  2388	         information between the various teams.
  2389	
  2390	         3.9.7.3.1  DARPA Computer Emergency Response Team
  2391	
  2392	            The Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center
  2393	            (CERT/CC) was established in December 1988 by the Defense
  2394	            Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to address
  2395	            computer security concerns of research users of the
  2396	            Internet.  It is operated by the Software Engineering
  2397	            Institute (SEI) at Carnegie-Mellon University (CMU).  The
  2398	            CERT can immediately confer with experts to diagnose and
  2399	            solve security problems, and also establish and maintain
  2400	            communications with the affected computer users and

  2409	            government authorities as appropriate.
  2410	
  2411	            The CERT/CC serves as a clearing house for the
  2412	            identification and repair of security vulnerabilities,
  2413	            informal assessments of existing systems, improvement of
  2414	            emergency response capability, and both vendor and user
  2415	            security awareness.  In addition, the team works with
  2416	            vendors of various systems in order to coordinate the fixes
  2417	            for security problems.
  2418	
  2419	            The CERT/CC sends out security advisories to the CERT-
  2420	            ADVISORY mailing list whenever appropriate.  They also
  2421	            operate a 24-hour hotline that can be called to report
  2422	            security problems (e.g., someone breaking into your system),
  2423	            as well as to obtain current (and accurate) information
  2424	            about rumored security problems.
  2425	
  2426	            To join the CERT-ADVISORY mailing list, send a message to
  2427	            CERT@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU and ask to be added to the mailing
  2428	            list.  The material sent to this list also appears in the
  2429	            USENET newsgroup "comp.security.announce".  Past advisories
  2430	            are available for anonymous FTP from the host
  2431	            CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.  The 24-hour hotline number is (412) 268-
  2432	            7090.
  2433	
  2434	            The CERT/CC also maintains a CERT-TOOLS list to encourage
  2435	            the exchange of information on tools and techniques that
  2436	            increase the secure operation of Internet systems.  The
  2437	            CERT/CC does not review or endorse the tools described on
  2438	            the list.  To subscribe, send a message to CERT-TOOLS-
  2439	            REQUEST@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU and ask to be added to the mailing
  2440	            list.

  2528	
  2529	            CIAC is the Department of Energy's (DOE's) Computer Incident
  2530	            Advisory Capability.  CIAC is a four-person team of computer
  2531	            scientists from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
  2532	            (LLNL) charged with the primary responsibility of assisting
  2533	            DOE sites faced with computer security incidents (e.g.,
  2534	            intruder attacks, virus infections, worm attacks, etc.).
  2535	            This capability is available to DOE sites on a 24-hour-a-day
  2536	            basis.
  2537	
  2538	            CIAC was formed to provide a centralized response capability
  2539	            (including technical assistance), to keep sites informed of
  2540	            current events, to deal proactively with computer security
  2541	            issues, and to maintain liaisons with other response teams
  2542	            and agencies.  CIAC's charter is to assist sites (through
  2543	            direct technical assistance, providing information, or
  2544	            referring inquiries to other technical experts), serve as a
  2545	            clearinghouse for information about threats/known
  2546	            incidents/vulnerabilities, develop guidelines for incident
  2547	            handling, develop software for responding to
  2548	            events/incidents, analyze events and trends, conduct
  2549	            training and awareness activities, and alert and advise
  2550	            sites about vulnerabilities and potential attacks.

  2709	      3.9.8.1  Auditing
  2710	
  2711	         Auditing is an important tool that can be used to enhance the
  2712	         security of your installation.  Not only does it give you a
  2713	         means of identifying who has accessed your system (and may have
  2714	         done something to it) but it also gives you an indication of
  2715	         how your system is being used (or abused) by authorized users
  2716	         and attackers alike.  In addition, the audit trail
  2717	         traditionally kept by computer systems can become an invaluable
  2718	         piece of evidence should your system be penetrated.
  2719	
  2720	         3.9.8.1.1  Verify Security
  2721	
  2722	            An audit trail shows how the system is being used from day
  2723	            to day.  Depending upon how your site audit log is
  2724	            configured, your log files should show a range of access
  2725	            attempts that can show what normal system usage should look
  2726	            like.  Deviation from that normal usage could be the result
  2727	            of penetration from an outside source using an old or stale
  2728	            user account.  Observing a deviation in logins, for example,
  2729	            could be your first indication that something unusual is
  2730	            happening.

  2733	
  2734	            One of the ruses used by attackers to gain access to a
  2735	            system is by the insertion of a so-called Trojan Horse
  2736	            program.  A Trojan Horse program can be a program that does

  2744	
  2745	            something useful, or merely something interesting.  It
  2746	            always does something unexpected, like steal passwords or
  2747	            copy files without your knowledge [25].  Imagine a Trojan
  2748	            login program that prompts for username and password in the
  2749	            usual way, but also writes that information to a special
  2750	            file that the attacker can come back and read at will.
  2751	            Imagine a Trojan Editor program that, despite the file
  2752	            permissions you have given your files, makes copies of
  2753	            everything in your directory space without you knowing about
  2754	            it.
  2755	
  2756	            This points out the need for configuration management of the
  2757	            software that runs on a system, not as it is being
  2758	            developed, but as it is in actual operation.  Techniques for
  2759	            doing this range from checking each command every time it is
  2760	            executed against some criterion (such as a cryptoseal,
  2761	            described above) or merely checking the date and time stamp
  2762	            of the executable.  Another technique might be to check each
  2763	            command in batch mode at midnight.
  2764	
  2765	      3.9.8.2  Tools
  2766	
  2767	         COPS is a security tool for system administrators that checks
  2768	         for numerous common security problems on UNIX systems [27].
  2769	         COPS is a collection of shell scripts and C programs that can
  2770	         easily be run on almost any UNIX variant.  Among other things,
  2771	         it checks the following items and sends the results to the
  2772	         system administrator:
  2773	
  2774	            - Checks "/dev/kmem" and other devices for world
  2775	              read/writability.
  2776	
  2777	            - Checks special or important files and directories for
  2778	              "bad" modes (world writable, etc.).
  2779	
  2780	            - Checks for easily-guessed passwords.
  2781	
  2782	            - Checks for duplicate user ids, invalid fields in the
  2783	              password file, etc..
  2784	
  2785	            - Checks for duplicate group ids, invalid fields in the
  2786	              group file, etc..
  2787	
  2788	            - Checks all users' home directories and their ".cshrc",
  2789	              ".login", ".profile", and ".rhosts" files for security
  2790	              problems.
  2791	
  2792	            - Checks all commands in the "/etc/rc" files and "cron"

  2801	              files for world writability.
  2802	
  2803	            - Checks for bad "root" paths, NFS file systems exported
  2804	              to the world, etc..
  2805	
  2806	            - Includes an expert system that checks to see if a given
  2807	              user (usually "root") can be compromised, given that
  2808	              certain rules are true.
  2809	
  2810	            - Checks for changes in the setuid status of programs on the
  2811	              system.

  2813	         The COPS package is available from the "comp.sources.unix"

  2929	      3.9.9.2  Obtaining Fixes for Known Problems
  2930	
  2931	         It goes without saying that computer systems have bugs.  Even
  2932	         operating systems, upon which we depend for protection of our
  2933	         data, have bugs.  And since there are bugs, things can be
  2934	         broken, both maliciously and accidentally.  It is important
  2935	         that whenever bugs are discovered, a should fix be identified
  2936	         and implemented as soon as possible.  This should minimize any
  2937	         exposure caused by the bug in the first place.
  2938	
  2939	         A corollary to the bug problem is: from whom do I obtain the
  2940	         fixes?  Most systems have some support from the manufacturer or
  2941	         supplier.  Fixes coming from that source tend to be implemented
  2942	         quickly after receipt.  Fixes for some problems are often
  2943	         posted on the network and are left to the system administrators
  2944	         to incorporate as they can.  The problem is that one wants to
  2945	         have faith that the fix will close the hole and not introduce
  2946	         any others.  We will tend to trust that the manufacturer's
  2947	         fixes are better than those that are posted on the net.
  2948	
  2949	      3.9.9.3  Sun Customer Warning System
  2950	
  2951	         Sun Microsystems has established a Customer Warning System
  2952	         (CWS) for handling security incidents.  This is a formal
  2953	         process which includes:
  2954	
  2955	            - Having a well advertised point of contact in Sun
  2956	              for reporting security problems.
  2957	            - Pro-actively alerting customers of worms, viruses,
  2958	              or other security holes that could affect their systems.
  2959	            - Distributing the patch (or work-around) as quickly
  2960	              as possible.

  2967	
  2968	
  2969	         They have created an electronic mail address, SECURITY-
  2970	         ALERT@SUN.COM, which will enable customers to report security
  2971	         problems.  A voice-mail backup is available at (415) 688-9081.
  2972	         A "Security Contact" can be designated by each customer site;
  2973	         this person will be contacted by Sun in case of any new
  2974	         security problems.  For more information, contact your Sun
  2975	         representative.
  2976	
  2977	      3.9.9.4  Trusted Archive Servers
  2978	
  2979	         Several sites on the Internet maintain large repositories of
  2980	         public-domain and freely distributable software, and make this
  2981	         material available for anonymous FTP.  This section describes
  2982	         some of the larger repositories.  Note that none of these
  2983	         servers implements secure checksums or anything else
  2984	         guaranteeing the integrity of their data.  Thus, the notion of
  2985	         "trust" should be taken as a somewhat limited definition.
  2986	
  2987	         3.9.9.4.1  Sun Fixes on UUNET
  2988	
  2989	            Sun Microsystems has contracted with UUNET Communications
  2990	            Services, Inc., to make fixes for bugs in Sun software
  2991	            available via anonymous FTP.  You can access these fixes by
  2992	            using the "ftp" command to connect to the host FTP.UU.NET.
  2993	            Then change into the directory "sun-dist/security", and
  2994	            obtain a directory listing.  The file "README" contains a
  2995	            brief description of what each file in this directory
  2996	            contains, and what is required to install the fix.
  2997	
  2998	         3.9.9.4.2  Berkeley Fixes
  2999	
  3000	            The University of California at Berkeley also makes fixes
  3001	            available via anonymous FTP; these fixes pertain primarily
  3002	            to the current release of BSD UNIX (currently, release 4.3).
  3003	            However, even if you are not running their software, these
  3004	            fixes are still important, since many vendors (Sun, DEC,
  3005	            Sequent, etc.) base their software on the Berkeley releases.
  3006	
  3007	            The Berkeley fixes are available for anonymous FTP from the
  3008	            host UCBARPA.BERKELEY.EDU in the directory "4.3/ucb-fixes".
  3009	            The file "INDEX" in this directory describes what each file
  3010	            contains.  They are also available from UUNET (see section
  3011	            3.9.9.4.3).
  3012	
  3013	            Berkeley also distributes new versions of "sendmail" and
  3014	            "named" from this machine.  New versions of these commands
  3015	            are stored in the "4.3" directory, usually in the files
  3016	            "sendmail.tar.Z" and "bind.tar.Z", respectively.

  3025	         3.9.9.4.3  Simtel-20 and UUNET
  3026	
  3027	            The two largest general-purpose software repositories on the
  3028	            Internet are the hosts WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL and
  3029	            FTP.UU.NET.
  3030	
  3031	            WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL is a TOPS-20 machine operated by the
  3032	            U.S. Army at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico.
  3033	            The directory "pd2:<unix-c>" contains a large amount of UNIX
  3034	            software, primarily taken from the "comp.sources"
  3035	            newsgroups.  The directories "pd1:<msdos>" and
  3036	            "pd2:<msdos2>" contains software for IBM PC systems, and
  3037	            "pd3:<macintosh>" contains software for the Apple Macintosh.
  3038	
  3039	            FTP.UU.NET is operated by UUNET Communications Services,
  3040	            Inc. in Falls Church, Virginia.  This company sells Internet
  3041	            and USENET access to sites all over the country (and
  3042	            internationally).  The software posted to the following
  3043	            USENET source newsgroups is stored here, in directories of
  3044	            the same name:
  3045	
  3046	               comp.sources.games
  3047	               comp.sources.misc
  3048	               comp.sources.sun
  3049	               comp.sources.unix
  3050	               comp.sources.x
  3051	
  3052	            Numerous other distributions, such as all the freely
  3053	            distributable Berkeley UNIX source code, Internet Request
  3054	            for Comments (RFCs), and so on are also stored on this
  3055	            system.

  3057	         3.9.9.4.4  Vendors
  3058	
  3059	            Many vendors make fixes for bugs in their software available
  3060	            electronically, either via mailing lists or via anonymous
  3061	            FTP.  You should contact your vendor to find out if they
  3062	            offer this service, and if so, how to access it.  Some
  3063	            vendors that offer these services include Sun Microsystems
  3064	            (see above), Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), the
  3065	            University of California at Berkeley (see above), and Apple
  3066	            Computer [5, CURRY].

  3081	4.  Types of Security Procedures
  3082	
  3083	4.1  System Security Audits
  3084	
  3085	   Most businesses undergo some sort of annual financial auditing as a
  3086	   regular part of their business life.  Security audits are an
  3087	   important part of running any computing environment.  Part of the
  3088	   security audit should be a review of any policies that concern system
  3089	   security, as well as the mechanisms that are put in place to enforce
  3090	   them.
  3091	
  3092	   4.1.1   Organize Scheduled Drills
  3093	
  3094	      Although not something that would be done each day or week,
  3095	      scheduled drills may be conducted to determine if the procedures
  3096	      defined are adequate for the threat to be countered.  If your
  3097	      major threat is one of natural disaster, then a drill would be
  3098	      conducted to verify your backup and recovery mechanisms.  On the
  3099	      other hand, if your greatest threat is from external intruders
  3100	      attempting to penetrate your system, a drill might be conducted to
  3101	      actually try a penetration to observe the effect of the policies.
  3102	
  3103	      Drills are a valuable way to test that your policies and
  3104	      procedures are effective.  On the other hand, drills can be time-
  3105	      consuming and disruptive to normal operations.  It is important to
  3106	      weigh the benefits of the drills against the possible time loss
  3107	      which may be associated with them.
  3108	
  3109	   4.1.2  Test Procedures
  3110	
  3111	      If the choice is made to not to use scheduled drills to examine
  3112	      your entire security procedure at one time, it is important to
  3113	      test individual procedures frequently.  Examine your backup
  3114	      procedure to make sure you can recover data from the tapes.  Check
  3115	      log files to be sure that information which is supposed to be
  3116	      logged to them is being logged to them, etc..
  3117	
  3118	      When a security audit is mandated, great care should be used in
  3119	      devising tests of the security policy.  It is important to clearly
  3120	      identify what is being tested, how the test will be conducted, and
  3121	      results expected from the test.  This should all be documented and
  3122	      included in or as an adjunct to the security policy document
  3123	      itself.
  3124	
  3125	      It is important to test all aspects of the security policy, both
  3126	      procedural and automated, with a particular emphasis on the
  3127	      automated mechanisms used to enforce the policy.  Tests should be
  3128	      defined to ensure a comprehensive examination of policy features,
  3129	
  3130	
  3131

  3135	
  3136	
  3137	      that is, if a test is defined to examine the user logon process,
  3138	      it should be explicitly stated that both valid and invalid user
  3139	      names and passwords will be used to demonstrate proper operation
  3140	      of the logon program.
  3141	
  3142	      Keep in mind that there is a limit to the reasonableness of tests.
  3143	      The purpose of testing is to ensure confidence that the security
  3144	      policy is being correctly enforced, and not to "prove" the
  3145	      absoluteness of the system or policy.  The goal should be to
  3146	      obtain some assurance that the reasonable and credible controls
  3147	      imposed by your security policy are adequate.
  3148	
  3149	4.2  Account Management Procedures
  3150	
  3151	   Procedures to manage accounts are important in preventing
  3152	   unauthorized access to your system.  It is necessary to decide
  3153	   several things: Who may have an account on the system?  How long may
  3154	   someone have an account without renewing his or her request?  How do
  3155	   old accounts get removed from the system?  The answers to all these
  3156	   questions should be explicitly set out in the policy.
  3157	
  3158	   In addition to deciding who may use a system, it may be important to
  3159	   determine what each user may use the system for (is personal use
  3160	   allowed, for example).  If you are connected to an outside network,
  3161	   your site or the network management may have rules about what the
  3162	   network may be used for.  Therefore, it is important for any security
  3163	   policy to define an adequate account management procedure for both
  3164	   administrators and users.  Typically, the system administrator would
  3165	   be responsible for creating and deleting user accounts and generally
  3166	   maintaining overall control of system use.  To some degree, account
  3167	   management is also the responsibility of each system user in the
  3168	   sense that the user should observe any system messages and events
  3169	   that may be indicative of a policy violation.  For example, a message
  3170	   at logon that indicates the date and time of the last logon should be
  3171	   reported by the user if it indicates an unreasonable time of last
  3172	   logon.
  3173	
  3174	4.3  Password Management Procedures
  3175	
  3176	   A policy on password management may be important if your site wishes
  3177	   to enforce secure passwords.  These procedures may range from asking
  3178	   or forcing users to change their passwords occasionally to actively
  3179	   attempting to break users' passwords and then informing the user of
  3180	   how easy it was to do.  Another part of password management policy
  3181	   covers who may distribute passwords - can users give their passwords
  3182	   to other users?
  3183	
  3184	   Section 2.3 discusses some of the policy issues that need to be
  3185	
  3186

  3191	
  3192	
  3193	   decided for proper password management.  Regardless of the policies,
  3194	   password management procedures need to be carefully setup to avoid
  3195	   disclosing passwords.  The choice of initial passwords for accounts
  3196	   is critical.  In some cases, users may never login to activate an
  3197	   account; thus, the choice of the initial password should not be
  3198	   easily guessed.  Default passwords should never be assigned to
  3199	   accounts: always create new passwords for each user.  If there are
  3200	   any printed lists of passwords, these should be kept off-line in
  3201	   secure locations; better yet, don't list passwords.
  3202	
  3203	   4.3.1  Password Selection
  3204	
  3205	      Perhaps the most vulnerable part of any computer system is the
  3206	      account password.  Any computer system, no matter how secure it is
  3207	      from network or dial-up attack, Trojan horse programs, and so on,
  3208	      can be fully exploited by an intruder if he or she can gain access
  3209	      via a poorly chosen password.  It is important to define a good
  3210	      set of rules for password selection, and distribute these rules to
  3211	      all users.  If possible, the software which sets user passwords
  3212	      should be modified to enforce as many of the rules as possible.
  3213	
  3214	      A sample set of guidelines for password selection is shown below:
  3215	
  3216	         - DON'T use your login name in any form (as-is,
  3217	           reversed, capitalized, doubled, etc.).
  3218	
  3219	         - DON'T use your first, middle, or last name in any form.
  3220	
  3221	         - DON'T use your spouse's or child's name.
  3222	
  3223	         - DON'T use other information easily obtained about you.
  3224	           This includes license plate numbers, telephone numbers,
  3225	           social security numbers, the make of your automobile,
  3226	           the name of the street you live on, etc..
  3227	
  3228	         - DON'T use a password of all digits, or all the same
  3229	           letter.
  3230	
  3231	         - DON'T use a word contained in English or foreign
  3232	           language dictionaries, spelling lists, or other
  3233	           lists of words.
  3234	
  3235	         - DON'T use a password shorter than six characters.
  3236	
  3237	         - DO use a password with mixed-case alphabetics.
  3238	
  3239	         - DO use a password with non-alphabetic characters (digits
  3240	           or punctuation).
  3241

  3247	
  3248	
  3249	         - DO use a password that is easy to remember, so you don't
  3250	           have to write it down.
  3251	
  3252	         - DO use a password that you can type quickly, without
  3253	           having to look at the keyboard.
  3254	
  3255	      Methods of selecting a password which adheres to these guidelines
  3256	      include:
  3257	
  3258	         - Choose a line or two from a song or poem, and use the
  3259	           first letter of each word.
  3260	
  3261	         - Alternate between one consonant and one or two vowels, up
  3262	           to seven or eight characters.  This provides nonsense
  3263	           words which are usually pronounceable, and thus easily
  3264	           remembered.
  3265	
  3266	         - Choose two short words and concatenate them together with
  3267	           a punctuation character between them.
  3268	
  3269	      Users should also be told to change their password periodically,
  3270	      usually every three to six months.  This makes sure that an
  3271	      intruder who has guessed a password will eventually lose access,
  3272	      as well as invalidating any list of passwords he/she may have
  3273	      obtained.  Many systems enable the system administrator to force
  3274	      users to change their passwords after an expiration period; this
  3275	      software should be enabled if your system supports it [5, CURRY].
  3276	
  3277	      Some systems provide software which forces users to change their
  3278	      passwords on a regular basis.  Many of these systems also include
  3279	      password generators which provide the user with a set of passwords
  3280	      to choose from.  The user is not permitted to make up his or her
  3281	      own password.  There are arguments both for and against systems
  3282	      such as these.  On the one hand, by using generated passwords,
  3283	      users are prevented from selecting insecure passwords.  On the
  3284	      other hand, unless the generator is good at making up easy to
  3285	      remember passwords, users will begin writing them down in order to
  3286	      remember them.
  3287	
  3288	   4.3.2  Procedures for Changing Passwords
  3289	
  3290	      How password changes are handled is important to keeping passwords
  3291	      secure.  Ideally, users should be able to change their own
  3292	      passwords on-line.  (Note that password changing programs are a
  3293	      favorite target of intruders.  See section 4.4 on configuration
  3294	      management for further information.)
  3295	
  3296	      However, there are exception cases which must be handled
  3297	
  3298

  3303	
  3304	
  3305	      carefully.  Users may forget passwords and not be able to get onto
  3306	      the system.  The standard procedure is to assign the user a new
  3307	      password.  Care should be taken to make sure that the real person
  3308	      is requesting the change and gets the new password.  One common
  3309	      trick used by intruders is to call or message to a system
  3310	      administrator and request a new password. Some external form of
  3311	      verification should be used before the password is assigned.  At
  3312	      some sites, users are required to show up in person with ID.
  3313	
  3314	      There may also be times when many passwords need to be changed.
  3315	      If a system is compromised by an intruder, the intruder may be
  3316	      able to steal a password file and take it off the system.  Under
  3317	      these circumstances, one course of action is to change all
  3318	      passwords on the system.  Your site should have procedures for how
  3319	      this can be done quickly and efficiently.  What course you choose
  3320	      may depend on the urgency of the problem.  In the case of a known
  3321	      attack with damage, you may choose to forcibly disable all
  3322	      accounts and assign users new passwords before they come back onto
  3323	      the system.  In some places, users are sent a message telling them
  3324	      that they should change their passwords, perhaps within a certain
  3325	      time period.  If the password isn't changed before the time period
  3326	      expires, the account is locked.
  3327	
  3328	      Users should be aware of what the standard procedure is for
  3329	      passwords when a security event has occurred.  One well-known
  3330	      spoof reported by the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)
  3331	      involved messages sent to users, supposedly from local system
  3332	      administrators, requesting them to immediately change their
  3333	      password to a new value provided in the message [24].  These
  3334	      messages were not from the administrators, but from intruders
  3335	      trying to steal accounts.  Users should be warned to immediately
  3336	      report any suspicious requests such as this to site
  3337	      administrators.
  3338	
  3339	4.4  Configuration Management Procedures
  3340	
  3341	   Configuration management is generally applied to the software
  3342	   development process.  However, it is certainly applicable in a
  3343	   operational sense as well.  Consider that the since many of the
  3344	   system level programs are intended to enforce the security policy, it
  3345	   is important that these be "known" as correct.  That is, one should
  3346	   not allow system level programs (such as the operating system, etc.)
  3347	   to be changed arbitrarily.  At very least, the procedures should
  3348	   state who is authorized to make changes to systems, under what
  3349	   circumstances, and how the changes should be documented.
  3350	
  3351	   In some environments, configuration management is also desirable as
  3352	   applied to physical configuration of equipment.  Maintaining valid
  3353

  3359	
  3360	
  3361	   and authorized hardware configuration should be given due
  3362	   consideration in your security policy.
  3363	
  3364	   4.4.1  Non-Standard Configurations
  3365	
  3366	      Occasionally, it may be beneficial to have a slightly non-standard
  3367	      configuration in order to thwart the "standard" attacks used by
  3368	      some intruders.  The non-standard parts of the configuration might
  3369	      include different password encryption algorithms, different
  3370	      configuration file locations, and rewritten or functionally
  3371	      limited system commands.
  3372	
  3373	      Non-standard configurations, however, also have their drawbacks.
  3374	      By changing the "standard" system, these modifications make
  3375	      software maintenance more difficult by requiring extra
  3376	      documentation to be written, software modification after operating
  3377	      system upgrades, and, usually, someone with special knowledge of
  3378	      the changes.
  3379	
  3380	      Because of the drawbacks of non-standard configurations, they are
  3381	      often only used in environments with a "firewall" machine (see
  3382	      section 3.9.1).  The firewall machine is modified in non-standard
  3383	      ways since it is susceptible to attack, while internal systems
  3384	      behind the firewall are left in their standard configurations.
  3385	
  3386	5.  Incident Handling
  3387	
  3388	5.1  Overview
  3389	
  3390	   This section of the document will supply some guidance to be applied
  3391	   when a computer security event is in progress on a machine, network,
  3392	   site, or multi-site environment.  The operative philosophy in the
  3393	   event of a breach of computer security, whether it be an external
  3394	   intruder attack or a disgruntled employee, is to plan for adverse
  3395	   events in advance.  There is no substitute for creating contingency
  3396	   plans for the types of events described above.
  3397	
  3398	   Traditional computer security, while quite important in the overall
  3399	   site security plan, usually falls heavily on protecting systems from
  3400	   attack, and perhaps monitoring systems to detect attacks.  Little
  3401	   attention is usually paid for how to actually handle the attack when
  3402	   it occurs.  The result is that when an attack is in progress, many
  3403	   decisions are made in haste and can be damaging to tracking down the
  3404	   source of the incident, collecting evidence to be used in prosecution
  3405	   efforts, preparing for the recovery of the system, and protecting the
  3406	   valuable data contained on the system.

  3415	
  3416	
  3417	   5.1.1  Have a Plan to Follow in Case of an Incident
  3418	
  3419	      Part of handling an incident is being prepared to respond before
  3420	      the incident occurs.  This includes establishing a suitable level
  3421	      of protections, so that if the incident becomes severe, the damage
  3422	      which can occur is limited.  Protection includes preparing
  3423	      incident handling guidelines or a contingency response plan for
  3424	      your organization or site.  Having written plans eliminates much
  3425	      of the ambiguity which occurs during an incident, and will lead to
  3426	      a more appropriate and thorough set of responses.  Second, part of
  3427	      protection is preparing a method of notification, so you will know
  3428	      who to call and the relevant phone numbers.  It is important, for
  3429	      example, to conduct "dry runs," in which your computer security
  3430	      personnel, system administrators, and managers simulate handling
  3431	      an incident.
  3432	
  3433	      Learning to respond efficiently to an incident is important for
  3434	      numerous reasons.  The most important benefit is directly to human
  3435	      beings--preventing loss of human life.  Some computing systems are
  3436	      life critical systems, systems on which human life depends (e.g.,
  3437	      by controlling some aspect of life-support in a hospital or
  3438	      assisting air traffic controllers).
  3439	
  3440	      An important but often overlooked benefit is an economic one.
  3441	      Having both technical and managerial personnel respond to an
  3442	      incident requires considerable resources, resources which could be
  3443	      utilized more profitably if an incident did not require their
  3444	      services.  If these personnel are trained to handle an incident
  3445	      efficiently, less of their time is required to deal with that
  3446	      incident.
  3447	
  3448	      A third benefit is protecting classified, sensitive, or
  3449	      proprietary information.  One of the major dangers of a computer
  3450	      security incident is that information may be irrecoverable.
  3451	      Efficient incident handling minimizes this danger.  When
  3452	      classified information is involved, other government regulations
  3453	      may apply and must be integrated into any plan for incident
  3454	      handling.
  3455	
  3456	      A fourth benefit is related to public relations.  News about
  3457	      computer security incidents tends to be damaging to an
  3458	      organization's stature among current or potential clients.
  3459	      Efficient incident handling minimizes the potential for negative
  3460	      exposure.
  3461	
  3462	      A final benefit of efficient incident handling is related to legal
  3463	      issues.  It is possible that in the near future organizations may
  3464	      be sued because one of their nodes was used to launch a network
  3465	
  3466

  3472	
  3473	      attack.  In a similar vein, people who develop patches or
  3474	      workarounds may be sued if the patches or workarounds are
  3475	      ineffective, resulting in damage to systems, or if the patches or
  3476	      workarounds themselves damage systems.  Knowing about operating
  3477	      system vulnerabilities and patterns of attacks and then taking
  3478	      appropriate measures is critical to circumventing possible legal
  3479	      problems.
  3480	
  3481	   5.1.2  Order of Discussion in this Session Suggests an Order for
  3482	          a Plan
  3483	
  3484	      This chapter is arranged such that a list may be generated from
  3485	      the Table of Contents to provide a starting point for creating a
  3486	      policy for handling ongoing incidents.  The main points to be
  3487	      included in a policy for handling incidents are:
  3488	
  3489	         o Overview (what are the goals and objectives in handling the
  3490	           incident).
  3491	         o Evaluation (how serious is the incident).
  3492	         o Notification (who should be notified about the incident).
  3493	         o Response (what should the response to the incident be).
  3494	         o Legal/Investigative (what are the legal and prosecutorial
  3495	           implications of the incident).
  3496	         o Documentation Logs (what records should be kept from before,
  3497	           during, and after the incident).
  3498	
  3499	      Each of these points is important in an overall plan for handling
  3500	      incidents.  The remainder of this chapter will detail the issues
  3501	      involved in each of these topics, and provide some guidance as to
  3502	      what should be included in a site policy for handling incidents.
  3503	
  3504	      5.1.3  Possible Goals and Incentives for Efficient Incident
  3505	             Handling
  3506	
  3507	      As in any set of pre-planned procedures, attention must be placed
  3508	      on a set of goals to be obtained in handling an incident.  These
  3509	      goals will be placed in order of importance depending on the site,
  3510	      but one such set of goals might be:
  3511	
  3512	         Assure integrity of (life) critical systems.
  3513	         Maintain and restore data.
  3514	         Maintain and restore service.
  3515	         Figure out how it happened.
  3516	         Avoid escalation and further incidents.
  3517	         Avoid negative publicity.
  3518	         Find out who did it.
  3519	         Punish the attackers.

  3527	
  3528	
  3529	      It is important to prioritize actions to be taken during an
  3530	      incident well in advance of the time an incident occurs.
  3531	      Sometimes an incident may be so complex that it is impossible to
  3532	      do everything at once to respond to it; priorities are essential.
  3533	      Although priorities will vary from institution-to-institution, the
  3534	      following suggested priorities serve as a starting point for
  3535	      defining an organization's response:
  3536	
  3537	         o Priority one -- protect human life and people's
  3538	           safety; human life always has precedence over all
  3539	           other considerations.
  3540	
  3541	         o Priority two -- protect classified and/or sensitive
  3542	           data (as regulated by your site or by government
  3543	           regulations).
  3544	
  3545	         o Priority three -- protect other data, including
  3546	           proprietary, scientific, managerial and other data,
  3547	           because loss of data is costly in terms of resources.
  3548	
  3549	         o Priority four -- prevent damage to systems (e.g., loss
  3550	           or alteration of system files, damage to disk drives,
  3551	           etc.); damage to systems can result in costly down
  3552	           time and recovery.
  3553	
  3554	         o Priority five -- minimize disruption of computing
  3555	           resources; it is better in many cases to shut a system
  3556	           down or disconnect from a network than to risk damage
  3557	           to data or systems.
  3558	
  3559	      An important implication for defining priorities is that once
  3560	      human life and national security considerations have been
  3561	      addressed, it is generally more important to save data than system
  3562	      software and hardware.  Although it is undesirable to have any
  3563	      damage or loss during an incident, systems can be replaced; the
  3564	      loss or compromise of data (especially classified data), however,
  3565	      is usually not an acceptable outcome under any circumstances.
  3566	
  3567	      Part of handling an incident is being prepared to respond before
  3568	      the incident occurs.  This includes establishing a suitable level
  3569	      of protections so that if the incident becomes severe, the damage
  3570	      which can occur is limited.  Protection includes preparing
  3571	      incident handling guidelines or a contingency response plan for
  3572	      your organization or site.  Written plans eliminate much of the
  3573	      ambiguity which occurs during an incident, and will lead to a more
  3574	      appropriate and thorough set of responses.  Second, part of
  3575	      protection is preparing a method of notification so you will know
  3576	      who to call and how to contact them.  For example, every member of
  3577	
  3578	
  3579	
  3580	Site Security Policy Handbook Working Group                    [Page 64]

  3583	
  3584	
  3585	      the Department of Energy's CIAC Team carries a card with every
  3586	      other team member's work and home phone numbers, as well as pager
  3587	      numbers.  Third, your organization or site should establish backup
  3588	      procedures for every machine and system.  Having backups
  3589	      eliminates much of the threat of even a severe incident, since
  3590	      backups preclude serious data loss.  Fourth, you should set up
  3591	      secure systems.  This involves eliminating vulnerabilities,
  3592	      establishing an effective password policy, and other procedures,
  3593	      all of which will be explained later in this document.  Finally,
  3594	      conducting training activities is part of protection.  It is
  3595	      important, for example, to conduct "dry runs," in which your
  3596	      computer security personnel, system administrators, and managers
  3597	      simulate handling an incident.
  3598	
  3599	   5.1.4  Local Policies and Regulations Providing Guidance
  3600	
  3601	      Any plan for responding to security incidents should be guided by
  3602	      local policies and regulations.  Government and private sites that
  3603	      deal with classified material have specific rules that they must
  3604	      follow.
  3605	
  3606	      The policies your site makes about how it responds to incidents
  3607	      (as discussed in sections 2.4 and 2.5) will shape your response.
  3608	      For example, it may make little sense to create mechanisms to
  3609	      monitor and trace intruders if your site does not plan to take
  3610	      action against the intruders if they are caught.  Other
  3611	      organizations may have policies that affect your plans.  Telephone
  3612	      companies often release information about telephone traces only to
  3613	      law enforcement agencies.
  3614	
  3615	      Section 5.5 also notes that if any legal action is planned, there
  3616	      are specific guidelines that must be followed to make sure that
  3617	      any information collected can be used as evidence.
  3618	
  3619	5.2  Evaluation
  3620	
  3621	   5.2.1  Is It Real?
  3622	
  3623	      This stage involves determining the exact problem.  Of course
  3624	      many, if not most, signs often associated with virus infections,
  3625	      system intrusions, etc., are simply anomalies such as hardware
  3626	      failures.  To assist in identifying whether there really is an
  3627	      incident, it is usually helpful to obtain and use any detection
  3628	      software which may be available.  For example, widely available
  3629	      software packages can greatly assist someone who thinks there may
  3630	      be a virus in a Macintosh computer.  Audit information is also
  3631	      extremely useful, especially in determining whether there is a
  3632	      network attack.  It is extremely important to obtain a system

  3641	      snapshot as soon as one suspects that something is wrong.  Many
  3642	      incidents cause a dynamic chain of events to occur, and an initial
  3643	      system snapshot may do more good in identifying the problem and
  3644	      any source of attack than most other actions which can be taken at
  3645	      this stage.  Finally, it is important to start a log book.
  3646	      Recording system events, telephone conversations, time stamps,
  3647	      etc., can lead to a more rapid and systematic identification of
  3648	      the problem, and is the basis for subsequent stages of incident
  3649	      handling.
  3650	
  3651	      There are certain indications or "symptoms" of an incident which
  3652	      deserve special attention:
  3653	
  3654	         o System crashes.
  3655	         o New user accounts (e.g., the account RUMPLESTILTSKIN
  3656	           has unexplainedly been created), or high activity on
  3657	           an account that has had virtually no activity for
  3658	           months.
  3659	         o New files (usually with novel or strange file names,
  3660	           such as data.xx or k).
  3661	         o Accounting discrepancies (e.g., in a UNIX system you
  3662	           might notice that the accounting file called
  3663	           /usr/admin/lastlog has shrunk, something that should
  3664	           make you very suspicious that there may be an
  3665	           intruder).
  3666	         o Changes in file lengths or dates (e.g., a user should
  3667	           be suspicious if he/she observes that the .EXE files in
  3668	           an MS DOS computer have unexplainedly grown
  3669	           by over 1800 bytes).
  3670	         o Attempts to write to system (e.g., a system manager
  3671	           notices that a privileged user in a VMS system is
  3672	           attempting to alter RIGHTSLIST.DAT).
  3673	         o Data modification or deletion (e.g., files start to
  3674	           disappear).
  3675	         o Denial of service (e.g., a system manager and all
  3676	           other users become locked out of a UNIX system, which
  3677	           has been changed to single user mode).
  3678	         o Unexplained, poor system performance (e.g., system
  3679	           response time becomes unusually slow).
  3680	         o Anomalies (e.g., "GOTCHA" is displayed on a display
  3681	           terminal or there are frequent unexplained "beeps").
  3682	         o Suspicious probes (e.g., there are numerous
  3683	           unsuccessful login attempts from another node).
  3684	         o Suspicious browsing (e.g., someone becomes a root user
  3685	           on a UNIX system and accesses file after file in one
  3686	           user's account, then another's).
  3687	
  3688	      None of these indications is absolute "proof" that an incident is
  3689

  3694	RFC 1244                 Site Security Handbook                July 1991
  3695	
  3696	
  3697	      occurring, nor are all of these indications normally observed when
  3698	      an incident occurs.  If you observe any of these indications,
  3699	      however, it is important to suspect that an incident might be
  3700	      occurring, and act accordingly.  There is no formula for
  3701	      determining with 100 percent accuracy that an incident is
  3702	      occurring (possible exception: when a virus detection package
  3703	      indicates that your machine has the nVIR virus and you confirm
  3704	      this by examining contents of the nVIR resource in your Macintosh
  3705	      computer, you can be very certain that your machine is infected).
  3706	      It is best at this point to collaborate with other technical and
  3707	      computer security personnel to make a decision as a group about
  3708	      whether an incident is occurring.
  3709	
  3710	   5.2.2  Scope
  3711	
  3712	      Along with the identification of the incident is the evaluation of
  3713	      the scope and impact of the problem.  It is important to correctly
  3714	      identify the boundaries of the incident in order to effectively
  3715	      deal with it.  In addition, the impact of an incident will
  3716	      determine its priority in allocating resources to deal with the
  3717	      event.  Without an indication of the scope and impact of the
  3718	      event, it is difficult to determine a correct response.
  3719	
  3720	      In order to identify the scope and impact, a set of criteria
  3721	      should be defined which is appropriate to the site and to the type
  3722	      of connections available.  Some of the issues are:
  3723	
  3724	         o Is this a multi-site incident?
  3725	         o Are many computers at your site effected by this
  3726	           incident?
  3727	         o Is sensitive information involved?
  3728	         o What is the entry point of the incident (network,
  3729	           phone line, local terminal, etc.)?
  3730	         o Is the press involved?
  3731	         o What is the potential damage of the incident?
  3732	         o What is the estimated time to close out the incident?
  3733	         o What resources could be required
  3734	           to handle the incident?
  3735	
  3736	5.3  Possible Types of Notification
  3737	
  3738	   When you have confirmed that an incident is occurring, the
  3739	   appropriate personnel must be notified.  Who and how this
  3740	   notification is achieved is very important in keeping the event under
  3741	   control both from a technical and emotional standpoint.

  3751	
  3752	
  3753	   5.3.1  Explicit
  3754	
  3755	      First of all, any notification to either local or off-site
  3756	      personnel must be explicit.  This requires that any statement (be
  3757	      it an electronic mail message, phone call, or fax) provides
  3758	      information about the incident that is clear, concise, and fully
  3759	      qualified.  When you are notifying others that will help you to
  3760	      handle an event, a "smoke screen" will only divide the effort and
  3761	      create confusion.  If a division of labor is suggested, it is
  3762	      helpful to provide information to each section about what is being
  3763	      accomplished in other efforts.  This will not only reduce
  3764	      duplication of effort, but allow people working on parts of the
  3765	      problem to know where to obtain other information that would help
  3766	      them resolve a part of the incident.
  3767	
  3768	   5.3.2  Factual
  3769	
  3770	      Another important consideration when communicating about the
  3771	      incident is to be factual.  Attempting to hide aspects of the
  3772	      incident by providing false or incomplete information may not only
  3773	      prevent a successful resolution to the incident, but may even
  3774	      worsen the situation.  This is especially true when the press is
  3775	      involved.  When an incident severe enough to gain press attention
  3776	      is ongoing, it is likely that any false information you provide
  3777	      will not be substantiated by other sources.  This will reflect
  3778	      badly on the site and may create enough ill-will between the site
  3779	      and the press to damage the site's public relations.
  3780	
  3781	   5.3.3  Choice of Language
  3782	
  3783	      The choice of language used when notifying people about the
  3784	      incident can have a profound effect on the way that information is
  3785	      received.  When you use emotional or inflammatory terms, you raise
  3786	      the expectations of damage and negative outcomes of the incident.
  3787	      It is important to remain calm both in written and spoken
  3788	      notifications.
  3789	
  3790	      Another issue associated with the choice of language is the
  3791	      notification to non-technical or off-site personnel.  It is
  3792	      important to accurately describe the incident without undue alarm
  3793	      or confusing messages.  While it is more difficult to describe the
  3794	      incident to a non-technical audience, it is often more important.
  3795	      A non-technical description may be required for upper-level
  3796	      management, the press, or law enforcement liaisons.  The
  3797	      importance of these notifications cannot be underestimated and may
  3798	      make the difference between handling the incident properly and
  3799	      escalating to some higher level of damage.

  3807	
  3808	
  3809	   5.3.4  Notification of Individuals
  3810	
  3811	         o Point of Contact (POC) people (Technical, Administrative,
  3812	           Response Teams, Investigative, Legal, Vendors, Service
  3813	           providers), and which POCs are visible to whom.
  3814	         o Wider community (users).
  3815	         o Other sites that might be affected.
  3816	
  3817	      Finally, there is the question of who should be notified during
  3818	      and after the incident.  There are several classes of individuals
  3819	      that need to be considered for notification.  These are the
  3820	      technical personnel, administration, appropriate response teams
  3821	      (such as CERT or CIAC), law enforcement, vendors, and other
  3822	      service providers.  These issues are important for the central
  3823	      point of contact, since that is the person responsible for the
  3824	      actual notification of others (see section 5.3.6 for further
  3825	      information).  A list of people in each of these categories is an
  3826	      important time saver for the POC during an incident.  It is much
  3827	      more difficult to find an appropriate person during an incident
  3828	      when many urgent events are ongoing.
  3829	
  3830	      In addition to the people responsible for handling part of the
  3831	      incident, there may be other sites affected by the incident (or
  3832	      perhaps simply at risk from the incident).  A wider community of
  3833	      users may also benefit from knowledge of the incident.  Often, a
  3834	      report of the incident once it is closed out is appropriate for
  3835	      publication to the wider user community.
  3836	
  3837	   5.3.5  Public Relations - Press Releases
  3838	
  3839	      One of the most important issues to consider is when, who, and how
  3840	      much to release to the general public through the press.  There
  3841	      are many issues to consider when deciding this particular issue.
  3842	      First and foremost, if a public relations office exists for the
  3843	      site, it is important to use this office as liaison to the press.
  3844	      The public relations office is trained in the type and wording of
  3845	      information released, and will help to assure that the image of
  3846	      the site is protected during and after the incident (if possible).
  3847	      A public relations office has the advantage that you can
  3848	      communicate candidly with them, and provide a buffer between the
  3849	      constant press attention and the need of the POC to maintain
  3850	      control over the incident.
  3851	
  3852	      If a public relations office is not available, the information
  3853	      released to the press must be carefully considered.  If the
  3854	      information is sensitive, it may be advantageous to provide only
  3855	      minimal or overview information to the press.  It is quite
  3856	      possible that any information provided to the press will be
  3857	
  3858	
  3859	
  3860	Site Security Policy Handbook Working Group                    [Page 69]

  3863	
  3864	
  3865	      quickly reviewed by the perpetrator of the incident.  As a
  3866	      contrast to this consideration, it was discussed above that
  3867	      misleading the press can often backfire and cause more damage than
  3868	      releasing sensitive information.
  3869	
  3870	      While it is difficult to determine in advance what level of detail
  3871	      to provide to the press, some guidelines to keep in mind are:
  3872	
  3873	         o Keep the technical level of detail low.  Detailed
  3874	           information about the incident may provide enough
  3875	           information for copy-cat events or even damage the
  3876	           site's ability to prosecute once the event is over.
  3877	         o Keep the speculation out of press statements.
  3878	           Speculation of who is causing the incident or the
  3879	           motives are very likely to be in error and may cause
  3880	           an inflamed view of the incident.
  3881	         o Work with law enforcement professionals to assure that
  3882	           evidence is protected.  If prosecution is involved,
  3883	           assure that the evidence collected is not divulged to
  3884	           the press.
  3885	         o Try not to be forced into a press interview before you are
  3886	           prepared.  The popular press is famous for the "2am"
  3887	           interview, where the hope is to catch the interviewee off
  3888	           guard and obtain information otherwise not available.
  3889	         o Do not allow the press attention to detract from the
  3890	           handling of the event.  Always remember that the successful
  3891	           closure of an incident is of primary importance.
  3892	
  3893	   5.3.6  Who Needs to Get Involved?
  3894	
  3895	      There now exists a number of incident response teams (IRTs) such
  3896	      as the CERT and the CIAC. (See sections 3.9.7.3.1 and 3.9.7.3.4.)
  3897	      Teams exists for many major government agencies and large
  3898	      corporations.  If such a team is available for your site, the
  3899	      notification of this team should be of primary importance during
  3900	      the early stages of an incident.  These teams are responsible for
  3901	      coordinating computer security incidents over a range of sites and
  3902	      larger entities.  Even if the incident is believed to be contained
  3903	      to a single site, it is possible that the information available
  3904	      through a response team could help in closing out the incident.
  3905	
  3906	      In setting up a site policy for incident handling, it may be
  3907	      desirable to create an incident handling team (IHT), much like
  3908	      those teams that already exist, that will be responsible for
  3909	      handling computer security incidents for the site (or
  3910	      organization).  If such a team is created, it is essential that
  3911	      communication lines be opened between this team and other IHTs.
  3912	      Once an incident is under way, it is difficult to open a trusted
  3913

  3921	      dialogue between other IHTs if none has existed before.
  3922	
  3923	5.4  Response
  3924	
  3925	   A major topic still untouched here is how to actually respond to an
  3926	   event.  The response to an event will fall into the general
  3927	   categories of containment, eradication, recovery, and follow-up.
  3928	
  3929	   Containment
  3930	
  3931	      The purpose of containment is to limit the extent of an attack.
  3932	      For example, it is important to limit the spread of a worm attack
  3933	      on a network as quickly as possible.  An essential part of
  3934	      containment is decision making (i.e., determining whether to shut
  3935	      a system down, to disconnect from a network, to monitor system or
  3936	      network activity, to set traps, to disable functions such as
  3937	      remote file transfer on a UNIX system, etc.).  Sometimes this
  3938	      decision is trivial; shut the system down if the system is
  3939	      classified or sensitive, or if proprietary information is at risk!
  3940	      In other cases, it is worthwhile to risk having some damage to the
  3941	      system if keeping the system up might enable you to identify an
  3942	      intruder.
  3943	
  3944	      The third stage, containment, should involve carrying out
  3945	      predetermined procedures.  Your organization or site should, for
  3946	      example, define acceptable risks in dealing with an incident, and
  3947	      should prescribe specific actions and strategies accordingly.
  3948	      Finally, notification of cognizant authorities should occur during
  3949	      this stage.
  3950	
  3951	   Eradication
  3952	
  3953	      Once an incident has been detected, it is important to first think
  3954	      about containing the incident.  Once the incident has been
  3955	      contained, it is now time to eradicate the cause.  Software may be
  3956	      available to help you in this effort.  For example, eradication
  3957	      software is available to eliminate most viruses which infect small
  3958	      systems.  If any bogus files have been created, it is time to
  3959	      delete them at this point.  In the case of virus infections, it is
  3960	      important to clean and reformat any disks containing infected
  3961	      files.  Finally, ensure that all backups are clean.  Many systems
  3962	      infected with viruses become periodically reinfected simply
  3963	      because people do not systematically eradicate the virus from
  3964	      backups.
  3965	
  3966	   Recovery
  3967	
  3968	      Once the cause of an incident has been eradicated, the recovery
  3969	
  3970	
  3971

  3975	
  3976	
  3977	      phase defines the next stage of action.  The goal of recovery is
  3978	      to return the system to normal.  In the case of a network-based
  3979	      attack, it is important to install patches for any operating
  3980	      system vulnerability which was exploited.
  3981	
  3982	   Follow-up
  3983	
  3984	      One of the most important stages of responding to incidents is
  3985	      also the most often omitted---the follow-up stage.  This stage is
  3986	      important because it helps those involved in handling the incident
  3987	      develop a set of "lessons learned" (see section 6.3) to improve
  3988	      future performance in such situations.  This stage also provides
  3989	      information which justifies an organization's computer security
  3990	      effort to management, and yields information which may be
  3991	      essential in legal proceedings.
  3992	
  3993	      The most important element of the follow-up stage is performing a
  3994	      postmortem analysis.  Exactly what happened, and at what times?
  3995	      How well did the staff involved with the incident perform?  What
  3996	      kind of information did the staff need quickly, and how could they
  3997	      have gotten that information as soon as possible?  What would the
  3998	      staff do differently next time?  A follow-up report is valuable
  3999	      because it provides a reference to be used in case of other
  4000	      similar incidents.  Creating a formal chronology of events
  4001	      (including time stamps) is also important for legal reasons.
  4002	      Similarly, it is also important to as quickly obtain a monetary
  4003	      estimate of the amount of damage the incident caused in terms of
  4004	      any loss of software and files, hardware damage, and manpower
  4005	      costs to restore altered files, reconfigure affected systems, and
  4006	      so forth.  This estimate may become the basis for subsequent
  4007	      prosecution activity by the FBI, the U.S. Attorney General's
  4008	      Office, etc..
  4009	
  4010	   5.4.1  What Will You Do?
  4011	
  4012	      o Restore control.
  4013	      o Relation to policy.
  4014	      o Which level of service is needed?
  4015	      o Monitor activity.
  4016	      o Constrain or shut down system.
  4017	
  4018	   5.4.2  Consider Designating a "Single Point of Contact"
  4019	
  4020	      When an incident is under way, a major issue is deciding who is in
  4021	      charge of coordinating the activity of the multitude of players.
  4022	      A major mistake that can be made is to have a number of "points of
  4023	      contact" (POC) that are not pulling their efforts together.  This
  4024	      will only add to the confusion of the event, and will probably
  4025	
  4026	
  4027	
  4028	Site Security Policy Handbook Working Group                    [Page 72]

  4030	RFC 1244                 Site Security Handbook                July 1991
  4031	
  4032	
  4033	      lead to additional confusion and wasted or ineffective effort.
  4034	
  4035	      The single point of contact may or may not be the person "in
  4036	      charge" of the incident.  There are two distinct rolls to fill
  4037	      when deciding who shall be the point of contact and the person in
  4038	      charge of the incident.  The person in charge will make decisions
  4039	      as to the interpretation of policy applied to the event.  The
  4040	      responsibility for the handling of the event falls onto this
  4041	      person.  In contrast, the point of contact must coordinate the
  4042	      effort of all the parties involved with handling the event.
  4043	
  4044	      The point of contact must be a person with the technical expertise
  4045	      to successfully coordinate the effort of the system managers and
  4046	      users involved in monitoring and reacting to the attack.  Often
  4047	      the management structure of a site is such that the administrator
  4048	      of a set of resources is not a technically competent person with
  4049	      regard to handling the details of the operations of the computers,
  4050	      but is ultimately responsible for the use of these resources.
  4051	
  4052	      Another important function of the POC is to maintain contact with
  4053	      law enforcement and other external agencies (such as the CIA, DoD,
  4054	      U.S.  Army, or others) to assure that multi-agency involvement
  4055	      occurs.
  4056	
  4057	      Finally, if legal action in the form of prosecution is involved,
  4058	      the POC may be able to speak for the site in court.  The
  4059	      alternative is to have multiple witnesses that will be hard to
  4060	      coordinate in a legal sense, and will weaken any case against the
  4061	      attackers.  A single POC may also be the single person in charge
  4062	      of evidence collected, which will keep the number of people
  4063	      accounting for evidence to a minimum.  As a rule of thumb, the
  4064	      more people that touch a potential piece of evidence, the greater
  4065	      the possibility that it will be inadmissible in court.  The
  4066	      section below (Legal/Investigative) will provide more details for
  4067	      consideration on this topic.
  4068	
  4069	5.5  Legal/Investigative
  4070	
  4071	   5.5.1  Establishing Contacts with Investigative Agencies
  4072	
  4073	      It is important to establish contacts with personnel from
  4074	      investigative agencies such as the FBI and Secret Service as soon
  4075	      as possible, for several reasons.  Local law enforcement and local
  4076	      security offices or campus police organizations should also be
  4077	      informed when appropriate.  A primary reason is that once a major
  4078	      attack is in progress, there is little time to call various
  4079	      personnel in these agencies to determine exactly who the correct
  4080	      point of contact is.  Another reason is that it is important to
  4081	
  4082	
  4083	
  4084	Site Security Policy Handbook Working Group                    [Page 73]
  4085	
  4086	RFC 1244                 Site Security Handbook                July 1991
  4087	
  4088	
  4089	      cooperate with these agencies in a manner that will foster a good
  4090	      working relationship, and that will be in accordance with the
  4091	      working procedures of these agencies.  Knowing the working
  4092	      procedures in advance and the expectations of your point of
  4093	      contact is a big step in this direction.  For example, it is
  4094	      important to gather evidence that will be admissible in a court of
  4095	      law.  If you don't know in advance how to gather admissible
  4096	      evidence, your efforts to collect evidence during an incident are
  4097	      likely to be of no value to the investigative agency with which
  4098	      you deal.  A final reason for establishing contacts as soon as
  4099	      possible is that it is impossible to know the particular agency
  4100	      that will assume jurisdiction in any given incident.  Making
  4101	      contacts and finding the proper channels early will make
  4102	      responding to an incident go considerably more smoothly.
  4103	
  4104	      If your organization or site has a legal counsel, you need to
  4105	      notify this office soon after you learn that an incident is in
  4106	      progress.  At a minimum, your legal counsel needs to be involved
  4107	      to protect the legal and financial interests of your site or
  4108	      organization.  There are many legal and practical issues, a few of
  4109	      which are:
  4110	
  4111	         1. Whether your site or organization is willing to risk
  4112	            negative publicity or exposure to cooperate with legal
  4113	            prosecution efforts.
  4114	
  4115	         2. Downstream liability--if you leave a compromised system
  4116	            as is so it can be monitored and another computer is damaged
  4117	            because the attack originated from your system, your site or
  4118	            organization may be liable for damages incurred.
  4119	
  4120	         3. Distribution of information--if your site or organization
  4121	            distributes information about an attack in which another
  4122	            site or organization may be involved or the vulnerability
  4123	            in a product that may affect ability to market that
  4124	            product, your site or organization may again be liable
  4125	            for any damages (including damage of reputation).
  4126	
  4127	         4. Liabilities due to monitoring--your site or organization
  4128	            may be sued if users at your site or elsewhere discover
  4129	            that your site is monitoring account activity without
  4130	            informing users.
  4131	
  4132	      Unfortunately, there are no clear precedents yet on the
  4133	      liabilities or responsibilities of organizations involved in a
  4134	      security incident or who might be involved in supporting an
  4135	      investigative effort.  Investigators will often encourage
  4136	      organizations to help trace and monitor intruders -- indeed, most
  4137	
  4138	
  4139	
  4140	Site Security Policy Handbook Working Group                    [Page 74]
  4141	
  4142	RFC 1244                 Site Security Handbook                July 1991
  4143	
  4144	
  4145	      investigators cannot pursue computer intrusions without extensive
  4146	      support from the organizations involved.  However, investigators
  4147	      cannot provide protection from liability claims, and these kinds
  4148	      of efforts may drag out for months and may take lots of effort.
  4149	
  4150	      On the other side, an organization's legal council may advise
  4151	      extreme caution and suggest that tracing activities be halted and
  4152	      an intruder shut out of the system.  This in itself may not
  4153	      provide protection from liability, and may prevent investigators
  4154	      from identifying anyone.
  4155	
  4156	      The balance between supporting investigative activity and limiting
  4157	      liability is tricky; you'll need to consider the advice of your
  4158	      council and the damage the intruder is causing (if any) in making
  4159	      your decision about what to do during any particular incident.
  4160	
  4161	      Your legal counsel should also be involved in any decision to
  4162	      contact investigative agencies when an incident occurs at your
  4163	      site.  The decision to coordinate efforts with investigative
  4164	      agencies is most properly that of your site or organization.
  4165	      Involving your legal counsel will also foster the multi-level
  4166	      coordination between your site and the particular investigative
  4167	      agency involved which in turn results in an efficient division of
  4168	      labor.  Another result is that you are likely to obtain guidance
  4169	      that will help you avoid future legal mistakes.
  4170	
  4171	      Finally, your legal counsel should evaluate your site's written
  4172	      procedures for responding to incidents.  It is essential to obtain
  4173	      a "clean bill of health" from a legal perspective before you
  4174	      actually carry out these procedures.
  4175	
  4176	   5.5.2  Formal and Informal Legal Procedures
  4177	
  4178	      One of the most important considerations in dealing with
  4179	      investigative agencies is verifying that the person who calls
  4180	      asking for information is a legitimate representative from the
  4181	      agency in question.  Unfortunately, many well intentioned people
  4182	      have unknowingly leaked sensitive information about incidents,
  4183	      allowed unauthorized people into their systems, etc., because a
  4184	      caller has masqueraded as an FBI or Secret Service agent.  A
  4185	      similar consideration is using a secure means of communication.
  4186	      Because many network attackers can easily reroute electronic mail,
  4187	      avoid using electronic mail to communicate with other agencies (as
  4188	      well as others dealing with the incident at hand).  Non-secured
  4189	      phone lines (e.g., the phones normally used in the business world)
  4190	      are also frequent targets for tapping by network intruders, so be
  4191	      careful!
  4192	
  4193	
  4194	
  4195	
  4196	Site Security Policy Handbook Working Group                    [Page 75]
  4197	
  4198	RFC 1244                 Site Security Handbook                July 1991
  4199	
  4200	
  4201	      There is no established set of rules for responding to an incident
  4202	      when the U.S. Federal Government becomes involved.  Except by
  4203	      court order, no agency can force you to monitor, to disconnect
  4204	      from the network, to avoid telephone contact with the suspected
  4205	      attackers, etc..  As discussed in section 5.5.1, you should
  4206	      consult the matter with your legal counsel, especially before
  4207	      taking an action that your organization has never taken.  The
  4208	      particular agency involved may ask you to leave an attacked
  4209	      machine on and to monitor activity on this machine, for example.
  4210	      Your complying with this request will ensure continued cooperation
  4211	      of the agency--usually the best route towards finding the source
  4212	      of the network attacks and, ultimately, terminating these attacks.
  4213	      Additionally, you may need some information or a favor from the
  4214	      agency involved in the incident.  You are likely to get what you
  4215	      need only if you have been cooperative.  Of particular importance
  4216	      is avoiding unnecessary or unauthorized disclosure of information
  4217	      about the incident, including any information furnished by the
  4218	      agency involved.  The trust between your site and the agency
  4219	      hinges upon your ability to avoid compromising the case the agency
  4220	      will build; keeping "tight lipped" is imperative.
  4221	
  4222	      Sometimes your needs and the needs of an investigative agency will
  4223	      differ.  Your site may want to get back to normal business by
  4224	      closing an attack route, but the investigative agency may want you
  4225	      to keep this route open.  Similarly, your site may want to close a
  4226	      compromised system down to avoid the possibility of negative
  4227	      publicity, but again the investigative agency may want you to
  4228	      continue monitoring.  When there is such a conflict, there may be
  4229	      a complex set of tradeoffs (e.g., interests of your site's
  4230	      management, amount of resources you can devote to the problem,
  4231	      jurisdictional boundaries, etc.).  An important guiding principle
  4232	      is related to what might be called "Internet citizenship" [22,
  4233	      IAB89, 23] and its responsibilities.  Your site can shut a system
  4234	      down, and this will relieve you of the stress, resource demands,
  4235	      and danger of negative exposure.  The attacker, however, is likely
  4236	      to simply move on to another system, temporarily leaving others
  4237	      blind to the attacker's intention and actions until another path
  4238	      of attack can be detected.  Providing that there is no damage to
  4239	      your systems and others, the most responsible course of action is
  4240	      to cooperate with the participating agency by leaving your
  4241	      compromised system on.  This will allow monitoring (and,
  4242	      ultimately, the possibility of terminating the source of the
  4243	      threat to systems just like yours).  On the other hand, if there
  4244	      is damage to computers illegally accessed through your system, the
  4245	      choice is more complicated: shutting down the intruder may prevent
  4246	      further damage to systems, but might make it impossible to track
  4247	      down the intruder.  If there has been damage, the decision about
  4248	      whether it is important to leave systems up to catch the intruder
  4249	
  4250

  4255	
  4256	
  4257	      should involve all the organizations effected.  Further
  4258	      complicating the issue of network responsibility is the
  4259	      consideration that if you do not cooperate with the agency
  4260	      involved, you will be less likely to receive help from that agency
  4261	      in the future.
  4262	
  4263	5.6  Documentation Logs
  4264	
  4265	   When you respond to an incident, document all details related to the
  4266	   incident.  This will provide valuable information to yourself and
  4267	   others as you try to unravel the course of events.  Documenting all
  4268	   details will ultimately save you time.  If you don't document every
  4269	   relevant phone call, for example, you are likely to forget a good
  4270	   portion of information you obtain, requiring you to contact the
  4271	   source of information once again.  This wastes yours and others'
  4272	   time, something you can ill afford.  At the same time, recording
  4273	   details will provide evidence for prosecution efforts, providing the
  4274	   case moves in this direction.  Documenting an incident also will help
  4275	   you perform a final assessment of damage (something your management
  4276	   as well as law enforcement officers will want to know), and will
  4277	   provide the basis for a follow-up analysis in which you can engage in
  4278	   a valuable "lessons learned" exercise.
  4279	
  4280	   During the initial stages of an incident, it is often infeasible to
  4281	   determine whether prosecution is viable, so you should document as if
  4282	   you are gathering evidence for a court case.  At a minimum, you
  4283	   should record:
  4284	
  4285	      o All system events (audit records).
  4286	      o All actions you take (time tagged).
  4287	      o All phone conversations (including the person with whom
  4288	        you talked, the date and time, and the content of the
  4289	        conversation).
  4290	
  4291	   The most straightforward way to maintain documentation is keeping a
  4292	   log book.  This allows you to go to a centralized, chronological
  4293	   source of information when you need it, instead of requiring you to
  4294	   page through individual sheets of paper.  Much of this information is
  4295	   potential evidence in a court of law.  Thus, when you initially
  4296	   suspect that an incident will result in prosecution or when an
  4297	   investigative agency becomes involved, you need to regularly (e.g.,
  4298	   every day) turn in photocopied, signed copies of your logbook (as
  4299	   well as media you use to record system events) to a document
  4300	   custodian who can store these copied pages in a secure place (e.g., a
  4301	   safe).  When you submit information for storage, you should in return
  4302	   receive a signed, dated receipt from the document custodian.  Failure
  4303	   to observe these procedures can result in invalidation of any
  4304	   evidence you obtain in a court of law.

  4313	6.  Establishing Post-Incident Procedures
  4314	
  4315	6.1  Overview
  4316	
  4317	   In the wake of an incident, several actions should take place.  These
  4318	   actions can be summarized as follows:
  4319	
  4320	      1. An inventory should be taken of the systems' assets,
  4321	         i.e., a careful examination should determine how the
  4322	         system was affected by the incident,
  4323	
  4324	      2. The lessons learned as a result of the incident
  4325	         should be included in revised security plan to
  4326	         prevent the incident from re-occurring,
  4327	
  4328	      3. A new risk analysis should be developed in light of the
  4329	         incident,
  4330	
  4331	      4. An investigation and prosecution of the individuals
  4332	         who caused the incident should commence, if it is
  4333	         deemed desirable.
  4334	
  4335	   All four steps should provide feedback to the site security policy
  4336	   committee, leading to prompt re-evaluation and amendment of the
  4337	   current policy.
  4338	
  4339	6.2  Removing Vulnerabilities
  4340	
  4341	   Removing all vulnerabilities once an incident has occurred is
  4342	   difficult.  The key to removing vulnerabilities is knowledge and
  4343	   understanding of the breach.  In some cases, it is prudent to remove
  4344	   all access or functionality as soon as possible, and then restore
  4345	   normal operation in limited stages.  Bear in mind that removing all
  4346	   access while an incident is in progress will obviously notify all
  4347	   users, including the alleged problem users, that the administrators
  4348	   are aware of a problem; this may have a deleterious effect on an
  4349	   investigation.  However, allowing an incident to continue may also
  4350	   open the likelihood of greater damage, loss, aggravation, or
  4351	   liability (civil or criminal).
  4352	
  4353	   If it is determined that the breach occurred due to a flaw in the
  4354	   systems' hardware or software, the vendor (or supplier) and the CERT
  4355	   should be notified as soon as possible.  Including relevant telephone
  4356	   numbers (also electronic mail addresses and fax numbers) in the site
  4357	   security policy is strongly recommended.  To aid prompt
  4358	   acknowledgment and understanding of the problem, the flaw should be
  4359	   described in as much detail as possible, including details about how
  4360	   to exploit the flaw.

  4367	
  4368	
  4369	   As soon as the breach has occurred, the entire system and all its
  4370	   components should be considered suspect.  System software is the most
  4371	   probable target.  Preparation is key to recovering from a possibly
  4372	   tainted system.  This includes checksumming all tapes from the vendor
  4373	   using a checksum algorithm which (hopefully) is resistant to
  4374	   tampering [10].  (See sections 3.9.4.1, 3.9.4.2.)  Assuming original
  4375	   vendor distribution tapes are available, an analysis of all system
  4376	   files should commence, and any irregularities should be noted and
  4377	   referred to all parties involved in handling the incident.  It can be
  4378	   very difficult, in some cases, to decide which backup tapes to
  4379	   recover from; consider that the incident may have continued for
  4380	   months or years before discovery, and that the suspect may be an
  4381	   employee of the site, or otherwise have intimate knowledge or access
  4382	   to the systems.  In all cases, the pre-incident preparation will
  4383	   determine what recovery is possible.  At worst-case, restoration from
  4384	   the original manufactures' media and a re-installation of the systems
  4385	   will be the most prudent solution.
  4386	
  4387	   Review the lessons learned from the incident and always update the
  4388	   policy and procedures to reflect changes necessitated by the
  4389	   incident.
  4390	
  4391	   6.2.1  Assessing Damage
  4392	
  4393	      Before cleanup can begin, the actual system damage must be
  4394	      discerned.  This can be quite time consuming, but should lead into
  4395	      some of the insight as to the nature of the incident, and aid
  4396	      investigation and prosecution.  It is best to compare previous
  4397	      backups or original tapes when possible; advance preparation is
  4398	      the key.  If the system supports centralized logging (most do), go
  4399	      back over the logs and look for abnormalities.  If process
  4400	      accounting and connect time accounting is enabled, look for
  4401	      patterns of system usage.  To a lesser extent, disk usage may shed
  4402	      light on the incident.  Accounting can provide much helpful
  4403	      information in an analysis of an incident and subsequent
  4404	      prosecution.
  4405	
  4406	   6.2.2  Cleanup
  4407	
  4408	      Once the damage has been assessed, it is necessary to develop a
  4409	      plan for system cleanup.  In general, bringing up services in the
  4410	      order of demand to allow a minimum of user inconvenience is the
  4411	      best practice.  Understand that the proper recovery procedures for
  4412	      the system are extremely important and should be specific to the
  4413	      site.
  4414	
  4415	      It may be necessary to go back to the original distributed tapes
  4416	      and recustomize the system.  To facilitate this worst case
  4417	
  4418

  4423	
  4424	
  4425	      scenario, a record of the original systems setup and each
  4426	      customization change should be kept current with each change to
  4427	      the system.
  4428	
  4429	   6.2.3  Follow up
  4430	
  4431	      Once you believe that a system has been restored to a "safe"
  4432	      state, it is still possible that holes and even traps could be
  4433	      lurking in the system.  In the follow-up stage, the system should
  4434	      be monitored for items that may have been missed during the
  4435	      cleanup stage.  It would be prudent to utilize some of the tools
  4436	      mentioned in section 3.9.8.2 (e.g., COPS) as a start.  Remember,
  4437	      these tools don't replace continual system monitoring and good
  4438	      systems administration procedures.
  4439	
  4440	   6.2.4  Keep a Security Log
  4441	
  4442	      As discussed in section 5.6, a security log can be most valuable
  4443	      during this phase of removing vulnerabilities.  There are two
  4444	      considerations here; the first is to keep logs of the procedures
  4445	      that have been used to make the system secure again.  This should
  4446	      include command procedures (e.g., shell scripts) that can be run
  4447	      on a periodic basis to recheck the security.  Second, keep logs of
  4448	      important system events.  These can be referenced when trying to
  4449	      determine the extent of the damage of a given incident.
  4450	
  4451	6.3  Capturing Lessons Learned
  4452	
  4453	   6.3.1  Understand the Lesson
  4454	
  4455	      After an incident, it is prudent to write a report describing the
  4456	      incident, method of discovery, correction procedure, monitoring
  4457	      procedure, and a summary of lesson learned.  This will aid in the
  4458	      clear understanding of the problem.  Remember, it is difficult to
  4459	      learn from an incident if you don't understand the source.
  4460	
  4461	   6.3.2  Resources
  4462	
  4463	      6.3.2.1  Other Security Devices, Methods
  4464	
  4465	         Security is a dynamic, not static process.  Sites are dependent
  4466	         on the nature of security available at each site, and the array
  4467	         of devices and methods that will help promote security.
  4468	         Keeping up with the security area of the computer industry and
  4469	         their methods will assure a security manager of taking
  4470	         advantage of the latest technology.

  4481	      6.3.2.2  Repository of Books, Lists, Information Sources
  4482	
  4483	         Keep an on site collection of books, lists, information
  4484	         sources, etc., as guides and references for securing the
  4485	         system.  Keep this collection up to date.  Remember, as systems
  4486	         change, so do security methods and problems.
  4487	
  4488	      6.3.2.3  Form a Subgroup
  4489	
  4490	         Form a subgroup of system administration personnel that will be
  4491	         the core security staff.  This will allow discussions of
  4492	         security problems and multiple views of the site's security
  4493	         issues.  This subgroup can also act to develop the site
  4494	         security policy and make suggested changes as necessary to
  4495	         ensure site security.
  4496	
  4497	6.4  Upgrading Policies and Procedures
  4498	
  4499	   6.4.1  Establish Mechanisms for Updating Policies, Procedures,
  4500	          and Tools
  4501	
  4502	      If an incident is based on poor policy, and unless the policy is
  4503	      changed, then one is doomed to repeat the past.  Once a site has
  4504	      recovered from and incident, site policy and procedures should be
  4505	      reviewed to encompass changes to prevent similar incidents.  Even
  4506	      without an incident, it would be prudent to review policies and
  4507	      procedures on a regular basis.  Reviews are imperative due to
  4508	      today's changing computing environments.
  4509	
  4510	   6.4.2  Problem Reporting Procedures
  4511	
  4512	      A problem reporting procedure should be implemented to describe,
  4513	      in detail, the incident and the solutions to the incident.  Each
  4514	      incident should be reviewed by the site security subgroup to allow
  4515	      understanding of the incident with possible suggestions to the
  4516	      site policy and procedures.

  4763	           As computer security becomes a more important issue in
  4764	           modern society, it begins to warrant a systematic approach.
  4765	           The vast majority of the computer security problems and the
  4766	           costs associated with them can be prevented with simple
  4767	           inexpensive measures.  The most important and cost
  4768	           effective of these measures are available in the prevention
  4769	           and planning phases.  These methods are presented in this
  4770	           paper, followed by a simplified guide to incident
  4771	           handling and recovery.  Available on-line from:

  4778	
  4779	           Brief abstract (slight paraphrase from the original
  4780	           abstract): AT&T maintains a large internal Internet that
  4781	           needs to be protected from outside attacks, while
  4782	           providing useful services between the two.
  4783	           This paper describes AT&T's Internet gateway.  This
  4784	           gateway passes mail and many of the common Internet
  4785	           services between AT&T internal machines and the Internet.
  4786	           This is accomplished without IP connectivity using a pair
  4787	           of machines: a trusted internal machine and an untrusted
  4788	           external gateway.  These are connected by a private link.
  4789	           The internal machine provides a few carefully-guarded
  4790	           services to the external gateway.  This configuration
  4791	           helps protect the internal internet even if the external
  4792	           machine is fully compromised.
  4793	
  4794	           This is a very useful and interesting design.  Most
  4795	           firewall gateway systems rely on a system that, if
  4796	           compromised, could allow access to the machines behind
  4797	           the firewall.  Also, most firewall systems require users
  4798	           who want access to Internet services to have accounts on
  4799	           the firewall machine.  AT&T's design allows AT&T internal
  4800	           internet users access to the standard services of TELNET and
  4801	           FTP from their own workstations without accounts on
  4802	           the firewall machine.  A very useful paper that shows
  4803	           how to maintain some of the benefits of Internet
  4804	           connectivity while still maintaining strong
  4805	           security.

  4820	
  4821	           This paper describes measures that you, as a system
  4822	           administrator can take to make your UNIX system(s) more
  4823	           secure.  Oriented primarily at SunOS 4.x, most of the
  4824	           information covered applies equally well to any Berkeley
  4825	           UNIX system with or without NFS and/or Yellow Pages (NIS).
  4826	           Some of the information can also be applied to System V,

  4836	
  4837	           This book serves as a good guide to the issues encountered
  4838	           in forming computer security policies and procedures.  The
  4839	           book is designed as a textbook for an introductory course
  4840	           in information systems security.
  4841	
  4842	           The book is divided into five sections: Risk Management (I),
  4843	           Safeguards: security and control measures, organizational
  4844	           and administrative (II), Safeguards: Security and Control
  4845	           Measures, Technical (III), Legal Environment and
  4846	           Professionalism (IV), and CICA Computer Control Guidelines
  4847	           (V).
  4848	
  4849	           The book is particularly notable for its straight-forward
  4850	           approach to security, emphasizing that common sense is the
  4851	           first consideration in designing a security program.  The
  4852	           authors note that there is a tendency to look to more
  4853	           technical solutions to security problems while overlooking
  4854	           organizational controls which are often cheaper and much
  4855	           more effective.  298 pages, including references and index.

  4873	           security.  The first part of the book covers standard Unix
  4874	           and Unix security basics, with particular emphasis on
  4875	           passwords.  The second section covers enforcing security on
  4876	           the system.  Of particular interest to the Internet user are
  4877	           the sections on network security, which address many
  4878	           of the common security problems that afflict Internet Unix
  4879	           users.  Four chapters deal with handling security incidents,
  4880	           and the book concludes with discussions of encryption,
  4881	           physical security, and useful checklists and lists of
  4882	           resources.  The book lives up to its name; it is filled with
  4883	           specific references to possible security holes, files to
  4884	           check, and things to do to improve security.  This
  4885	           book is an excellent complement to this handbook.

  5066	           emergence of worldwide computer networks, electronic breakins,
  5067	           worms, viruses, counterculture (articles examining the world

  5071	           A thoughtful collection that addresses the phenomenon of
  5072	           attacks on computers.  This includes a number of previously
  5073	           published articles and some new ones.  The previously
  5074	           published ones are well chosen, and include some references
  5075	           that might be otherwise hard to obtain.  This book is a key
  5076	           reference to computer security threats that have generated
  5077	           much of the concern over computer security in recent years.

  5097	           From the preface: "The aim of this book is two-fold: (1) to
  5098	           describe some of the problems created by society by computers,
  5099	           and (2) to show how these problems present ethical dilemmas
  5100	           for computers professionals and computer users.
  5101	
  5102	           The problems created by computers arise, in turn, from two
  5103	           main sources: from hardware and software malfunctions and
  5104	           from misuse by human beings.  We argue that computer systems
  5105	           by their very nature are insecure, unreliable, and
  5106	           unpredictable -- and that society has yet to come to terms
  5107	           with the consequences.  We also seek to show how society
  5108	           has become newly vulnerable to human misuse of computers in
  5109	           the form of computer crime, software theft, hacking, the
  5110	           creation of viruses, invasions of privacy, and so on."
  5111	
  5112	           The eight chapters include "Computer Crime", "Software

  5335	
  5336	           The security provided by a password system depends on
  5337	           the passwords being kept secret at all times.  Thus, a
  5338	           password is vulnerable to compromise whenever it is used,
  5339	           stored, or even known.  In a password-based authentication
  5340	           mechanism implemented on an ADP system, passwords are
  5341	           vulnerable to compromise due to five essential aspects
  5342	           of the password system: 1) a password must be initially
  5343	           assigned to a user when enrolled on the ADP system;
  5344	           2) a user's password must be changed periodically;
  5345	           3) the ADP system must maintain a 'password
  5346	           database'; 4) users must remember their passwords; and
  5347	           5) users must enter their passwords into the ADP system at
  5348	           authentication time.  This guideline prescribes steps to be
  5349	           taken to minimize the vulnerability of passwords in each of
  5350	           these circumstances.

  5355	
  5356	           Audit trails are used to detect and deter penetration of
  5357	           a computer system and to reveal usage that identifies
  5358	           misuse.  At the discretion of the auditor, audit trails
  5359	           may be limited to specific events or may encompass all of
  5360	           the activities on a system.  Although not required by
  5361	           the criteria, it should be possible for the target of the
  5362	           audit mechanism to be either a subject or an object.  That
  5363	           is to say, the audit mechanism should be capable of
  5364	           monitoring every time John accessed the system as well as
  5365	           every time the nuclear reactor file was accessed; and

  5385	           user, or program operating on the user's behalf, is
  5386	           allowed to specify explicitly the types of access other
  5387	           users (or programs executing on their behalf) may have to
  5388	           information under the user's control.  [...]  Discretionary
  5389	           controls are not a replacement for mandatory controls.  In
  5390	           any environment in which information is protected,
  5391	           discretionary security provides for a finer granularity of
  5392	           control within the overall constraints of the mandatory
  5393	           policy.

  5400	           Configuration management consists of four separate tasks:
  5401	           identification, control, status accounting, and auditing.
  5402	           For every change that is made to an automated data
  5403	           processing (ADP) system, the design and requirements of the
  5404	           changed version of the system should be identified.  The
  5405	           control task of configuration management is performed
  5406	           by subjecting every change to documentation, hardware, and
  5407	           software/firmware to review and approval by an authorized
  5408	           authority.  Configuration status accounting is responsible
  5409	           for recording and reporting on the configuration of the
  5410	           product throughout the change.  Finally, though the process
  5411	           of a configuration audit, the completed change can be
  5412	           verified to be functionally correct, and for trusted
  5413	           systems, consistent with the security policy of the system.
