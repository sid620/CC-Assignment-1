    24	Introduction and Overview
    25	
    26		Virtual worlds technology promises to greatly expand both the 
    27	numbers of persons who use computers and the ways in which they 
    28	use them.  Already, the demand for applications of this technology 
    29	far exceeds the capability of the technology to satisfy these needs.  
    30	Independent development of virtual worlds technology has been the 
    31	norm for at least three decades, with researchers and developers 
    32	working privately to build unique virtual-worlds systems.  The 
    33	result has been redundancy and a slow pace of improvement in the 
    34	basic technology and its applications.  This paper proposes a "global 
    35	initiative" to coordinate and to some extent unify R&D activities 
    36	around the world, the quicker to satisfy an eager market (that may 
    37	not, however, stay eager for long) and meet genuine human needs.
    38	
    39	About Virtual Worlds
    40	
    41		The virtuality paradigm
    42	
    43		The virtuality paradigm redefines the human-computer inter-
    44	face.  In brief, it states that what we perceive, for us, _is_ the 
    45	world; and how we act upon it _is_ how we live.  There can be a 
    46	closer relationship between the images of the world we build in our 
    47	minds and bodies QJthe subjective models we build to represent an 
    48	"objective" world outside -- and the worlds we create within the 
    49	computer.  Enhancing a person's perceptions, understandings, and 
    50	actions should be the reason for which all computer systems are 
    51	built.
    52	
    53		Putting the person at the center of the computer system is not 
    54	as easy a task as it may sound.  People are difficult to "design with," 
    55	so it is much more appealing to engineers to design for them.  What 
    56	we get is systems that are the engineers' interpretation of what is 
    57	correct for people.  Particularly in the fields of machine interfaces 
    58	and software applications, the engineers need to be joined by people 
    59	with other orientations, like quality industrial designers, environ-
    60	mental psychologists and planners, and even artists.  If one accepts 
    61	the virtuality paradigm, then this collaboration is essential.
    62	
    63		In a virtual worlds system, the participants interact in a 
    64	natural way with digital objects within the computer-generated 
    65	environment.
    66	
    67		Currently, to generate such an environment, or virtual world, a 
    68	model is created.  Objects and their relationships are incorporated 
    69	in this model, which runs on a single powerful computer or on a 
    70	group of networked computers, with each contributing its slice of 
    71	the virtual pie.  Rendering engines display the models as visual and 
    72	aural information that mimics physical objects or designed abstrac-
    73	tions, in three dimensions.  These objects and/or abstractions are 
    74	presented to the participant via an LED- or LCD-based headset 
    75	mounted stereoscopic visual device and headphones.  A position-
    76	sensing device on the headset instructs the computer where the 
    77	participant is and where he or she is looking.  The participant also 
    78	wears a special glove glove or uses a Spaceball or similar tool to 
    79	maneuver through the world and manipulate objects within it.  The 
    80	computer or computers maintaining the world respond to the signals 
    81	from the sensors and tools and adjust the world accordingly.  The 
    82	net effect is a circumambience of information that is readily 
    83	accessible and susceptible to modification.
    84	
    85		The virtual world can assume the appearance of the physical 
    86	world, just as the objects within it can take on the characteristics 
    87	of objects in the physical world  The virtual world can be as simple 
    88	as the line imagery pioneered by Warren Robinett at the NASA Ames 
    89	Research Center in the 1980s or as complex as the molecular-
    90	modeling space now being refined at the University of North 
    91	Carolina.  A property common to all virtual worlds, however, is their 
    92	_spatiality._  Information within these worlds is presented in three 
    93	(or more) dimensions.  The participant, able to work in three or more 
    94	dimensions, experiences a wondrous synergy among mind and senses.
    95	
    96		Nearly everyone who enters a virtual world, while lamenting 
    97	the low resolution of today's visual presentations, experiences an 
    98	"Ah-hah!" when his or her spatial sense cuts in.  When three-dimen-
    99	sional sound (already well-developed) is added, the virtual world 
   100	attains a verisimilitude that, if not equal to the physical world, is 
   101	much more familiar than the usual computer interface.  We can see 
   102	and hear things  In the future, when the tactile interface is com-
   103	plete, we may touch them, too.  In only a few years (so we like to 
   104	think) the componentry of virtual interfaces will present credible 
   105	images that are of high resolution for all the senses.
   106	
   107		A critical history of virtual worlds invention
   108	
   109		The job of recounting the specific histories of various virtual 
   110	worlds developments has already been done, in Japan by Katsura 
   111	Hattori's _What's Virtual Reality?_ and in the U.S. by Howard 
   112	Rheingold's _Virtual Reality,_ Myron Krueger's _Artificial Reality 
   113	II,_ and other books to be published this year.  I want to emphasize 
   114	the individualistic character of the invention that has taken place so 
   115	far, which may explain why our technology is less than we would 
   116	have it be.
   117	
   118		Clearly, many inventors were inspired by science fiction 
   119	stories, in which people traveled through space and time, either 
   120	physically "teleporting" their bodies or sending their thoughts 
   121	around via telepathy.  Vannevar Bush was perhaps the first modern 
   122	computer scientist to conceive of knowledge as a medium through 
   123	which one might travel by machine.  His "Memex" was a fantasy 
   124	computer that would put all knowledge at the disposal of its user in 
   125	multimedia form,   Now Vannevar Bush's dream of universal access 
   126	to knowledge has become international.
   127	
   128		In the U.S., in the 1960s, Ivan Sutherland started experiment-
   129	ing with stereoscopic images created by a computer, to build a "data 
   130	field."  Around the same time, Myron Krueger, another American, was 
   131	using video cameras and other techniques to reverse the flow, put-
   132	ting the user "into" the computer terminal and merging him or her 
   133	with the images on the screen.  And, in the next decade, Thomas 
   134	Furness began directing the "Super Cockpit" project for the U.S. Air 
   135	Force, a completely pilot-attuned ensemble (complete with virtual 
   136	world projectors) that the pilot would wear.  While these eminences 
   137	knew of each other, their work did not coalesce but continued in dis-
   138	tinctly different directions:  Sutherland, toward flat-screen simula-
   139	tors; Krueger, deeper into art and media environments; and Furness, 
   140	toward continuing to refine data-presentation and manipulation.
   141		
   142		The popularization of virtual worlds occurred with the simpli-
   143	fication of a stereoscopic, head-mounted data display with position-
   144	sensors by NASA; and the subsequent commercialization of a similar 
   145	display complete with world-design software, the "Eyephones" and 
   146	"Body Electric/Swivel 3D" by VPL Research, in Redwood City, Cali-
   147	fornia.  With the appearance of these systems, and later the 3D 
   148	sound unit, the Convolvatron, marketed by Crystal River Engineering, 
   149	virtual worlds took off in the press and popular imagination.  Auto-
   150	desk, of Sausalito, California, announced its work on Cyberspace, a 
   151	3D CAD program.  Cyberspace begat Sense8, also of Sausalito, a 
   152	small firm working on a Sun workstation platform rather than the 
   153	traditional, more powerful Silicon Graphics computers that had been 
   154	the tradition until then.  For awhile it looked as if the Mattel Power-
   155	glove, a derivative of VPL's Dataglove developed by A.G.E., in New 
   156	York, might take virtual worlds into the exploding Nintendo game 
   157	market, but this did not occur.
   158	
   159		However, although work in virtual worlds was going on in many 
   160	places by the 1990s, almost all of this activity was completely 
   161	independent and uncoordinated.  Developments and inventions would 
   162	usually become known within the virtual worlds community only 
   163	after their introduction at one of the computer professional conven-
   164	tions or trade shows, and even so inventors liked to hold onto secret 
   165	code or hardware tricks to keep their pint-sized corporate empires 
   166	intact.  This tradition of individuality and secrecy is only slowly 
   167	being eroded by professional and social communications.  Unfortu-
   168	nately, it is no longer the legacy of small firms; today, many larger 
   169	firms practice the same self-serving tactics, to the disadvantage of 
   170	our field.
   171	
   172		The emerging virtual worlds industry
   173	
   174		Today, virtual worlds research is taking place around the 
   175	world.  Here, in Japan, research is taking place in many university 
   176	and MITI laboratories, as well as in private firms.  Fujitsu, Matsu-
   177	shita Electronics, and ATR are have interesting projects underway, 
   178	though none is yet what we might call commercial.  I am less an 
   179	expert in Japanese science than you are, but I understand that the 
   180	University of Tokyo, the Technical University of Tokyo, and Tsukuba 
   181	University are main centers of academic research in the field.  
   182	Japanese researchers are making deliberate gains, especially in the 
   183	fields of telerobotics and tactile worlds.  Nevertheless, while the 
   184	level of local activity is broad, it is not always as well funded as it 
   185	might be.  More than anywhere else, too, institutional boundaries 
   186	perhaps serve to isolate researchers from each other. This sympo-
   187	sium may signal a welcome end to these boundaries.  The Japanese 
   188	potential for cooperative, creative work has been demonstrated in 
   189	other fields and may be here, too.
   190	
   191		In North America, larger firms are joining in the research 
   192	effort.  Twelve companies, including Digital Equipment, Boeing, Sun, 
   193	Microsoft, Alias Research (the leading Canadian firm), and U S West 
   194	(a local telephone company) have joined in the Virtual Worlds 
   195	Consortium, which supports the virtual-worlds industrial R&D 
   196	conducted by Seattle's HIT Lab (the Human Interface Technology 
   197	Laboratory), where I work.  Also, firms are creating their own 
   198	research laboratories:  Boeing, Digital Equipment, Sun, Alias 
   199	Research, and Cray are among them.  Also, many more universities, 
   200	including the University of Central Florida, the University of 
   201	Alberta, Syracuse University, the University of Virginia, and MIT 
   202	have joined the University of North Carolina and the HIT Lab, at the 
   203	University of Washington, as North American centers of research 
   204	activity.  The tiny firms of TiNi Alloy, in Oakland, California, and 
   205	EXOS, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, have even begun to explore the 
   206	tactile environment -- how things "feel" in a virtual world.  The 
   207	pattern of individual, private enterprise holds, however, for large 
   208	firms and small.  With the possible exception of the Virtual Worlds 
   209	Consortium, one might justifiably say that the North American 
   210	industry is highly fragmented.
   211	
   212		Europe expresses an interesting paradox.  On the one hand, 
   213	nowhere is press attention to virtual worlds more extreme.  Artists 
   214	gather to ponder the value of this technology to their work, and 
   215	intellectuals pontificate on the philosophical meaning of cyberspace.  
   216	This in itself is not unusual; it occurs in Japan and North America, 
   217	too.  What is surprising is that, where this popular attention is 
   218	greatest, the work on virtual worlds is least advanced.  It is in the 
   219	European "hinterlands" where the exciting work is being done.  In 
   220	Britain, certainly off the Continental intellectual circuit, W Indus-
   221	tries is successfully pioneering virtual-worlds entertainment.  And 
   222	the Advanced Robotics Laboratory is building unusual tactile devices 
   223	for future worlds.  In Sweden, likewise off the beaten path, SICS, 
   224	the Swedish Institute for Computer Science; the Royal Institute of 
   225	Technology, in Stockholm; and Linkping University are collaborating 
   226	in the MultiG, or "Multi-Gigabit" project, to make televirtuality a 
   227	reality.  Perhaps the only really substantial Continental research is 
   228	taking place in three slightly peripheral sites:  3D acoustics at the 
   229	Ruhr University, in Bochum, Germany; general experimentation at the 
   230	CyberLab, at the University of Milan, Italy; and the excellent percep-
   231	tual research taking place at the Technical Universities of Delft, 
   232	Eindhoven, and Utrecht, in the Netherlands.  Once again, as in Japan 
   233	and North America, the European work is scattered and not well-
   234	related.
   235	
   236	Toward A  "Global Initiative"
   237	
   238		The problem:  ad hoc, uncoordinated development.
   239	
   240		Lack of coordination and communication in our field results in 
   241	several deleterious effects.  Among these are:
   242	
   243			% Duplicative projects make unnecessary demands
   244		on scarce labor and produce few advances (or, as we say
   245		in English, there is too much "reinventing of the wheel").
   246	
   247			% An overemphasis on highly visible research prob-
   248		lems (like a better visual display) leads to the neglect of
   249		less popular problems (like producing usable earprints for
   250		3D sound).
   251	
   252			% Interdisciplinary isolation (between fields, even 
   253		within the same organizations) denies the best-informed 
   254		solutions.
   255	
   256			% Rumors, suspicion, and premature competition sap
   257		the emotional energy of inventors and developers and hinder 
   258		the development of the field.
   259	
   260			% Commercial users' needs and general human needs
   261		go unmet, and potentially rich markets lie fallow.
   262	
   263		When we have time, we can talk about these observations at 
   264	greater length.  Although some of my colleagues may disagree about 
   265	the degree to which these conditions prevail, no one will deny that, 
   266	for now, they characterize many aspects of our infant virtual worlds 
   267	industry.
   268	
   269		The solution:  a global initiative.
   270	
   271		Perhaps the crisis is not yet felt acutely by all researchers 
   272	and developers, but at some point it will become clear to most that 
   273	premature competition and lack of cooperation is severely damaging 
   274	to our future interests.  In the few short years since 1989's first 
   275	Virtual Reality Day, it is not uncommon these days to come across 
   276	people who are despondent about virtual worlds technology.  They 
   277	relegate it to the same status as AI, or artificial intelligence, the 
   278	favorite scapegoat of the short-sighted.  These individuals have had 
   279	their expectations raised by sales pitches and the press -- and very 
   280	often, by their own imaginations -- only to discover that the 
   281	technology cannot do what they hoped it would.
   282	
   283		If this is not going to become a universal experience, we need 
   284	to take steps to bring our technology up to snuff.  We have perhaps 
   285	three to five years of public and, more importantly, commercial 
   286	tolerance of our need to experiment with trial and error.  After that, 
   287	if we have not produced virtual-worlds systems with applications 
   288	for the real world, our credibility will be seriously impaired.
   289	
   290		We must come to a common understanding on this point:  we 
   291	need to intensify and accelerate our research efforts.  We can build 
   292	upon this understanding to create an international, interdisciplinary 
   293	effort -- what I call the "Global Initiative."  The Global Initiative's 
   294	primary goal would be to hasten technological development in our 
   295	field by (1) opening better channels of communication; (2) ensuring 
   296	that rewards are equitably disbursed to researchers and developers 
   297	who have earned them; and (3) developing to the fullest the many 
   298	markets for virtual worlds technology, thus ensuring more than 
   299	enough work for everyone in the industry.  By the estimate of one 
   300	telecommunications company's analyst, the annual market for 
   301	virtual worlds-based technology and services, in the U.S. alone, is 
   302	over $1 trillion.  It doesn't matter if this figure is off by a factor of 
   303	one hundred or one thousand, it is still enormous; and the same is 
   304	true of every other advanced industrial market.
   305	
   306		We must recognize that there are more applications for this 
   307	technology than there are products to satisfy these demands.  And 
   308	we must meet them or watch our potential customers go elsewhere, 
   309	to other technologies like HDTV or computer-automated operation 
   310	that seem to offer an alterative to virtual worlds.  We know that 
   311	these other technologies cannot do the things our systems can do, 
   312	but others may not, and it is their confidence we must get and keep.
   313	
   314		I propose the following steps to produce cross-disciplinary, 
   315	interlaboratory, and international communications and cooperation, 
   316	which will lead us to our ultimate and common goal:
   317	
   318		1.  Establish for ourselves an identity as a distinct community 
   319	of researchers whose work is uniquely our own yet of benefit to 
   320	many communities outside our own.
   321	
   322		The publication of the new journal, _Presence,_ by the MIT 
   323	Press sometime this year will herald our academic credentials; but 
   324	we still need a way of unifying the work of the academy and the 
   325	commercial laboratories.
   326	
   327		2.  Initiate conferences bearing on our field.
   328	
   329		These days we are the honored guests of the giant internation-
   330	al computer conferences, SIGCHI (human-computer interaction) and 
   331	SIGGRAPH (computer graphics), and their national equivalents.  
   332	Tomorrow we may be out on the street.  In any case, participation in 
   333	these conferences ends up diluting  our attention and energy.  We do 
   334	not have enough time to talk among ourselves about what is impor-
   335	tant, and we do not hear from others outside the computer field.  At 
   336	our own conferences, we could share vital information efficiently 
   337	and also hear from others, outside the computer industry, whose 
   338	work is important to our own:  psychologists, architects, linguists, 
   339	designers, artists, and various end users.  It is time, I believe, to 
   340	seriously consider consolidating conferences like this week's, 
   341	sponsored by Nikkei; the HIT Lab's Industry Symposium on Virtual 
   342	Worlds Technology; the recent meeting at SRI International; and 
   343	others into one common annual meeting or a regular series of 
   344	moderately sized get-togethers.  We need to stop being exotic guests 
   345	and become homeowners and hosts.
   346	
   347		3.  Expand the reach of the USENET and other forums for 
   348	electronic information sharing.
   349	
   350		I mentioned earlier the emergence of _Presence,_ the MIT 
   351	Journal.  Even before the first issue of _Presence_ hits the stands, 
   352	however, there will have been over a year of professional dialogue 
   353	about our field, all conducted online, by computer network.  This is 
   354	the _sci.virtual-worlds_ newsgroup on the USENET, the global 
   355	public-service computer conferencing system.  Nearly every 
   356	university and many companies in North America, Western Europe, 
   357	Australia, and parts of Asia (mostly Japan and Tokyo) are tied to the 
   358	USENET.  Consequently, when the HIT Lab began hosting _sci.virtual-
   359	worlds_ in early 1990, even with our peers being so few and 
   360	scattered, we immediately signed up 500 users.  Now, with the 
   361	addition of Japan and Eastern Europe to the USENET, our numbers 
   362	have tripled and quadrupled.  The 1,500-2,000 people now using 
   363	_sci.virtual-worlds_ have generated over three megabytes of stored 
   364	text, which we archive on the University of Washington computer.  
   365	The quality of this newsgroup and the exchanges of information it 
   366	promotes suggests that we can make greater use of electronic 
   367	networks to our common benefit.
   368	
   369		4.  Start collaborative projects bilaterally and under the aegis 
   370	of national and international organizations.
   371	
   372		I do not know how this can be done, only that it should be done.  
   373	There exist mechanisms that provide favorable conditions for colla-
   374	borative research, both nationally and internationally, and they are 
   375	well used in other fields.  Why not our own?  At this early stage in 
   376	our science and industry, we stand to gain the most from building 
   377	good relationships and sharing knowledge.
   378	
   379		5.  Announce applications/products with common standards and 
   380	production characteristics.
   381	
   382		I saved this for last because it is the most controversial of my 
   383	proposals.  Standards are commonly taken to mean an end to com-
   384	petition, as it is often the case that established industries use 
   385	standards as an obstacle to new competitors with better ideas.  This 
   386	may well be the case in some fields, but in ours, it is the _lack_ of 
   387	standards is what is proving a hindrance.  It is the _lack_ of consis-
   388	tency, even down to the way componentry is wired or written about 
   389	in manuals, that is proving to be our constant nemesis.  Perhaps in 
   390	our field we can do things differently and begin to talk about pre-
   391	liminary standards now, before any one entity has a vested interest 
   392	in them.  When, over the next few years, as the systems we are 
   393	toying with become sufficiently stable, we should consider agreeing 
   394	on certain standards or specifications to carry us into the stage of 
   395	commercialization.  Then, when the technology is more advanced and 
   396	its applications more certain, we can revisit the issue of standards 
   397	and decide to keep what we have or go off in new directions.
   398	
   399		I will not get deeply into the organizational means for accom-
   400	plishing these ends; they are easily enough thought of.  Perhaps the 
   401	most important thing is to agree to start working on setting up the 
   402	channels of communication necessary to building our common future.
   403	
   404	Conclusion
   405	
   406		I am optimistic about the future of our field.  I believe that we 
   407	will make both technological and organizational progress in the next 
   408	five years that will astonish our critics and please our advocates.  
   409	Clearly, the move toward an international community, which I advo-
   410	cate in this paper, is already underway (although not yet firmly 
   411	established).
   412	
   413		Let me make a final plea, however, and that is to our intellec-
   414	tual patrons and financial supporters:  _The common aspirations 
   415	among the researchers and developers in our field, which can lead to 
   416	much good for humanity, must be protected from those without 
   417	vision._  The temptation to use virtual worlds technology for pur-
   418	poses that are trivial, base, or dangerous may prove overwhelming 
   419	for those who seek only material gain.  We who labor in the field are 
   420	generally without great resources, either within our organizations 
   421	or without, and we are susceptible to the influence money wields.  
   422	For too many in our field, daily life is simply a matter of trying to 
   423	survive.  That is not a healthy environment for a progressive indus-
   424	try.  If you want us to deliver on the promises we have made -- to 
   425	enhance education, improve health care, make design and manufac-
   426	turing more successful, and convert deadening entertainment into an 
   427	edifying experience -- then provide us with the support we need to 
   428	stay focused on what is important rather than what is expedient.  As 
   429	we say in America, help us to "do well by doing good."
   430	
   431		It is a positive irony that the virtual worlds we create may 
   432	become a medium for greater international understanding and pro-
   433	gress in the real world.  That has been my experience so far.  I am 
   434	proud to be a member of our community.
   435	
   436		Please permit me to close with a _koan_ for our times:
   437	
   438			A Master and student were walking down a dusty,
   439		virtual road, in search of Enlightenment.
   440	
   441			Eventually they came to a fork in the road, for 
   442		which there were no signposts.
   443	
   444			The student turned to the teacher and asked, 
   445		"Master, which way shall we proceed, to find 
   446		Enlightenment?"
   447	
   448			To which the Master, in reply, merely smiled, 
   449		reached down, and pulled the plug.
