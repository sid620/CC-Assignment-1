    13	     I feel that this dictionary fills a major void.  In my years 
    14	of using BBS's, I have never seen such a dictionary.  The closest 
    15	thing I've seen was a text file that had about 40 words listed.  
    16	These words included "RAM" "ROM" "Microcomputer" "Telex" and a 
    17	bunch of other words that aren't really that important to under-
    18	stand computer telecommunications.  I've seen some books about 
    19	"modeming" in bookstores, but they tend to be expensive ($15-
    20	$49), and I don't recall seeing any dictionaries of terms relat-
    21	ing to modems.  Also, many terms are easy to confuse and it can 
    22	be very difficult to find definitions for these terms.  I have 
    23	seen terms used incorrectly in advertisements by modem manufac-
    24	turers and in many magazine articles.  I hope that this diction-
    25	ary can be used as a good source of reference for confusing 
    26	terms.
    27	
    28	     Why do I feel qualified to write a dictionary such as this?  
    29	I bought my first modem more than seven years ago and have been 
    30	using computers for twice as long.  Not only have I used many 
    31	different computers and modems, I have seen the days where 
    32	1200bps BBS's were rare because most people had 300bps modems.  
    33	For about a year I ran my own BBS, which was quite successful at 
    34	the time.  While I only had about 150K of storage for messages 
    35	and files, I was able to get over 500 users in that year.  I have 
    36	also gathered, read, and searched through hundreds of text files, 
    37	magazines, and program documentation, just to help define words 
    38	and find new words for this dictionary.  I have also spoken to 
    39	representatives of major companies to help find out the truth 
    40	behind the more confusing terms.

    48	The author and/or distributor will not be liable for any conse-
    49	quences resulting from the use of this information.  This is a

    56	                              NOTES
    57	
    58	
    59	Note 1:  It was difficult to decide what words to include and 
    60	what words not to include.  I tried to include every term relat-
    61	ing to computer telecommunications that the average user needs to 
    62	know, or might come across and be curious about.  Some words 
    63	(such as PSK) are easily found in manuals for modems, but are 
    64	hard to find definitions for.  I tried to include as many of 
    65	these as possible.
    66	
    67	Note 2:  Since there are so many words defined here, and many of 
    68	them are complex and easily misunderstood, I wouldn't be sur-
    69	prised if there are a couple errors of some sort.  I tried to be 
    70	as careful as I could, but it is possible that there may be some 
    71	mistakes.  If you notice any mistakes, or have suggestions of 
    72	words to add (or take out), feel free to write to me.  I'll 
    73	correct any mistakes in future versions.

   104	
   105	
   106	     I've obviously put in countless hours over the past 4 years 
   107	creating this dictionary.  Just searching through new articles 
   108	and information to find new words takes hours.
   109	
   110	     As mentioned above, this dictionary is being marketed as 
   111	freeware.  Feel free to use it as much as you want.  If you find 
   112	that you are benefiting from it, I'd appreciate something.  A 
   113	letter of thanks or some input would be very welcome.
   114	
   115	     I'd love to hear how you are using this dictionary.  Since 
   116	its first release in 1989, the dictionary has been used:  in 
   117	training courses run by modem manufacturers; as a reference for 
   118	term papers for school; as a reference for an article for a Bar 
   119	Association; by SysOps for new user messages; and more.

   137	Hopefully, at some point there will be a BBS to call to get the 
   138	latest version of the Telecommunications Dictionary, as well as 
   139	to use as an easy way to contact me.  Until then, you can get
   140	the latest version from Computerized Horizons.  You can write
   141	to them at 2490 Black Rock Turnpike #309, Fairfield, CT 06430.

   149	                     Notes about the entries
   150	                     ----- ----- --- -------
   151	
   152	* [Also called <entry>] and [Same as <entry>] mean that there are 
   153	more than one word for a certain concept.  Do not bother looking 
   154	at <entry>, it will just refer you back to the original entry.
   155	
   156	* [See also <entry>] at the end of a definition refers you to 
   157	more information or an entry that may help you understand the 
   158	original entry better.  Also, a word and it's opposite will often 
   159	refer to each another.
   160	
   161	* [See <entry>] appearing directly after the term indicates that 
   162	the definition is the same as <entry>, and you should look there.
   163	
   164	* BBS is used here generically to denote any service that you can 
   165	call up with your computer, whether it is a bulletin board, a pay 
   166	service, or even a mainframe.
   167	
   168	* Some entries refer to computers in general, but an understand-
   169	ing of them is sometimes needed to understand other entries.

   180	
   181	---Numbers---
   182	
   183	
   184	
   185	8N1 - The most common modem format.  [See also format].
   186	
   187	42A Block - This is a box about two inches square, with a modular 
   188	jack, that separates the wires coming from the phone company.  
   189	You can plug a phone or modem into this jacking, using a modular 
   190	cord.  [See also modular cord, modular jack, modular plug].
   191	
   192	103 - Officially, `Bell 103' which is the standard controlling
   193	transmission at 300 bps in the United States.  It was created by
   194	AT&T.  [See also 212A, V.21].
   195	
   196	212A - Officially, `Bell 212A' which is the standard controlling 
   197	transmission at 1200 bps in the United States.  It was created by 
   198	AT&T.  [See also 103, V.22].
   199	
   200	300 bps (baud) - A transmission speed that is now almost never 
   201	used, although most modems will allow communication at the speed 
   202	(since it was common in the early 1980's).  It is roughly equal 
   203	to 30 characters per second.
   204	
   205	1200 bps (baud) - In the mid 1980s this was the most common 
   206	transmission speed, until 2400 bps became popular/cheaper.  It is 
   207	roughly equal to 120 characters per second.
   208	
   209	2400 bps (baud) - A fairly high-speed transmission speed that 
   210	towards the end of the 1980s gained popularity.  It is roughly 
   211	equal to 240 characters per second.
   212	
   213	3400 hertz - The highest pitch that a telephone line will trans-
   214	mit.  This cutoff limits the ways in which computers can communi-
   215	cate over telephone lines.
   216	
   217	8250 UART - The UART used for the communications ports on most 
   218	older computers.  [See also UART].
   219	
   220	9600 bps (baud) - This, along with 14,400 bps are the 2 standard 
   221	speeds for high-speed modems.  It can transmit and receive ap-
   222	proximately 960 characters per second (without compression).
   223	
   224	14400 bps - Currently, the fastest standard speed for high-speed 
   225	modems.
   226	
   227	16450 UART - The UART used with some 286 computers.  [See also 
   228	UART].
   229	
   230	16550 UART - This is the UART used with most newer computers and 
   231	high speed modems.  There are several variations, but they all 
   232	include one main feature: they include buffering, so that if data 
   233	comes in or is sent faster than the computer/modem can accept it, 
   234	the UART will hold the data (up to 16 bytes) until the 
   235	computer/modem is ready for it.  [See also UART].
   236	
   237	16550A UART - See 16550 UART.
   238	
   239	16550AF UART - See 16550 UART.
   240	
   241	16550AFN UART - See 16550 UART.

   246	
   247	
   248	
   249	abort - [1] The command word used with editors that allows you to 
   250	exit, destroying your message.  [2] The character used to stop 
   251	characters from a block of text appearing on your screen.  Usual-
   252	ly the spacebar or CTRL-X are used to abort a message.
   253	
   254	access - Refers to an intangible amount (usually represented by a 
   255	security level or flags) that indicate to what extent you are 
   256	allowed to use a BBS.  When used in a term such as `you will be 
   257	granted access', it means the amount of access that new users 
   258	will generally receive.
   259	
   260	account - A term that refers to information that a BBS has about 
   261	you.  It is usually referred to by an ID number or your name.  
   262	The information it contains can include any information that you 
   263	have at some point given the BBS, usually including your name, 
   264	phone number, and security level.  [See also user number].
   265	
   266	account number - See user number.
   267	
   268	Acculink - A packet switched network that is used to save money 
   269	on long-distance telecommunications.
   270	
   271	ACK - A character (CTRL-F) that ACKnowledges something, usually 
   272	that a certain amount of data has been received correctly.  [See 
   273	also NAK].
   274	
   275	acoustic coupler - This was common many years ago, but rare now.  
   276	It is a cradle in which you would place the handset of a phone.  
   277	This would be connected to a modem, and the modem would access 
   278	the phone line through this coupler.  Modern modems connect 
   279	directly to the phone line.  [See also acoustic modem].
   280	
   281	acoustic modem - A modem that uses an acoustic coupler.  [See
   282	also acoustic coupler].
   283	
   284	adaptive data compression - See ADC.
   285	
   286	adaptive dialing - When a modem can determine whether to dial
   287	pulse or tone.  It will try dialing with tones first.  If that
   288	doesn't work, it will dial pulse.
   289	
   290	adaptive equalization - Modems that have this feature "listen" to 
   291	the phone line to find the bandwidth with the least noise, and 
   292	use that part of the band for transmission.  This allows for less 
   293	interference from noise.
   294	
   295	ADC - Adaptive Data Compression.  A method of data compression
   296	developed by Hayes, with a possible compression ratio of 2:1.
   297	
   298	alias - A name that users can use on a bulletin board that is not 
   299	their own.  Aliases are usually used by young BBS users and those 
   300	who pirate software or do other illegal activities.  Some exam-
   301	ples of aliases are `Cracker Kid', `Starbuck', and `Midnight 
   302	Killer'.  [Also called handle].  [See also user name].
   303	
   304	ampersand - A character (&) that usually means `and'.
   305	
   306	analog - As far as electronic signals are concerned, analog 
   307	refers to signals that can represent an infinite range of num-
   308	bers, as opposed to digital which can only be distinct whole 
   309	numbers.  Analog data often comes from measurements.  The sound a 
   310	modem makes over the phone is analog since it can be any of a 
   311	number of different frequencies.  [See also digital].
   312	
   313	anonymous - Refers to a message, where the author was able to 
   314	leave out his name.  On some BBS's you are allowed to post anony-
   315	mous messages so that others won't know who you are.  The SysOp 
   316	usually can find out who the author is, however.
   317	
   318	ANSI - ANSI is an organization that sets standards.  ANSI graph-
   319	ics, however, is a set of cursor control codes which originated 
   320	on the VT100 smart terminal.  Many BBS's use these codes to help 
   321	improve the sending of characters to communications programs.  It 
   322	uses the escape character, followed by other characters, which 
   323	allows movement of the cursor on the screen, a change of color, 
   324	and more.
   325	
   326	answering computer - This is the computer that is being called.  
   327	Therefore, it is usually the BBS or mainframe. [See also origi-
   328	nating computer].
   329	
   330	answering machine - See voice mail.
   331	
   332	answer frequency - The frequency of the carrier that a modem uses 
   333	when it has been called by another computer.  [See also originate 
   334	frequency].
   335	
   336	answer mode - When a modem is ready to pick up the phone when it 
   337	rings.  After picking up the phone, the modem will attempt to 
   338	make a connection with another modem.  All BBS's are in answer 
   339	mode.  [See also originate mode].
   340	
   341	apostrophe - The character '.  It is usually used in contractions
   342	of words, such as "don't".
   343	
   344	ARC - When a filename has the extension ARC, it means that it is 
   345	an archive that has been compressed with the program PKARC.  To 
   346	get the files out of the archive, you need to use the program 
   347	PKXARC.  You should be able to find this program on many BBS's.  
   348	[See also archive, unarchive].
   349	
   350	archive - [noun] A group of programs that are together, usually 
   351	compressed, in one file.  [verb] the process of combining those 
   352	files.  There are a number of software packages which will com-
   353	press files into an archive, and most programs on BBS's have been 
   354	archived with one of these software packages.  [See also unar-
   355	chive, compress, ZIP, ARJ, ARC, PAK, LZH].
   356	
   357	area code - The 3-digit number used by the telephone company to 
   358	designate a geographic area.  Each state in the United States has 
   359	1 or more area codes.  If you call a phone number in a different 
   360	area code, you must dial "1" and then the area code before the 
   361	phone number.  If you call a number within your area code, you 
   362	just dial the phone number (if it is long distance within your 
   363	area code, you must dial "1" and then the number).
   364	
   365	ARJ - [1] A file extension that indicates that the file was com-
   366	pressed with the program ARJ.  [2] The program ARJ, used to 
   367	archive and un-archive files with the ARJ extension.  [See also 
   368	archive, unarchive].
   369	
   370	ASCII - An acronym for American Standard Code of Information 
   371	Interchange.  It uses 7 bits to represent all uppercase and 
   372	lowercase characters, as well as numbers, punctuation marks, and 
   373	other characters.  ASCII often uses 8 bits in the form of bytes 
   374	and ignores the first bit.  [See also EBCDIC].
   375	
   376	ASCII transfer - When a text file is sent directly as it is, 
   377	without any special codes.
   378	
   379	asterisk - The character *.
   380	
   381	asynchronous communication - This is when the beginning and end
   382	of each byte that is sent over the phone lines is marked somehow.
   383	This way, if there is line noise, the modem can find out right
   384	away where the next byte should start.  [See also synchronous
   385	communication].
   386	
   387	AT command - Any instructions sent to a modem that begin with 
   388	"AT".  See also Hayes AT command set.
   389	
   390	AT command set - See Hayes AT command set.
   391	
   392	at sign - The character @.  Often read as 'at'.
   393	
   394	AT&T - American Telephone and Telegraph, the inventors of the 
   395	first modem.
   396	
   397	attended mode - This is the mode that a communications program is 
   398	in while you are operating it.  [See also unattended mode].
   399	
   400	attention characters - The letters "AT", which get the modem's 
   401	attention that you are about to send it a command.  [See also 
   402	Hayes AT command set].
   403	
   404	audio monitor - A speaker that is included as part of a modem.  
   405	It allows you to listen to whatever sound is on the phone line.  
   406	This is often used to let you hear busy signals or make sure that 
   407	the other modem picks up the carrier.
   408	
   409	auto-answer - When a modem has the ability to automatically pick 
   410	up the phone when the phone rings and then attempt to connect 
   411	with another computer.
   412	
   413	auto-answer LED - When this LED (found on some external modems) 
   414	lights up, it means that the modem is ready to answer the phone 
   415	when the phone rings (it will then try to connect to another 
   416	modem).  If it is not lit, the modem will not answer the phone.  
   417	[See also LED indicators].
   418	
   419	auto-baud detect - The ability of a modem to change to a lower 
   420	bps rate if the computer it is calling is unable to communicate 
   421	at the requested speed.
   422	
   423	auto-dial - When a modem is capable of dialing a phone number, so 
   424	that you don't have to dial manually.  Almost all modems have 
   425	this ability.
   426	
   427	auto-download - The feature of some file transfer protocols 
   428	whereby a BBS can automatically make your communications program 
   429	start a download or upload (if your communications program has 
   430	this capability too).  This saves some time for the user, who 
   431	would otherwise have to set up his program to upload or download.
   432	
   433	auto fall-back - See fall-back.
   434	
   435	auto-kill - A feature on some BBS's that will delete a message on
   436	a board if a certain threshold limit is reached.  For example, a
   437	BBS might delete the second message on a board if there are
   438	already 100 messages and someone posts another message.  This 
   439	would limit the board to 100 messages, but still keep the first 
   440	message (which is usually left by the SysOp).
   441	
   442	auto-redial - A feature that allows a modem or a communications 
   443	program to dial a number again after it finds out that the number 
   444	is busy.  This is very handy when trying to get through to popu-
   445	lar bulletin boards that are often busy.
   446	
   447	auto-reliable - The ability of a modem to be able to communicate 
   448	both with modems that do have error-control and/or data compres-
   449	sion, and those that do not.
   450	
   451	auto-reply - To send a message (either public or private) immedi-
   452	ately after reading a message on a BBS.  Usually, this is used to 
   453	respond to the author of the original message.
   454	
   455	auto-syncing driver - This is the part of a BBS program that 
   456	automatically determines the bps rate of a caller.  [See also 
   457	manual-syncing driver].
   458	
   459	auto-typing - This is when a communications program can upload 
   460	information to a BBS as if the user were typing in the informa-
   461	tion.  For example, the user might type a message into a file, 
   462	and then the communications program can send it to a BBS (which 
   463	assumes the user is actually typing the message) to post as a 
   464	message.
   465	
   466	
   467	
   468	---B---
   469	
   470	
   471	
   472	backdoor - A way of getting into certain BBS's and getting full 
   473	access, without using a regular account.  Usually the author of 
   474	the BBS program built the backdoor into the program so that he 
   475	could get access to any BBS running his software.  Backdoors are 
   476	less common today than they used to be.
   477	
   478	background send/receive - The ability of a fax/modem to send or 
   479	receive faxes while the computer is being used for other pur-
   480	poses.
   481	
   482	backslash - The character \.
   483	
   484	backspace - The character (CTRL-H) that causes the cursor on your
   485	screen to move back one space.  [See also destructive backspace,
   486	non-destructive backspace].
   487	
   488	bandwidth - A range of radio, audio, or other frequencies.  
   489	Telephone lines have a bandwidth from 300 hertz to 3400 hertz.  
   490	Since it is so limited, a modem must carefully change data into 
   491	sounds that "fit" within this range.  Similar to frequency spec-
   492	trum.
   493	
   494	bannerware - A software program that is free to use and copy, but 
   495	advertises another program or product.  [See also public domain].
   496	
   497	batch file transfer - This is when more than one file is sent at 
   498	a time by a file transfer protocol.  The user will tell the BBS 
   499	what files he wants, and then the BBS will send all the files 
   500	before the user needs to do anything else.
   501	
   502	baud - A term referring to the speed at which modems communicate.  
   503	Technically, it is the number of changes in an electronic signal 
   504	per second.  Since the number of changes used to be the same as 
   505	the number of bits sent or received per second, bps and baud are 
   506	often used interchangeably.  However, there is a difference, 
   507	which is very often confused.  For example, many 1200bps modems 
   508	were advertised as 1200 baud, even though they operate at 600 
   509	baud.  They send out 2 bits 600 times a second, which means that 
   510	it is 600 baud.  However, since it is so often misunderstood, you 
   511	can assume that when you see "baud" it means bits per second, 
   512	unless it is stated otherwise.  The term comes from the scientist 
   513	J. M. E. Baudot.  [See also bps, dibit].
   514	
   515	BBS - An acronym for Bulletin Board System.  Usually it is a home 
   516	computer that has a modem attached and is waiting for calls from 
   517	other computers.  It can, however, also refer to commercial serv-
   518	ices (such as CompuServe and Prodigy) and any other computers 
   519	that you can call via telephone lines. BBS's almost always allow 
   520	you to leave messages for other users.  Most BBS's have programs 
   521	that you can download and use on your computer.  BBS can also be 
   522	expanded more simply to `bulletin board'.
   523	
   524	BCC - Block Check Character.  This is used to help make sure that 
   525	a group of data has not been accidentally altered.
   526	
   527	Bell 103 - See 103.
   528	
   529	Bell 212A - See 212A.
   530	
   531	bisync - Refers to a modem that synchronizes with an electronic 
   532	signal over the telephone lines that marks the beginning of 
   533	blocks of data.  It is one of a number of synchronous protocols.
   534	
   535	bit - A Binary digIT.  It is a number in base 2 (binary), which 
   536	means that it can only be a 0 or a 1.  It is used in the expres-
   537	sion `bits per second'.  [See also byte].
   538	
   539	bitstream - BBS's and related activities.  For example, you could 
   540	say that a lot of public domain programs can be found in the 
   541	bitstream.
   542	
   543	blind dial - This is when a modem will dial a number without 
   544	waiting for a dial tone.  Some long-distance telephone services 
   545	require a number to be dialed, even though there is no dial tone.  
   546	In this case, your modem should be set to blind dial.
   547	
   548	block - A group of data bytes.  For example, when downloading a 
   549	program, blocks of 128 or 1024 characters are often sent.
   550	
   551	block check character - See BCC.
   552	
   553	block size - This term, when used with either error control or 
   554	data compression protocols, refers to the number of characters to 
   555	be sent at one time.  If error control is used, the codes are 
   556	sent immediately following this block.  Typical block sizes are 
   557	64, 128, 192, or 256 characters.  Small block sizes are better 
   558	when the line quality is bad (such as for long distance calls), 
   559	while large block sizes are better during good connections (such 
   560	as for local calls).
   561	
   562	board - [1] See BBS.  [2] See message base.
   563	
   564	bps - Bits Per Second.  The transmission speed of most modems is 
   565	measured in baud or bps.  Bps is literally the number of bits 
   566	sent by the modem every second.  [See also baud].
   567	
   568	braces - The characters { and }.  [See also left brace, right 
   569	brace].
   570	
   571	brackets - The characters [ and ].  [See also left bracket, right 
   572	bracket].
   573	
   574	break signal - This is a signal sent from one modem to another 
   575	that lasts for about a second.  It is sometimes used to try to 
   576	clear up synchronization problems.  On CCITT V.42 modems, there 
   577	are more specialized procedures involved with the break signal, 
   578	such as regarding the timing.  In V.42 there are three kinds of 
   579	break signals.  [See also expedited signaling, destructive sig-
   580	naling, in sequence signaling].
   581	
   582	browse - To go through the list of titles of messages or files on 
   583	a BBS and note which ones you want to read.
   584	
   585	buffer - [1] (verb) To save all incoming data in memory.  [2] 
   586	(verb) to temporarily save incoming data until the computer has a 
   587	chance to process it.  [3] (noun) The place in memory where the 
   588	saved information is stored, as in "I have a 32K buffer."
   589	
   590	bulk mailing - Used on a BBS when you send the same message to 
   591	more than one person.  This saves you from having to rewrite the 
   592	message.  [See also E-mail].
   593	
   594	bulletin - A special message posted on a BBS, usually written by 
   595	the SysOp.  In most cases all users are expected to read any new 
   596	bulletins that may have been posted since their last call.
   597	
   598	bulletin board - [1] See BBS. [2] Sometimes same as message base.
   599	
   600	bulletin board system - See BBS.
   601	
   602	busy - When a bulletin board is being used by as many users as it 
   603	can handle, which is when all the telephone lines are being used.
   604	
   605	busy signal - The sound that you hear on a phone when the phone 
   606	number you are trying to reach is in use (busy).  It usually 
   607	consists of 60 cycles per minute.  [See also audio monitor].
   608	
   609	byte - A group of 8 bits.  It usually represents one character.
   610	[See also ASCII].
   611	
   612	
   613	
   614	---C---
   615	
   616	
   617	
   618	call back unit - A device that can be attached to the phone line 
   619	of a BBS to make it more secure.  After you connect with the BBS 
   620	and tell it who you are, the device will then call your phone 
   621	number.  This is used to make a very secure system to help pre-
   622	vent hackers from invading a system.  It then becomes very diffi-
   623	cult, if not impossible, for a hacker to get into the computer 
   624	system.
   625	
   626	caller - Anyone who connects with a BBS.  It is usually used in a 
   627	phrase such as "You are caller #4328."
   628	
   629	caller I.D. - A code that is sent over the phone lines in some 
   630	areas when a person makes a phone call.  This code includes the 
   631	phone number of the person making the call.  Some modems are able 
   632	to understand this signal, and let you know who is calling you 
   633	before you answer the phone.
   634	
   635	caller log - A list of callers who have called a BBS within a 
   636	given time period.  The list may also keep information such as 
   637	the bps rate of the caller.  This is used so that the SysOp can 
   638	keep track of users, as well as any hackers, if they call the 
   639	BBS.
   640	
   641	call progress monitoring - This is when your modem tells you what 
   642	is happening when you dial another computer.  It will tell you 
   643	that it has dialed the number, if the number is busy, if you 
   644	connect, etc.
   645	
   646	call waiting - A service that the phone company offers that 
   647	allows the customer to hear a special sound on the phone if there 
   648	is an incoming call while the customer is talking on the phone.  
   649	The customer can then talk with either caller.  This is a nice 
   650	service unless you have a modem and call BBS's.  If you are 
   651	connected with a BBS and someone else calls you, you will be 
   652	disconnected.  In most areas there is a special 2 or 3 digit 
   653	number that you can dial before a phone call that will disconnect 
   654	call waiting for that call.  If you have call waiting, check your 
   655	phonebook or call the phone company to find out how to disconnect 
   656	call waiting.
   657	
   658	capital letters - See uppercase.
   659	
   660	capture - To 'catch' text that is being sent to your computer 
   661	from a BBS and put it in a buffer or a file.
   662	
   663	capture buffer - The area in a computer's memory where a communi-
   664	cations program stores incoming data that is to be saved.  [Also 
   665	called capture memory].  [See also buffer].
   666	
   667	capture memory - See capture buffer.
   668	
   669	card (peripheral) - Any computer peripheral that can be connected 
   670	directly, inside a computer.  Internal modems are usually periph-
   671	eral cards.
   672	
   673	caret - The character ^.
   674	
   675	carriage return - See return.
   676	
   677	carrier - The tone that the modem sends over the phone lines 
   678	before any data is sent on it.  It has a fixed frequency and a 
   679	fixed amplitude.  It is then modified to indicate data.
   680	
   681	carrier detect - The wire in an RS-232C cable that holds the 
   682	information as to whether or not the modem senses a carrier (and 
   683	therefore is connected to another computer).  [Also called CD].
   684	
   685	carrier detect threshold - A way of measuring how well a modem
   686	can detect valid data over noisy phone lines.  It is measured in
   687	negative dBm's (decibel-milliwatts).  The bigger the number (the
   688	more negative) the better.  For example, -45 dBm is better than
   689	-40 dBm.  [Same as receive sensitivity].
   690	
   691	carrier detect LED - This LED will light up on an external modem 
   692	when it senses a carrier on the phone line.  This indicates that 
   693	the modem is connected to another modem.  [See also LED indica-
   694	tors].
   695	
   696	carrier frequency - This is the frequency which a modem uses to
   697	transmit or receive data.
   698	
   699	carrier loss time - The amount of time your modem will remain on 
   700	the line when the carrier is lost.  It will stay on the line for 
   701	this amount of time, to see if the carrier comes back.  If the 
   702	carrier does not come back, the modem will hang up the phone 
   703	line.
   704	
   705	CB simulator - A computer service where there are multiple phone 
   706	lines (usually at least 5).  The CB simulator allows all the 
   707	users to send messages to one another while they are on-line.  It 
   708	usually allows you to send both public messages that everyone who 
   709	is on-line can see and private messages that only one specific 
   710	user can see.
   711	
   712	CCITT - International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Com-
   713	mittee.  This group, created by the United Nations, establishes 
   714	certain standards for data transmission.  Their transmission, 
   715	data compression, and error control standards all begin with V, 
   716	for example V.22.  To find the standards in this dictionary, look 
   717	up the standard name, i.e. V.42.
   718	
   719	CD - See carrier detect.
   720	
   721	character - Any letter, numeral or symbol.  [See also ASCII].
   722	
   723	character format - See format.
   724	
   725	characters per second - The number of bytes or characters that 
   726	can be sent over the phone lines in 1 second.  This is determined 
   727	by dividing the bps rate by the number of bits it takes to send 
   728	one byte (usually 10--the start bit, 8 bits of data, and the stop 
   729	bit).  So, a 2400bps modem can send 240 characters per second 
   730	(2400/10).  [Same as CPS].
   731	
   732	chat - A mode that allows two or more people (almost always a 
   733	SysOp and a user on a BBS) to communicate directly with each 
   734	other using the modem.  Usually, each person can see what the 
   735	other is typing at all times and can interrupt them (a beeping 
   736	sound with a CTRL-G is useful to interrupt with).  [See also page 
   737	(verb)].
   738	
   739	chat mode - This is when a communications program is set up so 
   740	that the user can "chat" with someone on the other end of the 
   741	line.  One way this can work is that anything that is typed by 
   742	the other person is printed on the top half of the screen, but 
   743	anything you type would appear on the bottom half of the screen.  
   744	[See also chat].
   745	
   746	checksum - A number that represents a larger group of numbers in 
   747	order to check for errors in data transmission.  It is commonly 
   748	used when downloading a program, as well as in error control 
   749	protocols.  The checksum is the result of a mathematical equa-
   750	tion, such as adding all the numbers in a block together (al-
   751	though it is usually more complex than that).
   752	
   753	chip set - A group of important IC chips on a modem (or other 
   754	computer peripheral) that are all made by the same manufacturer.  
   755	While there are many companies that make modems, there are only a 
   756	few that make the chips for them.  Because the chip manufacturer 
   757	is making the chips for many companies, they produce more chips, 
   758	and the price of the chips is lower than if each company produced 
   759	their own.  This decreases the price of the modems on the market.
   760	
   761	Christensen protocol - See Xmodem.
   762	
   763	circular dialing queue - This is used in some communications 
   764	programs to allow you to enter a list of phone numbers to call, 
   765	and it will keep going through the list and dialing numbers until 
   766	it reaches one of them.  This is useful if you are trying to 
   767	reach BBS's that are often busy.
   768	
   769	city code - With many foreign countries, you need to dial a city 
   770	code before the phone number you are trying to reach.  You must 
   771	dial the country code before the city code.  The city code will 
   772	be from 1 to 5 digits.  [See also country code].
   773	
   774	clear to send - See CTS.
   775	
   776	columns - A measurement of the width of your screen as measured 
   777	by the number of characters your screen can fit across it.  BBS's 
   778	often ask for your screen width.  Most computers have a screen 
   779	width of 80 columns.
   780	
   781	COM port - IBM and compatible computers have the ability to hook  
   782	up devices (such as modems and mice) to the computer, through 
   783	ports.  These ports are called COM ports, and are numbered 1-8.  
   784	While all 8 could be used, usually only #1 and #2 are used, while 
   785	#3 and #4 are used occasionally.  [See also selectable COM port].
   786	
   787	comm program - See communications program.
   788	
   789	command buffer - The place in your modem's memory where it stores 
   790	the commands that you give it.  [See also buffer].
   791	
   792	command echo - When this is on, any AT command sent to the modem 
   793	will then be sent back from the modem to the computer.  For 
   794	example, if you were to type "ATS11=40," the modem would act on 
   795	the command, and then send "ATS11=40" back to the computer.
   796	
   797	command mode - This is when your modem interprets what you type 
   798	as commands, rather than just sending the data over the phone 
   799	line.  [See also data mode, terminal mode, voice mode].
   800	
   801	command set - A list of all the possible commands that you can 
   802	give something, such as a modem, a BASIC program, or a BBS.  [See 
   803	also Hayes AT command set].
   804	
   805	commands - Instructions that you can give to a modem, a BBS, or 
   806	another similar device.
   807	
   808	commercial host system - An on-line system that you can call up, 
   809	that is operated by a company that charges you to use it.
   810	
   811	commercial software - Software that is copyrighted and may not 
   812	legally be distributed by BBS's or copied and given to other 
   813	users.  [See also public domain, copyright].
   814	
   815	communication - The idea of transferring one's thoughts or ideas 
   816	to another person.  This can be through speaking, radio, T.V., 
   817	telephones, mail, etc.
   818	
   819	communications program - A program that controls a modem, and has 
   820	features that allow the user to do such things as upload, down-
   821	load, etc.  It is similar to a terminal program but more sophis-
   822	ticated.  It used to be used interchangeably with terminal pro-
   823	gram.  [Same as comm program].
   824	
   825	compatible - When one object can work just like another.  Al-
   826	though the term is usually used with computers, it is often used 
   827	with modems.  Many modems are compatible with other popular 
   828	modems.  [See also V.42 compatible].
   829	
   830	compliant - See V.42 compliant.
   831	
   832	compress - To make data take up less space.  Archiving programs 
   833	do this, which means that files will take less time to transfer 
   834	with modems.  Many modems now have the ability to automatically 
   835	compress the information they send and receive.  [See also ar-
   836	chive, data compression].
   837	
   838	compression ratio - The ratio of the original size of data that 
   839	is sent to the compressed size.  For example, a 3:1 compression 
   840	ratio means that the original data takes up 3 times the amount of 
   841	space as the compressed data, and a modem would transfer the data 
   842	3 times more quickly than if it was not compressed.
   843	
   844	computer network - See LAN.
   845	
   846	configure - To set something to your liking.  To configure a BBS, 
   847	you may have to tell it your screen width, whether you need line 
   848	feeds and other such information.
   849	
   850	configuration - Configuration is the information describing what 
   851	your computer's hardware and software is like, so that a BBS can 
   852	send information properly.  For example, you need to tell a BBS 
   853	how wide your screen is.
   854	
   855	connect - [1] To get to a point where you can start communicating 
   856	with a BBS, as in "I have connected with the BBS."  [2] Any point 
   857	after you have established contact with a BBS, as in "I am still 
   858	connected with the BBS" or "I have been connected with the bulle-
   859	tin board for just over an hour."
   860	
   861	connect speed - The speed, in bps, which your modem uses when it 
   862	connects with a BBS.  This speed will depend on the speed of your 
   863	modem, and the BBS's modem.  It will be no higher than the lower 
   864	of the two speeds.  If you have a 2400bps modem, and call a 
   865	1200bps BBS, your connect speed should be 1200bps.
   866	
   867	connection - The actual contact with a BBS.  It is used most 
   868	often in expressions such as "I have a bad connection," meaning 
   869	that there is line noise.
   870	
   871	control character - Any of the 32 ASCII characters that do not 
   872	print on your screen or printer.  These characters are usually 
   873	used to control your computer.  [See also CTRL].
   874	
   875	copyright - A term meaning that a program or text file is pro-
   876	tected by the government so that it may not legally be copied, 
   877	except to make backup copies, or as specified by the author of 
   878	the program.  You should not upload a copyrighted program to a 
   879	BBS, unless it is shareware or freeware.  [See shareware, free-
   880	ware].
   881	
   882	Co-SysOp - A term similar to a vice president.  The Co-SysOp of a 
   883	BBS has more access to the BBS than any other user except the 
   884	SysOp.  The Co-SysOp might check messages to make sure that they 
   885	are suitable for the BBS (not containing illegal messages), and 
   886	he may be able to validate users.  Sometimes a Co-SysOp is just a 
   887	title given to someone who helped the BBS a lot by doing things 
   888	such as posting messages and uploading.  Also, many times there 
   889	is more than one Co-SysOp.  [See also SysOp].
   890	
   891	country code - The code that the telephone company uses to desig-
   892	nate a certain country.  If you need to call a BBS (or a person) 
   893	in a foreign country, you need to dial the country code, then 
   894	usually the city code, and then the local phone number.  The 
   895	country code will be 2 to 3 digits.  [See also city code].
   896	
   897	CPS - See characters per second.
   898	
   899	<CR> - Carriage Return.  See return.
   900	
   901	CRC - Stands for Cyclic Redundancy Check.  CRC is a system to 
   902	make sure that a block of data (usually from a downloaded pro-
   903	gram) is as free from error as possible.  It is usually 16 or 32 
   904	bits long (CRC-16 and CRC-32 respectively).
   905	
   906	crash - When a BBS is harmed in such a way that it is temporarily 
   907	inoperable.  The usual cause is that some files are destroyed, 
   908	either by accident or by a hacker.  Some people try to crash 
   909	BBS's, a fact that most users (and especially SysOps) think is 
   910	sad.
   911	
   912	crash recovery - This feature of some file transfer protocols 
   913	allows a user to continue a download or upload that had been 
   914	interrupted.  With this system, a user will not have to receive 
   915	the data that had already been sent before the disconnection, 
   916	which will save time.
   917	
   918	crippleware - This is software, usually distributed as shareware,
   919	but it is not a complete program.  If it is a game, it might only
   920	let you play the first level.  If it is a database program, it
   921	might only let you have 50 entries (whereas the real version
   922	would have more).
   923	
   924	CRT - Cathode Ray Tube.  This is another name for a computer 
   925	monitor.
   926	
   927	CTRL - The abbreviation for ConTRoL.  This abbreviation is fol-
   928	lowed by a dash and then a character, such as CTRL-C, meaning the 
   929	control character C.  [See also control character].
   930	
   931	CTRL-G - The control character G, which usually causes the com-
   932	puter to produce a beeping sound.
   933	
   934	CTS - Clear To Send.  This is when the modem lets the other 
   935	computer know that it can send information to the other computer. 
   936	[See also flow control, RTS].
   937	
   938	CTS/RTS - The method of flow control that uses the CTS and RTS 
   939	signals.  It is built into the hardware, not software.  [See also 
   940	CTS, RTS, flow control].
   941	
   942	cursor - The marker that points out where text will next appear 
   943	on your screen.  It can be one of many things, usually a plain 
   944	white or flashing square, or an underline character.
   945	
   946	cyclic redundancy check - See CRC.
   947	
   948	cycling - When a light (such as the RD light) on an external 
   949	modem continuously turns on and off.
   950	
   951	
   952

   954	
   955	
   956	
   957	dash - The character -.
   958	
   959	data - A group of characters that represents meaningful informa-
   960	tion.  This information can be anything, ranging from bank ac-
   961	count numbers to computer programs.  [See also information].
   962	
   963	database - [1] A program that keeps track of data, such as the 
   964	information contained on mailing labels, or the price of stocks.  
   965	[2] A large group of data.  The sum of the information that you 
   966	can receive on extensive pay services such as CompuServe can be 
   967	considered a database.
   968	
   969	database hack - A way that hackers attempt to gain access to 
   970	someone's account on a BBS.  They create a list of common pass-
   971	words (such as SECRET and MINE) and try every one on an account 
   972	to see if it is the right password.  Because of this, an intelli-
   973	gent BBS user will not use easy-to-guess passwords.
   974	
   975	data bits - [1] The number of bits that the modem uses to repre-
   976	sent one byte.  This is usually 8, though it can be 7 since ASCII 
   977	needs only 7 of the 8 bits.  [See also format].  [2] the actual 
   978	bits within a byte being sent through the phone lines.
   979	
   980	data byte - A byte of information that is being sent over the 
   981	phone lines.
   982	
   983	data carrier detect - See DCD.
   984	
   985	data communications equipment - See DCE.
   986	
   987	data compression - Some modems have the capability to 'squash' 
   988	data so that it takes up less space.  When another modem (that 
   989	also has this capability) receives the data, it 'unsquashes' the 
   990	data to its original form.  By using data compression, a modem 
   991	can send information faster.  It's a lot like shorthand--all the 
   992	information is still there, but it takes less space and is quick-
   993	er.  [See also MNP-5, V.42bis].
   994	
   995	data grade - A phone line that is set up by the phone company to
   996	be more convenient for data communications.  It should have 
   997	better electronic characteristics than a regular phone line.  
   998	[See also voice grade].
   999	
  1000	data mode - The mode that a modem is in where all information 
  1001	typed on the computer will be sent through the modem, and all 
  1002	information received by the modem will be placed on the screen.  
  1003	[See also command mode, terminal mode, voice mode].  [Same as 
  1004	on-line mode].
  1005	
  1006	data modem - A modem that does not have the ability to send or
  1007	receive fax transmissions.

  1020	example, data may be sent at 115,200bps.  [Same as transmission 
  1021	rate, transmission speed, data rate].  [See also bps].
  1022	
  1023	dB - See decibel.
  1024	
  1025	dBm - Decibel referred to one milliwatt.  This is used to measure 
  1026	certain levels, such as transmit level.  [See also transmit 
  1027	level, receive level, carrier detect threshold].
  1028	
  1029	DB-25 - The 25 pin plug that connects an RS-232C cable to the 
  1030	RS-232 port.
  1031	
  1032	DCD - Data Carrier Detect.  This tells the computer whether or 
  1033	not the modem is connected to another modem.
  1034	
  1035	DCE - Data Communications Equipment.  These are computer periph-
  1036	erals that communicate.  A modem is a DCE.  [See also DTE].
  1037	
  1038	decibel - A unit describing how loud one sound is compared to 
  1039	another.  [Same as dB].
  1040	
  1041	decompress - The process of converting compressed data back to 
  1042	its original form.  [See also archive].
  1043	
  1044	decoy program - A program or text sent on mainframes and multi-
  1045	line BBS's that simulates the log-on procedure.  The unsuspecting 
  1046	user will see this and enter his password, and the person who 
  1047	made the decoy program will get the password and can use the 
  1048	account.
  1049	
  1050	default - A setting or an answer to a question that is automati-
  1051	cally assumed.  If 80 columns is a default, then you only have to 
  1052	change it if you want something other than 80 columns.
  1053	
  1054	delay time - The time it takes between sending data on a computer 
  1055	and receiving a response from the remote computer.  If the delay 
  1056	is long, most file transfer protocols will slow down.  [See also 
  1057	protocol].
  1058	
  1059	demodulate - To convert the tones that a modem sends over the 
  1060	phone lines back into data.  [See also modulate].
  1061	
  1062	destructive backspace - A term that indicates that your communi-
  1063	cations program deletes the character the cursor is on when it 
  1064	receives the backspace character.  [See also non-destructive 
  1065	backspace].
  1066	
  1067	destructive signaling - This is a type of break signal that 
  1068	causes all data to be destroyed while the break signal is being 
  1069	sent.  [See also break signal].
  1070	
  1071	dial - To send out either the tones or pulses that the phone 
  1072	company needs to understand what number you are calling.  Most 
  1073	modems will dial automatically (auto-dial).
  1074	
  1075	dialing speed - See touchtone dialing speed.
  1076	
  1077	dialout facility - A service where you call a computer, and from 
  1078	that computer you can call other computers.  It is usually used 
  1079	with packet switching networks, which saves you money on long 
  1080	distance calls.
  1081	
  1082	dialup line - A telephone line connected to the telephone compa-
  1083	ny.  This is a regular phone line.  [Compare to leased line].
  1084	
  1085	dialup modem - A modem that is used over normal (dialup) tele-
  1086	phone lines.
  1087	
  1088	dial modifiers - Any commands that are sent to a modem which 
  1089	change the way a phone number is dialed.  For example: tone, 
  1090	pulse, and pause.
  1091	
  1092	dial tone - The sound that you hear when you pick up the phone if 
  1093	it is ready to have an outgoing call made.  Your modem, if it can 
  1094	dial, should understand this tone.
  1095	
  1096	dibit - Two bits sent simultaneously by a modem.  For example, a 
  1097	modem can operate at 1200bps and 600 baud.  What happens in this 
  1098	case is that 600 times a second, the modem sends out a dibit (two 
  1099	bits).  Therefore, it is sending 1200 (600 times 2) bits per 
  1100	second.  [See also bps, baud].
  1101	
  1102	dictionary - The V.42bis data compression protocol stores certain 
  1103	data that is being sent/received in a "dictionary," which it 
  1104	refers to when compressing/decompressing data.  [See also 
  1105	V.42bis, dictionary size].  [Same as encoder dictionary].
  1106	
  1107	dictionary size - This is the number of characters in the dic-
  1108	tionary used for the V.42bis data compression protocol.  It is 
  1109	usually 2048, but can also be 1024, 512, or 4096.  [See also 
  1110	dictionary, V.42bis].
  1111	
  1112	digital - A system using discrete numbers to represent data.  In 
  1113	computer systems, these are the numbers 0 and 1 (for binary).  
  1114	[See also analog].
  1115	
  1116	digital signal processing - This is what is used to perform echo 
  1117	cancellation on a CCITT V.32/V.42 modem.  [Same as DSP].  [See 
  1118	also echo cancellation].
  1119	
  1120	DIP switch - DIP stands for Dual In-line Package.  DIP switches 
  1121	are a group of small switches placed together on electronic 
  1122	equipment.  Many modems have these.  The switches can be changed 
  1123	to alter various settings.  For example, one DIP switch on a 
  1124	modem may change the status of the DTR.
  1125	
  1126	direct mode - See MNP direct mode.
  1127	
  1128	disconnect - To hang up the phone and cause the connection be-
  1129	tween your modem and another computer to be stopped.  Most BBS 
  1130	programs have a way of disconnecting a user who has called the 
  1131	bulletin board, if it is needed.
  1132	
  1133	disk capture - This is when a communications program will save
  1134	incoming information to the disk.  This is useful if you are
  1135	receiving a text file that you want to read later.
  1136	
  1137	dither tone - See echo suppressor defeat tone.
  1138	
  1139	door - A gateway that will allow a bulletin board to run a pro-
  1140	gram while a user is on the BBS.  Games are popular doors on 
  1141	BBS's, although doors can be used for serious purposes, too.
  1142	
  1143	down - A word meaning that a bulletin board is not working, so 
  1144	that you can not connect with it.  This can mean that there was a 
  1145	crash, or it could simply mean that the SysOp is playing a game 
  1146	on his computer.  Often a SysOp will leave a phone connected to 
  1147	his BBS line off the hook when he is using the computer so that 
  1148	you will get a busy signal.  [See also running].
  1149	
  1150	download - To receive a computer file from a bulletin board.  It 
  1151	is usually a computer program, but can also be a text file.  [See 
  1152	also upload, protocol].
  1153	
  1154	DSP - See Digital Signal Processing.
  1155	
  1156	DSR - Data Set Ready.  This indicates that the modem is on, and 
  1157	ready to accept input from the computer (either commands or data 
  1158	to be sent over the phone line).  [Same as modem ready].
  1159	
  1160	DTE - Data Terminal Equipment.  This is computer equipment which 
  1161	is not directly responsible for communicating, for example, the 
  1162	computer itself and printers.  [See also DCE].
  1163	
  1164	DTMF - Dual Tone Multi-Frequency.  This is used in tone dialing.  
  1165	It is a method where 2 distinct tones are sent for each digit 
  1166	dialed.
  1167	
  1168	DTR - Stands for Data Terminal Ready.  The DTR signal is sent 
  1169	from the computer to the modem, to let the modem know that the 
  1170	computer is ready to communicate.
  1171	
  1172	dumb modem - A modem that only sends and receives characters to 
  1173	or from the phone line.  [See also smart modem].
  1174	
  1175	dumb terminal - A keyboard and monitor that receive and send 
  1176	information either to or from another computer or a phone line.  
  1177	It is up to the other computer to do anything else, such as word 
  1178	wrap.  [See also terminal, smart terminal].
  1179	
  1180	duplex - The capability of both sides of a connection to send 
  1181	information at the same time.  Full duplex is the same as duplex.  
  1182	When you are talking on the telephone to someone you are using 
  1183	duplex (you can both talk at the same time if you want to).  [See 
  1184	also half duplex].
  1185	
  1186	
  1187	
  1188	---E---
  1189	
  1190	
  1191	
  1192	EBCDIC - Stands for Extended Binary-Coded Decimal Interchange 
  1193	Code.  It is a way of coding characters.  It is similar to ASCII, 
  1194	but it uses 8 bits instead of 7.  [See also ASCII].
  1195	
  1196	EBBS - Electronic Bulletin Board System.  See BBS.
  1197	
  1198	echo - [1] A character that is sent back from a BBS instead of 
  1199	the character that was sent to the BBS.  For example, if you 
  1200	enter your password on a BBS it will often say `dots will echo', 
  1201	meaning that it will send a period for every character in your 
  1202	password (it is a safety feature).  [2] When a bulletin board or 
  1203	your terminal program sends back the characters that you type.  
  1204	If the bulletin board does not send back the characters, your 
  1205	terminal program should print them to your screen as you type 
  1206	them.  [3] Echo on the phone lines is when you hear an echo on a 
  1207	long distance call.  This can interfere with modem transmissions.  
  1208	[See also local echo, echo suppression].
  1209	
  1210	echomail - This is a technique used by many BBS's that will allow 
  1211	a message base to be shared by many BBS's.  Usually late at night 
  1212	the BBS's will exchange any new messages.  This way a user on one 
  1213	BBS can interact with users on other BBS's.
  1214	
  1215	echo canceling - This is included in the CCITT V.32 standard.  It 
  1216	attempts to cancel echoing on long distance calls, which other-
  1217	wise would interfere with the transmission.  It sends the exact 
  1218	opposite of the sound it receives, which cancels the echo.  [See 
  1219	also echo suppression, digital signal processing].
  1220	
  1221	echo suppression - Echo suppression is a technique that the phone 
  1222	company uses in an attempt to make long distance voice calls 
  1223	sound better, by minimizing echo.  However, this can cause the 
  1224	carrier of a modem to be lost (or at least garbled, causing a 
  1225	loss of data).  In order to prevent this problem, a modem needs 
  1226	to send a certain tone over the phone line at all times.  [See 
  1227	also echo suppression defeat tone].
  1228	
  1229	echo suppression defeat tone - This is a signal sent over the 
  1230	phone lines by some modems in an attempt to cancel out the nega-
  1231	tive effects of echo suppression.  In the Bell standard, it is 
  1232	2225Hz +/- 10Hz, in CCITT standards it is 2100Hz +/- 15Hz.  [Same 
  1233	as dither tone].  [See also echo suppression].
  1234	
  1235	editor - The part of the BBS that allows you to enter a message 
  1236	and edit it.
  1237	
  1238	effective throughput rate - See effective transfer rate.
  1239	
  1240	effective transfer rate - This is the rate at which data can be 
  1241	sent after data compression has been accounted for.  For example, 
  1242	a modem may be rated at 9600bps.  If it uses data compression 
  1243	with a ratio that averages 2:1, it has an effective transfer rate 
  1244	of 19,200bps.  While only 9600 bits are sent over the phone line, 
  1245	they represent 19,200 bits of real information after they are 
  1246	decoded.  [Same as throughput, data throughput, effective 
  1247	throughput rate].  [See also raw speed, data compression].
  1248	
  1249	EIA - Electronics Industry Association.  They developed the RS-
  1250	232C standard.  [See also RS-232C].
  1251	
  1252	electronic mail - See E-mail.
  1253	
  1254	E-mail - Electronic mail.  Messages that are sent to individual 
  1255	people.  You choose who to send the message to and only that  
  1256	person receives the message.  (Some BBS programs allow you to 
  1257	send bulk E-mail, which goes to more than one person, but the 
  1258	concept is still the same.)
  1259	
  1260	emotion icons - These are groups of several characters that are 
  1261	used to express emotion over the phone line.  For example, :) is 
  1262	a happy face (when you look at it from the side).  Similarly, :( 
  1263	is a sad face.
  1264	
  1265	emulate - When a communications program imitates a certain brand 
  1266	of terminal.
  1267	
  1268	encoder dictionary - See dictionary.
  1269	
  1270	encryption - Coding data so that people who are not supposed to 
  1271	see the data will not be able to understand it.
  1272	
  1273	ENQ character - This is the same as Control-E, ASCII value 5.  It 
  1274	stands for Enquiry.
  1275	
  1276	EOF - Stands for End Of File.  It is the character CTRL-Z, which 
  1277	can mark the end of a text file.
  1278	
  1279	equalization - When a modem adjusts its transmit level for dif-
  1280	ferent frequencies, to account for the greater loss at certain 
  1281	frequencies over the phone line.  [See also transmit level, 
  1282	receive level].
  1283	
  1284	error - When there is line noise and one or more characters are 
  1285	changed.  This is especially noticeable when downloading or 
  1286	uploading a program.  In this case the error must be detected, 
  1287	and the data must be re-sent (or else the file will be 
  1288	destroyed).  [See also line noise].
  1289	
  1290	error control - The ability of a modem to notice errors in trans-
  1291	mission, and have any incorrect data re-sent.  [See also MNP 1-4, 
  1292	LAPM, V.42].
  1293	
  1294	error correction - See error control.  (Error control is a more 
  1295	correct term, since the modem does not correct incorrect data, it 
  1296	just has it sent again).
  1297	
  1298	error free - When referring to data transmission, error free 
  1299	refers to communications equipment in which data is transmitted 
  1300	perfectly.  This is actually an impossible situation, but it is 
  1301	possible to have data that is very, very close to error-free.
  1302	
  1303	ESC - See escape key.
  1304	
  1305	escape character - ASCII character 27.  [See also escape key, 
  1306	ASCII].
  1307	
  1308	escape character guard time - See guard time.
  1309	
  1310	escape code - See escape sequence.
  1311	
  1312	escape key - The key marked ESC on a computer keyboard.  It is 
  1313	often used to 'escape' out of a program or procedure in a pro-
  1314	gram.  Also, the ASCII character (ASCII 27) is used by ANSI to 
  1315	produce limited graphics.  [Same as ESC].  [See also ANSI].
  1316	
  1317	escape sequence - A sequence of characters (usually +++) that 
  1318	instruct a modem to change from data mode to command mode, if 
  1319	they are typed with a certain delay before and after they are 
  1320	typed.  [See also data mode, command mode, guard time].
  1321	
  1322	even parity - This indicates that the parity bit is always set 
  1323	such that the sum of the "1" bits in each byte that is sent, plus 
  1324	the parity bit, is an even number.  [See also parity bit, 
  1325	format].
  1326	
  1327	executive mode - When a user is connected to a bulletin board, 
  1328	but the SysOp is controlling the bulletin board.  The most common 
  1329	use of an executive mode is when the SysOp validates users with-
  1330	out the user having to hang up.
  1331	
  1332	exit - See logoff.
  1333	
  1334	expedited signaling - Break signals that are sent before any 
  1335	other data.  All data will remain intact.  [See also break sig-
  1336	nal].
  1337	
  1338	expert mode - Many BBS's have this feature, which allows a user 
  1339	who feels that he knows the system well to save time by not 
  1340	having menus sent to his system.  If he forgets some commands 
  1341	that are available, he can have the menu appear.  Otherwise, the 
  1342	menus will not appear.  This is especially helpful at slow 
  1343	speeds.
  1344	
  1345	extension - The extension of a filename on an MS-DOS system is 
  1346	the last three characters, which are separated from the rest of 
  1347	the filename by a period.  For example, the filename SPREDSHT.WKS 
  1348	has the extension "WKS".  [See also archive].
  1349	
  1350	external modem - A modem that is located outside of the computer.  
  1351	It is hooked up to the computer with a cable, most commonly an 
  1352	RS-232C cable.  [Same as stand-alone modem].  [See also internal 
  1353	modem].
  1354	
  1355	external program - A computer program that is separate from 
  1356	another program.  When BBS software runs a program that is sepa-
  1357	rate from it, it is called an external program.  [See also door].
  1358	
  1359	external protocol - This is a file transfer program that is not 
  1360	built into your comm program, but the comm program is able to run 
  1361	it anyway (as an external program).  [See also internal proto-
  1362	col].
  1363	
  1364	extract - To take out files from an archive.  [See also archive, 
  1365	unarchive].
  1366	
  1367	
  1368	
  1369	---F---
  1370	
  1371	
  1372	
  1373	factory configuration - The way that your modem was set up when 
  1374	it left the factory.  Typing ATZ normally returns your modem to 
  1375	the factory configuration.
  1376	
  1377	fall-back - The ability of a modem to change to a lower speed 
  1378	when there is a problem communicating at the higher speed (usual-
  1379	ly caused by line noise).  [Same as auto fall-back].
  1380	
  1381	fall-forward - This is when a modem will change to a faster speed 
  1382	if line conditions improve after a fall-back occurs.
  1383	
  1384	fax - Short for facsimile.  It is a copy of a piece of paper that 
  1385	is sent over the phone lines by a fax machine.  Some modems also 
  1386	have fax machines built in them, so that they can send and/or 
  1387	receive faxes.  [See also faxmodem].
  1388	
  1389	faxmodem - A modem that also has the capability of sending and 
  1390	receiving faxes.  [See also fax].
  1391	
  1392	FCC - Federal Communications Commission.  This is the government 
  1393	agency that is responsible for making sure that phone lines are 
  1394	being used correctly and that radio interference is at acceptable 
  1395	levels.
  1396	
  1397	FDM - Frequency Division Multiplexing.  A way that some modems 
  1398	transmit full duplex information, by splitting the telephone 
  1399	bandwidth into two sections.  One is used to receive data, the 
  1400	other is used to send data.  This method can be used at speeds of 
  1401	up to 2400bps.  [See also modulate].
  1402	
  1403	feature negotiation - This is when a modem can determine the best 
  1404	protocol to use when connecting to another modem.  This includes 
  1405	the fastest speed, error control, and data compression.  It is 
  1406	part of hand-shaking.  [Same as negotiation scheme].
  1407	
  1408	feedback - A message that is sent by a user to the SysOp of a 
  1409	bulletin board.  While it is meant to be a way for the user to 
  1410	let the SysOp know of any complaints or compliments they may 
  1411	have, it is more often a convenient way of sending E-mail to the 
  1412	SysOp.
  1413	
  1414	filter - When a communications program or a BBS program takes out 
  1415	certain characters or words and doesn't accept them.  For exam-
  1416	ple, a bulletin board program may filter out CTRL-G's so that the 
  1417	SysOp does not hear the beeping.  Also, some BBS programs have 
  1418	the ability to take out obscene words from messages.  [See also 
  1419	profanity filter].
  1420	
  1421	filter device - A piece of hardware which goes between the modem 
  1422	and the phone line of a BBS.  When a user calls up, they will 
  1423	either have a voice or computer connection that asks them for a 
  1424	special password before they can gain access to the main computer 
  1425	system.  This makes it more difficult for hackers to get into the 
  1426	system, but is also more of a burden for the legitimate users.
  1427	
  1428	flash - On a normal telephone, this is when you quickly push down 
  1429	and release the off-hook button.  It is often used for call 
  1430	waiting.  Many modems have a command that will simulate this 
  1431	action.
  1432	
  1433	flag - A piece of information that is either TRUE or FALSE.  It 
  1434	is used in some bulletin board security systems to indicate 
  1435	whether the user has access to certain parts of the bulletin 
  1436	board.  It is also used by modems for certain indicators such as 
  1437	DTR.
  1438	
  1439	flow control - A method of controlling when information is sent. 
  1440	One method is Xon/Xoff, where a BBS will send information until 
  1441	your computer sends an Xoff (CTRL-S).  It will resume sending 
  1442	information when you send an Xon (CTRL-Q).  [See also Xon/Xoff, 
  1443	CTS/RTS].
  1444	
  1445	format - Information such as "8N1" that describes the way that 
  1446	your computer and a bulletin board should be connected.  The 
  1447	first digit is normally 7 or 8, the number of data bits.  The 
  1448	second character is a letter describing the parity (N for None, M 
  1449	for Mark, S for Space, O for Odd, and E for Even).  The last 
  1450	number is the number of stop bits.  8N1 is the most common for-
  1451	mat.  Data is sent as follows: Start bit (0) - 7 or 8 bits of 
  1452	data - (parity bit, if used) - stop bit (1) - (gap bits, if used) 
  1453	[Same as settings].
  1454	
  1455	forward - To send E-mail that you received to someone else.
  1456	
  1457	framing bits - Bits that are used to separate characters.  The 
  1458	bits themselves are not used as information.  [See also stop 
  1459	bits, start bits].
  1460	
  1461	framing error - This occurs when the UART in a modem does not 
  1462	detect a stop bit.  The modems are probably out of sync with each 
  1463	other.
  1464	
  1465	freeware - Computer programs that are copyrighted, but they may 
  1466	be legally copied if there is no payment involved.  They are 
  1467	almost the same as public domain programs, except that public 
  1468	domain programs are not copyrighted and may be sold for payment.  
  1469	Freeware programs often can not be changed when they are distrib-
  1470	uted.  [See also public domain].
  1471	
  1472	frequency division multiplexing - See FDM
  1473	
  1474	frequency shift keying - See FSK.
  1475	
  1476	frequency spectrum - A range of frequencies having similar char-
  1477	acteristics.  All sounds we hear are grouped as the audio fre-
  1478	quency spectrum.  Similar to bandwidth.
  1479	
  1480	FSK - Frequency Shift Keying.  This method that low-speed modems 
  1481	use to transmit information over phone lines uses 4 frequencies, 
  1482	which are used to represent 0's and 1's for both sending and 
  1483	receiving.  These modems can only operate up to a speed of 600bps 
  1484	at full duplex (or 1200bps at half duplex).  [See also modula-
  1485	tion].
  1486	
  1487	full duplex - See duplex.
  1488	
  1489	full flow - See streaming.
  1490

  1492	
  1493	---G---
  1494	
  1495	
  1496	
  1497	gap - See gap bits.
  1498	
  1499	gap bits - A series of 0's that are sometimes sent between data 
  1500	bytes over the phone lines.
  1501	
  1502	garbage - Unwanted characters that appear because of either line
  1503	noise or incorrect settings.  [See also line noise, format].
  1504	
  1505	gateway - A connection between one network and another.  For 
  1506	example, on some commercial on-line services, you can reserve 
  1507	airplane tickets.  This usually involves the on-line service you 
  1508	called connecting to the airline's computer.
  1509	
  1510	general file - Any kind of text on a bulletin board that is not 
  1511	specifically E-mail, a bulletin of any sort, or a message.  
  1512	Usually they are long files for the user's information.  Some 
  1513	examples of general files are: a file containing more information 
  1514	on the bulletin board program, a newspaper article about a con-
  1515	troversial issue, and an article that explains how to make your 
  1516	own disk drive.  
  1517	
  1518	global scan - When a bulletin board goes through all the messages 
  1519	on all boards to check for new messages that the user has not yet 
  1520	read.  This is very useful as it prevents the user from having to 
  1521	go through each board to check for new messages.  [See also 
  1522	quickscan].
  1523	
  1524	goodbye - See logoff.
  1525	
  1526	group III FAX - The standard controlling fax communication.
  1527	
  1528	guard time - When the escape sequence is sent to your modem, the 
  1529	guard time is the amount of time that must occur between charac-
  1530	ters of the escape code, for it to be considered the escape code.  
  1531	Otherwise, it will assume you are entering data that is meant to 
  1532	be sent to the other modem.  [See also escape code, data mode, 
  1533	command mode].
  1534	
  1535	guard tone - A tone that is sometimes sent over the phone line 
  1536	for echo suppression.  1800 hertz and 550 hertz are sometimes 
  1537	used.
  1538	
  1539	guest - When a user is just looking at a bulletin board and does 
  1540	not want to receive an account there.  The user usually has the 
  1541	same privileges as a new user who has not yet been validated.  
  1542	Many bulletin board programs allow guests.  This is a good fea-
  1543	ture, since the SysOp does not have to validate users who will 
  1544	not be calling the board more than once or twice.
  1545	
  1546	
  1547	
  1548	---H---
  1549	
  1550	
  1551	
  1552	hacker - [1] A programmer who likes to experiment with computers 
  1553	(this is the type of person who often will not read the documen-
  1554	tation to software before using it, so he can figure out how to 
  1555	use it by himself).  [2] A person who attempts to abuse the 
  1556	privileges of computer BBS's and other services.  His activities 
  1557	may range from getting and exploring an account he is not sup-
  1558	posed to have on a mainframe computer to attempting to crash a 
  1559	bulletin board.  These people are unwanted by most BBS's.  They 
  1560	are often not malicious.  The media sometimes confuses them with 
  1561	phreakers. [See also phreaker].
  1562	
  1563	half card - For IBM compatible computers, this is a card that is 
  1564	smaller than normal (about half the size).  It does not affect 
  1565	the operation of the modem.
  1566	
  1567	half duplex - This is a mode which allows only one modem at a 
  1568	time to transmit information.  When one modem is finished, the 
  1569	other can then start to transmit.  [Same as simplex].  [See also 
  1570	duplex].
  1571	
  1572	hand-shaking - The process of establishing an electronic link 
  1573	between two modems.  Handshaking lets both modems know informa-
  1574	tion such as the speed they will be using, and whether or not the 
  1575	modems have the same type of error correction capability.  [See 
  1576	also feature negotiation].
  1577	
  1578	handle - See alias.
  1579	
  1580	hang - When a bulletin board all of a sudden starts to do noth-
  1581	ing.  That is, it will not accept calls or even let the SysOp 
  1582	type anything until the computer is reset.  This can be caused by 
  1583	a problem with the BBS software, or the computer itself.
  1584	
  1585	hang up - When someone closes a switch which stops a telephone 
  1586	connection.  This either happens when someone puts a telephone 
  1587	receiver into its cradle or when the person instructs the modem 
  1588	to hang up.
  1589	
  1590	hardware error control - This is when error control is performed 
  1591	by the modem, not the communications program.  [See also error 
  1592	control].
  1593	
  1594	Hayes compatible - Any modem which operates in the same way as 
  1595	the modems developed by Hayes.  Most modems up to 2400bps are 
  1596	Hayes compatible.
  1597	
  1598	Hayes AT command set - This is the set of commands used to oper-
  1599	ate Hayes modems and Hayes compatible modems.  Almost all of the 
  1600	commands start with AT.
  1601	
  1602	help file - Many BBS systems will include information on how to 
  1603	run the system in case you are having troubles.  Often just 
  1604	pressing "H" or a question mark at the main menu will show you 
  1605	the information, but with some systems you have to find the help 
  1606	file somewhere, occasionally amidst the files to be downloaded.
  1607	
  1608	hertz - A unit of frequency, which equals cycles per second.
  1609	
  1610	high speed - A modem that operates at a high speed.  In most 
  1611	cases it is assumed to be at least 9600bps.
  1612	
  1613	host - The computer that is being used to store information from 
  1614	other computers.  Every BBS is a host, and so are pay services.
  1615	
  1616	host program - A computer program that allows your computer to 
  1617	accept incoming calls, and let the callers upload or download 
  1618	files.  It is limited compared to a BBS.  If you want to do any-
  1619	thing more, such as record information or print it out, you 
  1620	usually have to do the programming yourself.  [Similar to unat-
  1621	tended mode].
  1622	
  1623	hot-keys - A term which means that you only have to press one key 
  1624	at a menu, rather than several.  You don't have to hit the return 
  1625	key.  Usually you can do this while a menu is being sent to your 
  1626	computer (so you don't have to wait for the whole menu to be 
  1627	sent).
  1628	
  1629	HST - High Speed Technology.  A high speed protocol developed by 
  1630	US Robotics.  It allows for 14400bps one way, and 450bps the 
  1631	other way.  The two computers can switch when one has more infor-
  1632	mation to send than the other.  It is not compatible with the 
  1633	CCITT protocol.
  1634	
  1635	hyphen - The character -.
  1636	
  1637	Hz. - See hertz.
  1638	
  1639	
  1640	
  1641	---I---
  1642	
  1643	
  1644	
  1645	IBM graphics - On IBM computers, there is a group of "graphic" 
  1646	characters (such as lines, used to make boxes) that can be shown 
  1647	on the screen.  Some BBS's will send these graphic characters if 
  1648	requested.  Most non-IBM computers will not recognize these 
  1649	characters.  These characters' bytes have their 8th bit set to 1.
  1650	
  1651	ID number - See user number.
  1652	
  1653	idle time - When a computer is not being used.  This refers to 
  1654	either  a computer running a BBS that is not busy, or a caller 
  1655	that is not sending anything or receiving anything.  Some BBS's 
  1656	will hang up a user if there is a certain amount of idle time 
  1657	(such as a minute).
  1658	
  1659	inactivity timer - When this is on, a modem will automatically 
  1660	disconnect from a remote computer after a given amount of time 
  1661	passes without any information sent or received.
  1662	
  1663	incoming - Information that is being sent to your computer.
  1664	
  1665	information - Any data that is sent between computers.  Data 
  1666	usually refers to numbers and small pieces of information.  
  1667	Information is usually used for larger things, such as text 
  1668	files.  [See also data].
  1669	
  1670	initialize - To set up either hardware or software to work cor-
  1671	rectly with your system.  Many modems have to be initialized each 
  1672	time they are used so they `know' how to act with the communica-
  1673	tions program.  When your software initializes your modem, it may 
  1674	tell the modem to expect 2400 baud and no parity, as well as the 
  1675	fact that you do not want any information to echo on your screen.  
  1676	[See also initialization string].
  1677	
  1678	initialization string - This is the command that your communica-
  1679	tions program sends to the modem when the program is started.  In 
  1680	most cases, it is an AT command just like you would type in.  
  1681	[See also initialization].
  1682	
  1683	interdigit interval - When pulse dialing is used, you need a 
  1684	certain amount of time free of "clicks" so that the phone company 
  1685	knows when each digit is finished.  When you are dialing on a 
  1686	rotary phone, you don't need to worry about this because the time 
  1687	it takes to turn the dial is sufficient.  A modem that sends 
  1688	pulse codes must wait a specified amount of time before going 
  1689	from one digit to the next in a phone number.  A value between 
  1690	1/2 second a 1 second is usually used.
  1691	
  1692	internal modem - A modem that is `hidden' inside your computer.  
  1693	Outside of your computer you will only see the phone cord.  An 
  1694	internal modem can either be on a peripheral card that is placed 
  1695	inside your computer, or it can be built into your computer.  
  1696	[See also external modem].
  1697	
  1698	internal protocol - A file transfer protocol that comes as part 
  1699	of a comm program, and is not separate from it.  [See also exter-
  1700	nal protocol].
  1701	
  1702	interrupt - An interrupt, as far as modems and computers are
  1703	concerned, is an electronic signal that tells the computer that
  1704	something important is happening.  Most modems can be set up by
  1705	software to send an interrupt every time a character is received
  1706	by the modem.  When operating at fast speeds, this makes sure
  1707	that the computer doesn't miss characters as it is printing them
  1708	on the screen or saving them to a disk.
  1709	
  1710	in sequence signaling - Break signals that are sent in the proper 
  1711	order among data, as opposed to expedited signaling (which will 
  1712	send the signal before other data).  No data is harmed, it all 
  1713	remains intact.  [See also break signal].
  1714	
  1715	
  1716	
  1717	---J---
  1718	
  1719	
  1720	
  1721	jack - The small plastic box that your phone cord connects to on 
  1722	your wall.
  1723	
  1724	jump - A command used on some BBS's to go from one board or 
  1725	section on a BBS to another.
  1726	
  1727	jumper - This is a piece of plastic and metal that can be moved 
  1728	on an internal modem to change a setting, such as the COM port to 
  1729	be used.  [See also selectable COM port].
  1730	
  1731	
  1732	
  1733	---K---
  1734	
  1735	
  1736	
  1737	K - When K is placed after a number, it means 1024 times that 
  1738	number.  If you computer has 640K that means that it has a little 
  1739	more than 640,000 bytes of memory.  Often communications software 
  1740	will tell you that you have a certain amount of free memory to 
  1741	use as a buffer.
  1742	
  1743	Kermit protocol - An almost error-free file transfer protocol 
  1744	usually used for text transfers.  It was developed at Columbia 
  1745	University.  [See also protocol].
  1746	
  1747	keyboard macro - A macro that will allow you to hit one or sever-
  1748	al keys and have the program act as though you had typed a lot 
  1749	directly from the keyboard.  [See also macro].
  1750	
  1751	kill - When referring to a message on a bulletin board, it means 
  1752	deleting that message from the board.  Usually you can only 
  1753	delete the messages that you write (unless you are a SysOp).
  1754	
  1755	
  1756	
  1757	---L---
  1758	
  1759	
  1760	
  1761	LAN - Local Area Network.  This is a group of computers that are 
  1762	all connected.  Usually, there is one computer that controls all 
  1763	peripherals (such as printers and a hard disk drive).  The other 
  1764	computers are linked to the controlling computer, which lets the 
  1765	other computers take turns using the peripherals.  [Same as 
  1766	computer network].
  1767	
  1768	LAPB - Link Access Procedure Balanced.  This is a form of error 
  1769	control found in X.32 packet switched networks.
  1770	
  1771	LAPM - Link Access Procedure for Modems.  A type of error control 
  1772	used by some modems.  It is included in the V.42 protocol 
  1773	(V.42bis also includes it, since V.42bis includes all V.42 error 
  1774	control methods).  It is NOT a compression method, even though 
  1775	some modem manufacturers have incorrectly advertised it as such.  
  1776	[See also V.42, error control].
  1777	
  1778	leased line - A telephone line that directly connects two comput-
  1779	ers.  It is usually rented from the telephone company.  A leased 
  1780	line doesn't have many of the electronic restrictions that a 
  1781	dialup line has, so data can be sent faster.  However, data 
  1782	therefore can only be sent between those two computers.  [Compare 
  1783	to dialup line].  [Same as private line].
  1784	
  1785	LED indicators - The lights on external modems that indicate 
  1786	conditions such as speed, RD, DCD, etc.
  1787	
  1788	leech - A person who downloads a lot from a BBS, and does not 
  1789	contribute much to the BBS by uploading programs or using the 
  1790	message bases.
  1791	
  1792	left-brace - The character {.  It's not used often.
  1793	
  1794	left-bracket - The character [.
  1795	
  1796	letter - [1] The characters A-Z (uppercase or lowercase)  [2] 
  1797	Another term for a message posted on a BBS.
  1798	
  1799	LF - Line Feed.  This is a control character (ASCII 10) that is 
  1800	used on some computers and printers to move down one line (on the 
  1801	screen or paper).  It is usually used right after a carriage 
  1802	return.  [See also return].
  1803	
  1804	LHARC - A program that will extract archives with the extension 
  1805	"LZH".  [See also archive, LZH].
  1806	
  1807	line - [1] A row of characters on your screen, for example, many 
  1808	computers have screens with 25 lines.  [See also columns].  [2] 
  1809	The connection between your computer and a BBS.  Most commonly 
  1810	used in the term "line noise."  [3] A phone line connected to a 
  1811	BBS.  For example, a BBS might advertise that it has "4 lines," 
  1812	meaning that 4 people can call the BBS and use it at the same 
  1813	time.  [Same as node].
  1814	
  1815	line delay - See delay time.
  1816	
  1817	linefeed - See LF.
  1818	
  1819	line noise - This is interference on the telephone lines.  It 
  1820	will cause a character or many characters of garbage to appear on 
  1821	your screen.  In general, the higher the bps rate of your modem, 
  1822	the more line noise will appear.  However, error control proto-
  1823	cols strive to eliminate line noise (and get rid of most of it).  
  1824	[See also error control].
  1825	
  1826	link access procedure - See LAPM, LAPB.
  1827	
  1828	local - On a computer that is running a BBS, there are 1 or more 
  1829	phone lines connected to it.  However, the SysOp can usually use 
  1830	the BBS, too, from the keyboard.  This is considered a local 
  1831	connection.
  1832	
  1833	local analog loopback - Tests the connection between a modem and 
  1834	the computer.  [See also local digital loopback].
  1835	
  1836	local area network - See LAN.
  1837	
  1838	local call - A phone call to a phone number in your local area, 
  1839	which will not incur long distance charges.  [See also long 
  1840	distance call].
  1841	
  1842	local digital loopback - Tests the connections between a comput-
  1843	er, the modem, the phone line, and the remote computer.  [See 
  1844	also local analog loopback].
  1845	
  1846	local echo - This is when a communications program will send 
  1847	information (either that you type or from a file) to your screen, 
  1848	as well as to the other modem.  Usually local echo is not used, 
  1849	and the BBS you are connected to will send the information back 
  1850	to you, and only then will the communications program print what 
  1851	you typed on your screen.
  1852	
  1853	local number - The phone number used after a country code, area 
  1854	code and/or a city code.  In the United States, it is 7 digits 
  1855	long.
  1856	
  1857	log - A log is a file that keeps track of some kind of use.  In a 
  1858	communications program, it might keep track of what BBS's you 
  1859	call.  A BBS can keep a user log, which is a file that indicates 
  1860	which users called up and when.  [See also user log].
  1861	
  1862	logic bomb - This is part of a software program that will do 
  1863	something malicious.  For example, the author of a BBS program 
  1864	might have the program set up so that if he enters his initials 
  1865	in a certain point while the program is running, it will destroy 
  1866	all of the files on the BBS.  These are no longer as common as 
  1867	they used to be.
  1868	
  1869	logoff - To leave a BBS.  When you choose to logoff, the BBS will 
  1870	usually ask if that's what you really want to do, then it will 
  1871	hangup.  It may also ask if you want to leave a note to the 
  1872	SysOp.  [Same as exit, quit, goodbye].
  1873	
  1874	logon - The process of connecting to a BBS.  The is what occurs 
  1875	after you have called the computer and the phone starts to ring, 
  1876	but before you actually start using the BBS.  "Logon" can also 
  1877	include the process of entering your name and password (which is 
  1878	also called sign-on).  [See also signon].
  1879	
  1880	long distance call - A telephone call that is outside your local 
  1881	calling area, and that you must pay for.  [See also local call].
  1882	
  1883	lowercase - The letters that are normally used, such as in this 
  1884	sentence.  The other kind of letters are UPPERCASE.  [See also 
  1885	uppercase].
  1886	
  1887	lurk - This is a term used on some CB simulators, which means 
  1888	that the person is leaving his computer for a while (and there-
  1889	fore will not be able to respond to messages).
  1890	
  1891	LZH - This file extension refers to an archive that was com-
  1892	pressed with the program LHARC.  You need to get the program 
  1893	LHARC from a BBS before you can un-archive the file.  [See also 
  1894	archive, unarchive, LHARC].
  1895	
  1896	
  1897	
  1898	---M---
  1899	
  1900	
  1901	
  1902	macro - A series of instructions or text that can be entered by
  1903	hitting a couple of keys.  For example, a communication program
  1904	might let you enter your user name and password just by hitting
  1905	CTRL-N.  [See also trigger character].
  1906	
  1907	mainframe - A large computer that many people can use at the same 
  1908	time.  Usually, a mainframe computer is owned by a large company, 
  1909	and it has a lot of memory and storage for its users.  Some 
  1910	mainframes have phone lines connected to them so that employees 
  1911	(or other authorized people) can use the mainframe from home.
  1912	
  1913	make/break pulse ratio - During pulse dialing, the make/break 
  1914	pulse ratio is the ratio of the time that the phone is off the 
  1915	hook to the time the phone is on the hook.  In America and Cana-
  1916	da, it should be 39/61.  
  1917	
  1918	manual-syncing driver - This is what a BBS uses if the BBS pro-
  1919	gram can not determine directly what the user's bps rate is, and 
  1920	the user must hit the return key several times before the BBS can 
  1921	figure out the user's speed.
  1922	
  1923	mark - When you are looking at the titles of messages to read, 
  1924	some BBS programs will allow you to choose certain ones you want 
  1925	to read.  This is called marking.
  1926	
  1927	mark bit - A bit that is set to 1.  [See also space bit].
  1928	
  1929	mark parity - This is when the parity bit is always set to a 
  1930	binary 1.  [See also parity bit, format].
  1931	
  1932	maximum string length - In V.42bis data compression, this refers 
  1933	to the maximum length of data (in characters) represented by one 
  1934	word.  It can range from 6 to 250 characters, although it is 
  1935	usually 32.
  1936	
  1937	menu - A list of options that you can choose from.  A BBS might 
  1938	have a menu that lets you choose from reading messages, download-
  1939	ing, or logging off.  In reality, there would be many more op-
  1940	tions.
  1941	
  1942	message - Any text that is left in a message base on a BBS.  
  1943	These can range from questions for other users to answer, to 
  1944	information on new computer programs, to just about any topic you 
  1945	could imagine.
  1946	
  1947	message base - A group of messages on a BBS pertaining to a 
  1948	certain topic.  For example, a BBS might have message bases for 
  1949	general messages, computer-related messages, and social informa-
  1950	tion.  Some BBS's have dozens or even hundreds of message bases.  
  1951	[Same as subboard, board].
  1952	
  1953	minicomputer - A scaled-down version of a mainframe.  A minicom-
  1954	puter usually has many terminals connected to it, and can run
  1955	many programs at the same time.  It is more powerful than a
  1956	microcomputer.
  1957	
  1958	MNP - Microcom Networking Protocol.  A type of error control and 
  1959	data compression, created by Microcom, that many newer modems 
  1960	use.  It is built into the modem, unlike software error correc-
  1961	tion in file transfer protocols.  There are different MNP levels.  
  1962	Levels 1-4 are error control protocols, and level 5 is a data 
  1963	compression protocol that can compress data to about 50% of its 
  1964	original size.  A modem with MNP-5 also has MNP-4.  MNP 1-4 is 
  1965	also included in the CCITT V.42 error correction system.
  1966	
  1967	MNP direct mode - This is a mode used on modems with the MNP 
  1968	protocols, where the speeds from the modem to the remote modem 
  1969	and to the computer are the same.  Also, there is no buffering, 
  1970	and no flow control.  [Same as direct mode].  [See also MNP 
  1971	normal mode].
  1972	
  1973	MNP normal mode - This is the more common mode used with modems 
  1974	that have MNP capability, where the speed from the computer to 
  1975	the modem can be higher than the connection between the modem and 
  1976	the remote modem.  This mode uses buffering to prevent lost data.  
  1977	[Same as normal mode].  [See also MNP direct mode].
  1978	
  1979	mode - The state that a computer or a program is in.  For exam-
  1980	ple, a computer can be in a text mode, and a communications 
  1981	program can be in a chat mode (which operates differently than 
  1982	the normal mode).
  1983	
  1984	modem - MODulator/DEModulator.  This is a computer peripheral 
  1985	which allows a computer to communicate over telephone lines.  
  1986	This is the heart of computer telecommunications.  The main 
  1987	factor that differentiates modems is their speed, measured in 
  1988	bps.
  1989	
  1990	modem ready - See DSR.
  1991	
  1992	modify - See edit.
  1993	
  1994	modular cord - A standard telephone cord, with a modular plug at 
  1995	either end.  [Same as modular line.  [See also modular jack, 
  1996	modular plug].
  1997	
  1998	modular jack - The square hole in which you put telephone cord 
  1999	(that has a modular plug).  [See also modular cord, modular plug, 
  2000	42A block].
  2001	
  2002	modular line - See modular cord.
  2003	
  2004	modular plug - The square piece of plastic at the end of a tele-
  2005	phone cord.  It plugs into a modular jack.  [See also modular 
  2006	cord, modular jack].
  2007	
  2008	modulate - When a modem changes information from computer bits 
  2009	into tones that can be transmitted over the phone lines.  Differ-
  2010	ent methods of modulation are PSK, FSK, and FDM.  [See also 
  2011	demodulate, PSK, FSK, FDM].
  2012	
  2013	modulation scheme - The method that a modem uses to modulate 
  2014	data.  [See also PSK, FSK, FDM].
  2015	
  2016	MTA - Message Transfer Agent.  This is what moves data across a
  2017	network under the X.400 electronic mail system.  [See also
  2018	X.400].
  2019	
  2020	multiple-speed - This refers to a modem that can operate at 
  2021	several speeds.  Most modems are capable of doing this.  While a 
  2022	modem may be listed as having a speed of 2400bps, it most likely 
  2023	also can operate at 1200bps and 300bps.
  2024	
  2025	multiple-state modulation - A modulation scheme that sends more 
  2026	than one bit per baud.
  2027	
  2028	multi-line BBS - A BBS that has more than one line or node.  [See 
  2029	also line].
  2030	
  2031	
  2032	
  2033	---N---
  2034	
  2035	
  2036	
  2037	NAK - This control character (CTRL-U) is sometimes used by commu-
  2038	nications or BBS programs (usually in file transfers) to indicate 
  2039	that the information it received was bad.  NAK stands for Nega-
  2040	tive AcKnowledgement.  [See also ACK].
  2041	
  2042	negotiation scheme - See feature negotiation.
  2043	
  2044	network - A group of BBS's that are "linked" together.  This
  2045	means that the BBS's share messages and sometimes files.  Usually
  2046	the BBS's will call each other late at night to get the messages
  2047	and files.  [See also echomail].
  2048	
  2049	new user - When you use a BBS, usually you will have the status
  2050	of new user for the first few calls, until the SysOp verifies
  2051	your account (at which time you will normally be considered a
  2052	registered user).  A new user usually has less privileges, such
  2053	as not being able to download programs.
  2054	
  2055	news - Some BBS programs will have announcements that are shown 
  2056	when you log on to the BBS.  These are often referred to as news, 
  2057	since they often inform you of changes to the BBS.  [Same as 
  2058	system news].  [See also sign-on message].
  2059	
  2060	next - A command in BBS programs that will let you view the next 
  2061	message in the message base.
  2062	
  2063	node - See line.
  2064	
  2065	noise - See line noise.
  2066	
  2067	noise level - See noise power.
  2068	
  2069	noise power - The "loudness" or strength of noise on a phone 
  2070	line.  It is measured in -dBm's.  [See also signal power].
  2071	
  2072	non-destructive backspace - This is when a communications program 
  2073	will not delete any characters on the screen when the backspace 
  2074	key is pressed.  [See also destructive backspace].
  2075	
  2076	non-volatile memory - This is memory that many modems have which 
  2077	is not destroyed when the power is turned off.  Using this memo-
  2078	ry, you can store a certain configuration in the memory, and have 
  2079	the modem automatically use the configuration when you turn it 
  2080	on.
  2081	
  2082	normal mode - See MNP normal mode.
  2083	
  2084	null character - The ASCII character 0, or CTRL-@.  This charac-
  2085	ter usually will not be printed on the screen.  It was originally 
  2086	used when communications programs were slower and could not 
  2087	receive information as fast as it was sent, so BBS programs would 
  2088	send these characters after every line to slow down the speed at 
  2089	which information had to be received.
  2090	
  2091	null modem - A special connection between two computers that will 
  2092	make the computers think that they are hooked up to a modem, so 
  2093	that the two computers can communicate with each other.
  2094	
  2095	numeric result codes - These are result codes that are printed as 
  2096	numbers, rather than words.  [See also result codes, verbal 
  2097	result codes].
  2098	
  2099	
  2100	
  2101	---O---
  2102	
  2103	
  2104	
  2105	odd parity - This indicates that the parity bit is always set so 
  2106	that the sum of the bits set to 1 in a byte, plus the parity bit, 
  2107	is an odd number.  [See also parity, format].
  2108	
  2109	off hook - The state that your telephone is in when you pick it 
  2110	up.  In non-computer life, it usually means when the telephone 
  2111	connection is accidentally disconnected, such as "Someone must 
  2112	have left the phone off the hook."  A modem that takes the phone 
  2113	"off hook" is taking control of the phone line, and it will 
  2114	usually then dial a phone number for you.  When a telephone line 
  2115	is "off hook," you are not able to receive calls from other 
  2116	people, unless you have call waiting.  [See also on hook].
  2117	
  2118	off hook button - This is the button on a real telephone that is 
  2119	depressed when you put down the receiver.  It signals the phone 
  2120	company when your phone is off hook, and ready to place calls.
  2121	
  2122	off line - When your computer is not connected to another BBS.  
  2123	[See also on line].
  2124	
  2125	on hook - When your telephone is not being used, and it is ready 
  2126	to ring if someone calls.  [See also off hook].
  2127	
  2128	on-line - When your computer is connected to a BBS.  For example, 
  2129	some communications programs will keep track of how long you have 
  2130	been on line.  This lets you know how long you have been connect-
  2131	ed to the BBS.
  2132	
  2133	on-line conference - This is when a group of people "get togeth-
  2134	er" and have a conference using their computers.  Some of the 
  2135	major on-line services do this.  [Same as real-time conference].
  2136	
  2137	on-line games - Any game that is played on a BBS.  Sometimes they 
  2138	are played in real time against other players who are using the 
  2139	BBS at the same time, and sometimes they are played by making a 
  2140	move and waiting for their opponent(s) to make their move when 
  2141	they next call.  [See also Role Playing Game].
  2142	
  2143	on-line information service - Any on-line service that provides 
  2144	information.  Most commercial systems fall into this category.  
  2145	[See also on-line service].
  2146	
  2147	on-line mode - See data mode.
  2148	
  2149	on-line service - While this can refer to any computer that is 
  2150	hooked up to the phone line, it usually means a pay service such 
  2151	as Compuserve or GEnie.  [Same as on-line system].  [See also 
  2152	on-line information service].
  2153	
  2154	on-line system - See on-line service.
  2155	
  2156	originate - To call another computer and connect to it.  The 
  2157	originating computer is the one that placed the telephone call 
  2158	(as opposed to the BBS, which is the answering computer).
  2159	
  2160	originate-only modems - Some older modems only operate using an 
  2161	originate frequency, which means that if you try calling one, you 
  2162	must change your modem to send an answer tone.  This can be done 
  2163	on many modems by typing ATDT, the phone number you want to call, 
  2164	and then the letter R (before hitting return).
  2165	
  2166	originating computer - The computer which dials another computer.
  2167	This is most likely referring to your computer (unless you have a
  2168	BBS, or other people are calling your phone number, and you have
  2169	your computer's modem answer the phone).  [See also answering
  2170	computer].
  2171	
  2172	originate frequency - This is the frequency of the carrier that
  2173	is used by the modem that places a call to another modem.  [See
  2174	also answer frequency].
  2175	
  2176	originate mode - This is when a modem is ready to place a call,
  2177	rather than accept an incoming call.  [See also answer mode].
  2178	
  2179	
  2180	
  2181	---P---
  2182	
  2183	
  2184

  2186	of information.  [2] A group of bytes sent by a file transfer
  2187	protocol.
  2188	
  2189	packet switching network - A telecommunications service that 
  2190	transmits data from one computer to another using packets of 
  2191	data.  They usually have telephone numbers in most areas of the 
  2192	country so that users can connect to on-line services without 
  2193	toll charges.
  2194	
  2195	pad - This happens when a file that is being transferred ends in
  2196	the middle of a block of data.  The communications program must
  2197	add blank data to fill up the block.  This is called padding.
  2198	[See also protocol].
  2199	
  2200	PAD - Packet Assembler/Disassembler.  This is a device that 
  2201	disassembles incoming packets, and assembles outgoing packets.
  2202	
  2203	page - [1] (noun) A page is one screen's worth of information.  
  2204	Many BBS's will automatically wait for you to press a key after 
  2205	it has sent you a page of information. [2] (verb) to alert the 
  2206	SysOp that you would like to speak with him.  Many BBS's will 
  2207	allow you to do this, and it will make beeping sounds so that the 
  2208	SysOp will know you want to talk to him.  [Same as yell].  [See 
  2209	also chat].
  2210	
  2211	PAK - [1] The extension for files archived with the program of
  2212	the same name.  You need the program PAK to un-arc an archive
  2213	with this extension.  [2] The program itself.  [See also archive,
  2214	unarchive].
  2215	
  2216	parallel - This is when a computer sends data one byte (or any
  2217	number of bits other than one) at a time.  This is faster than
  2218	the alternative, serial.  [See also serial].
  2219	
  2220	parallel interface - Any interface that transmits or receives 
  2221	more than one bit at a time.  In most cases, 8 bits are trans-
  2222	ferred at a time.  The RS-232C standard involves a parallel 
  2223	interface.  [See also serial interface].
  2224	
  2225	parity bit - Most modems have the capability to send an extra bit 
  2226	for every byte sent, which is used to help sense errors.  This is 
  2227	called the parity bit.  It can be set to no parity, mark parity, 
  2228	space parity, odd parity or even parity.  Most BBS's do not use a 
  2229	parity bit.  [See also format, mark, space, odd, even].
  2230	
  2231	password - A special code that only you should know.  This code 
  2232	will allow you to gain access to your account on a computer.  
  2233	Different BBS's have different rules as to how long your password 
  2234	can be and what characters can be used.  You should not use a 
  2235	password that is easy to guess (such as your name, or 
  2236	"password"), because a hacker might try to gain access to your 
  2237	account by guessing your password.
  2238	
  2239	pause - On most modems, you can send the modem a command that
  2240	will pause at some point while dialing a number.  This can be
  2241	useful on PBX systems, if you have to wait for a dial tone.
  2242	
  2243	PBX - Private Branch Exchange.  This is the telephone system that 
  2244	many offices have, allowing extensions for each telephone, and a 
  2245	connection to the main telephone system.
  2246	
  2247	PC-Pursuit - A packet switching network that allows people to 
  2248	save money on long distance calling, if they use modems.
  2249	
  2250	phase shift keying - See PSK.
  2251	
  2252	phone number - A number identifying a specific phone line.  In 
  2253	the United States, a phone number consists of a 3 digit area code 
  2254	and a 7 digit number.  If you call BBS's in other countries, 
  2255	there may be a specific country code and city code that is part 
  2256	of the phone number.  You can find many of these codes in a phone 
  2257	book.  A BBS will usually ask you to tell it your phone number 
  2258	before you can be a registered user.
  2259	
  2260	phreaker - A person who spends a lot of time trying to find out 
  2261	as much as possible about the telephone company, and how it 
  2262	works.  They often try to find out ways to make long distance 
  2263	calls for free.  Some steal calls from telephone credit card 
  2264	users, some steal calls from the phone company directly, and 
  2265	others don't make "free" long distance calls.  They are sometimes 
  2266	confused with hackers.  [See also hacker].
  2267	
  2268	pick up - To pick up a carrier is when the 2 modems recognize 
  2269	each other's signals over a phone line.  After this point the two 
  2270	computers can communicate.
  2271	
  2272	ping-pong - A 9600bps and 4800bps protocol developed by Hayes.  
  2273	It features fast turnaround.
  2274	
  2275	pins - The ports on the back of your computer and an external 
  2276	modem will have pins.  Each pin has a certain function, such as 
  2277	letting the computer know that the modem is online.  The pins 
  2278	from a computer's port and the modem are connected by a cable.
  2279	
  2280	PKARC - The program which will make an archive with the extension 
  2281	"ARC".  [See also archive, unarchive, ARC].
  2282	
  2283	PKUNZIP - The program which will un-arc a file that has the 
  2284	extension ZIP.  [See also unarchive, archive, ZIP].

  2287	PKARC.  [See also unarchive, archive, ARC].
  2288	
  2289	PKZIP - The program which will create an archive with the exten-
  2290	sion "ZIP".  It is one of the most popular archive programs.  
  2291	[See also archive, unarchive, ZIP].
  2292	
  2293	pocket modem - An external modem that is small enough to be 
  2294	easily portable.  It usually either uses a battery for power, or 
  2295	it can get its power from the phone line.
  2296	
  2297	poll - [verb] The process when a computer checks to see whether a 
  2298	peripheral or another computer has data to send.  [noun] See 
  2299	vote.
  2300	
  2301	post - To save a message that you have written on a BBS so that 
  2302	other people can see it.  [Same as leave message].
  2303	
  2304	private - When referring to a message, it means that only a
  2305	specific person or several people that you specify can view the
  2306	message.  [See also public].
  2307	
  2308	private branch exchange - See PBX.
  2309	
  2310	private line - See leased line.
  2311	
  2312	privileged - Some BBS's have a privileged user level, where the 
  2313	user can do more than a regular user.  For example, they may be 
  2314	able to download more programs than regular users.  [See also 
  2315	user level].
  2316	
  2317	profanity filter - Some BBS's have a special function that will 
  2318	take out specified words (usually swears) from messages that 
  2319	people leave.  That way, the BBS will automatically keep itself 
  2320	"clean," even if users try to leave swears in their messages.
  2321	
  2322	prompt - A character or group of characters that are meant to 
  2323	remind the user of a BBS that he needs to enter some information.  
  2324	It might say "What now?" or it might list the name of the message 
  2325	base the user is currently in, or a list of possible commands.
  2326	
  2327	protocol - [1] When referring to file transfers, a protocol is a 
  2328	method of sending and receiving a program.  There are many meth-
  2329	ods available, each with different advantages and disadvantages.  
  2330	[See also upload, download, Xmodem, Ymodem, Zmodem, Kermit].  [2] 
  2331	Protocol is also used to describe the way that hardware error 
  2332	control is managed.  [See also error control].
  2333	
  2334	PSK - Phase Shift Keying.  In this method of modulation/demodula-
  2335	tion, there are two frequencies used (usually 1200 hertz and 2400 
  2336	hertz).  There are 4 different phase angles (0, 90, 180, and 270 
  2337	degrees), representing dibits 00, 01, 10, and 11.  This is usual-
  2338	ly used for 1200bps transmission.  Note that the baud rate using 
  2339	PSK is really 1/2 of the bps rate, since 2 bits are sent at a 
  2340	time instead of one.  [See also modulation].
  2341	
  2342	PSTN - Public Switched Telephone Network.  This is the regular 
  2343	phone lines that just about everybody uses.
  2344	
  2345	public - When referring to a message, it means that the message 
  2346	is available for everyone to see.  [See also private].
  2347	
  2348	public domain - A program that is in the public domain usually 
  2349	has no copyright, and can be copied legally by anybody.  BBS's 
  2350	often have public domain software available for people to down-
  2351	load.  [See also shareware, freeware, commercial software, ban-
  2352	nerware].
  2353	
  2354	public messaging - A fancy term that means to read and/or leave
  2355	messages in a message base.
  2356	
  2357	public switched telephone network - See PSTN.
  2358	
  2359	pulse dialing - A method that some phones use to dial numbers.
  2360	It involves a series of "clicks."  Most modems support this type
  2361	of dialing, which is the only type available in some remote
  2362	areas.  The other method of dialing is tone dialing.  [See also
  2363	tone dialing].
  2364	
  2365	
  2366	
  2367	---Q---
  2368	
  2369	
  2370	
  2371	quickscan - An option used by some bulletin board programs which 
  2372	will let you check several message bases to see if there are any 
  2373	new messages.  [See also global scan].
  2374	
  2375	quit - See logoff.
  2376	
  2377	
  2378	
  2379	---R---
  2380	
  2381	
  2382	
  2383	rack mounted modems - Some multi-line BBS's use rack mounted
  2384	modems, so that the modems can be easily and safely stored.
  2385	
  2386	raw speed - The speed at which a modem can actually transmit 
  2387	data, before compression or other factors.  [See also effective 
  2388	transfer rate].
  2389	
  2390	RD - Receive Data.  This is the wire in an RS-232C cable that
  2391	receives data.
  2392	
  2393	real-time conference - See on-line conference.
  2394	
  2395	receive - To transfer information from another computer to your
  2396	computer.  To receive a file is the same as downloading the file.
  2397	[See also send].
  2398	
  2399	receive data LED - On external modems, this LED will light up 
  2400	when the modem is receiving data.  [See also LED indicators].
  2401	
  2402	receive level - The "loudness" of the sound that is received by a 
  2403	modem.  It is measured in -dBm's.  A modem will have a certain 
  2404	range which it can understand, for example, -33dBm to -9dBm.  
  2405	[See also equalization].
  2406	
  2407	receive sensitivity - See carrier detect threshold.
  2408	
  2409	register - A location in memory that stores a value which refers 
  2410	to something specific.  This value can be changed.  For example, 
  2411	most modems have a register that holds a number which tells the 
  2412	modem how many rings it should wait for before picking up the 
  2413	phone.
  2414	
  2415	registered user - This is the most common user level on most 
  2416	BBS's.  It usually allows reasonable usage of the BBS (perhaps it 
  2417	will give you a time limit of 45 minutes per day, and let you 
  2418	download up to 200K of programs per day).  [Same as regular 
  2419	user].  [See also user level].
  2420	
  2421	regular user - See registered user.
  2422	
  2423	reliable link - A connection that is "error-free," meaning that 
  2424	an error control protocol is being used.  [See also auto-reliable 
  2425	link].
  2426	
  2427	remote - A computer in a different location.  For a BBS, the user 
  2428	is at a remote location (since they are connected by the phone 
  2429	line, and not right there).  For a user, the BBS is at a remote 
  2430	location.
  2431	
  2432	request to send - See RTS.
  2433	
  2434	reread - After a message is sent to your computer from a BBS, the 
  2435	reread command will send the message again.  This can be useful 
  2436	if the message is long, and you miss part of it.
  2437	
  2438	reset - A modem can be reset.  This will change any options (such
  2439	as parity and speed) to the values that they have when the modem
  2440	is first used.  This can be useful if you change some values for
  2441	the modem and aren't sure what they do, and then you find that 
  2442	the modem won't work.  Resetting the modem will fix everything 
  2443	for you.
  2444	
  2445	response format - The way that a modem sends certain information 
  2446	to the computer.  It can either be verbal (such as "BUSY" or "NO 
  2447	CARRIER"), or it can be numeric ("7" or "3").
  2448	
  2449	response time - How long it takes for the computer or modem to 
  2450	respond to a certain condition.  For example, a carrier detect 
  2451	response time of 10ms means that it takes the modem 10 millisec-
  2452	onds to figure out that there is a carrier.
  2453	
  2454	result codes - These are either numbers or words that the modem 
  2455	sends to the communications program (which will usually print 
  2456	them on the screen for you to see) that indicate how the modem 
  2457	responded to an action you requested.  For example, if you tell 
  2458	the modem to dial a number, it may respond with "CONNECT 1200", 
  2459	which is a result code that means that the computer dialed the 
  2460	number and connected to a computer on the other end.  [See also 
  2461	numeric result codes, verbal result codes].
  2462	
  2463	retrain - Some modems have the capability of monitoring the phone 
  2464	line to "see" how good the connection is.  If the line quality is 
  2465	poor, these modems can "retrain"--they change their equalization 
  2466	so as to better accommodate the lines.  [See also equalization].
  2467	
  2468	retransmit - To transmit information that was previously sent.  
  2469	Whenever an error is encountered, retransmitting the data will 
  2470	fix the problem.
  2471	
  2472	return - ASCII character 13.  This is the key marked "RETURN" or 
  2473	"ENTER".  It will advance the cursor to the next line.  On some 
  2474	printers, it will just move the print head to the left hand side, 
  2475	and the printer then needs a linefeed to move to the next line.  
  2476	[Same as carriage return, <CR>].
  2477	
  2478	reverse - When you are in a message base, you may find this 
  2479	command which will allow you to read messages is backwards order 
  2480	(from newest to oldest messages).
  2481	
  2482	reverse mode - When a modem switches the signals it should send.  
  2483	For example, in reverse mode, a modem that dials another computer 
  2484	will act as though it just received the call.  Some modems only 
  2485	let you dial out (they do not accept calls).  In order to call 
  2486	one of these modems, you would have to set your modem to reverse 
  2487	mode, and then call the computer.
  2488	
  2489	RI signal - See ring indicator signal.
  2490	
  2491	right brace - The character }.
  2492	
  2493	right bracket - The character ].
  2494	
  2495	ring - When someone calls you on the telephone, the sound that
  2496	your phone makes is called a "ring."  Also, when you call someone
  2497	(or a computer), it will ring before they pick it up.  This
  2498	indicates that the number is not busy, but nobody has picked up
  2499	the phone yet.
  2500	
  2501	ringback - The sound that you hear over the phone that indicates
  2502	that the phone is ringing on the other end, and not busy.  It
  2503	sounds a lot like a phone actually ringing.
  2504	
  2505	ringing indicator LED - This is an LED on some external modems 
  2506	that lights up when the phone is ringing.  [See also LED indica-
  2507	tors].
  2508	
  2509	ring indicator signal - This is the line on an RS-232C cable that 
  2510	indicates that the phone is ringing.
  2511	
  2512	RJ-11 - This is a normal phone jack.  Modems usually have 2 jacks
  2513	like this, one to connect to the phone line, and the other to
  2514	connect to a telephone (that you can use when the modem isn't
  2515	being used).
  2516	
  2517	RPG - See Role Playing Game
  2518	
  2519	Role Playing Game - Some computers don't act as places to leave 
  2520	messages or programs, but instead let you play a game.  On these 
  2521	computers, you have a character and call up the computer to move 
  2522	around in a world with other characters (other people who call 
  2523	up), and you interact with them (for example, you may try to kill 
  2524	the character).  [Same as RPG].  [See also on-line games].
  2525	
  2526	rotary - A phone that dials with the pulse method.  [See also
  2527	pulse dialing, tone dialing].
  2528	
  2529	RS-232 - The name of a specific type of port on the back of some 
  2530	computers, or peripherals such as modems.  It has 9 or 25 pins.  
  2531	[See also RS-232C].
  2532	
  2533	RS-232C - The name of a standard (created by the Electronics 
  2534	Industry Association) for communication between a computer and a 
  2535	serial device.  The interface consists of 25 wires, although a 
  2536	variation contains 9 wires.  Computers and peripherals which both 
  2537	have an RS-232 port can be connected easily with an RS-232C 
  2538	cable.
  2539	
  2540	running - Working.  If a BBS is running, then it is working 
  2541	correctly and people can call it.  [See also down].
  2542	
  2543	RTS - Request To Send.  This is when the computer tells the modem
  2544	that it wants to send information to the other computer.  It is
  2545	only used in half duplex mode.  [See also flow control, CTS].
  2546	
  2547	
  2548	
  2549	---S---
  2550	
  2551	
  2552	
  2553	S register - A type of register that modems use.  [See also 
  2554	register].
  2555	
  2556	scan - To look through messages or file descriptions to either 
  2557	find new messages or files or look for certain key words within 
  2558	the messages or descriptions.
  2559	
  2560	screen width - The number of characters that a computer can  
  2561	display on one line.  On most modern computers, it is 80 columns.  
  2562	[Same as video width].  [See also columns].
  2563	
  2564	script language - Many communications programs allow the user to 
  2565	write a program, or script, which allows them to use the communi-
  2566	cations program without actually typing anything.  It is often 
  2567	used to call BBS's late at night to download programs or look for 
  2568	new messages.  This way, the user does not have to be there when 
  2569	the communications takes place.
  2570	
  2571	scripting language - See script language.
  2572	
  2573	sector - A unit to measure storage space.  It usually refers to 
  2574	256 bytes.  It is rarely used any more.
  2575	
  2576	security level - Some BBS programs have different user levels, 
  2577	usually numbered, which allow different levels of access.  For 
  2578	example, 0 might refer to an unregistered user, 10 a registered 
  2579	user, and 99 for the SysOp.  Each has different levels of access 
  2580	on the BBS.  [Similar to user level].
  2581	
  2582	selectable COM ports - On internal modems for IBM compatible 
  2583	computers, this allows you to change something on the modem 
  2584	(usually a jumper or DIP switch) to allow you to change which COM 
  2585	port the modem will be connected to.  [See also COM port, jumper, 
  2586	DIP switch].
  2587	
  2588	selftest - The ability of a modem to test itself to make sure it 
  2589	is functioning properly.
  2590	
  2591	send - To transfer information from one computer to another.  To 
  2592	send a file is called uploading the file.  [See also receive].

  2595	
  2596	serial - The method used when a computer sends and receives data 
  2597	one bit at a time.  Contrast this to parallel.  [See also paral-
  2598	lel].

  2616	
  2617	shareware - Programs that can be distributed freely, but you must 
  2618	pay for these programs if you use them.  They usually allow you 
  2619	to try them for a specified period of time and then you must 
  2620	either pay for the program or get rid of it.  Many BBS's have 
  2621	shareware programs that you can download without paying the BBS, 
  2622	but you must remember that if you use a shareware program you are 
  2623	supposed to pay for it.  [See also public domain].
  2624	
  2625	shell virus - A virus which places itself either before or after 
  2626	a program on a disk or in memory.  It can be easy to detect such 
  2627	a virus, since the length of the program will be longer after the 
  2628	virus hits than it was before.  [See also virus].
  2629	
  2630	SIG - Special Interest Group.  This is similar to a message base,
  2631	but it may also contain files.  It is generally used on large
  2632	services, such as CompuServe.  [See also SIGop].

  2645	the next user to call the BBS.
  2646	
  2647	sign-on - The procedure of letting a BBS know who you are.  This 
  2648	involves giving the computer information such as you user number, 
  2649	name, password, and sometimes even phone number.  [See also 
  2650	logon].
  2651	
  2652	sign-on message - A message that is displayed by a BBS after you 
  2653	sign on.  Often news about the BBS will go here.  On some BBS's

  2676	modem speeds are 300bps, 1200bps, 2400bps, and 9600bps.  [See 
  2677	also effective transfer rate].
  2678	
  2679	stand-alone modem - See external modem.
  2680	
  2681	stand-alone program - A program, usually that allows you to do 
  2682	file transfers, that is separate from your comm program, but can 
  2683	be called by it.
  2684	
  2685	start bit - This framing bit indicates that the data byte will be 
  2686	following.  It is always a binary 0.  [See also format, framing 
  2687	bits].
  2688	
  2689	statistics - Any information that a BBS keeps on its users.  Some 
  2690	BBS's keep track of how many messages a user posts, how many 
  2691	programs the user uploads or downloads, and even how many times 
  2692	the user calls.
  2693	
  2694	stats - See statistics.
  2695	
  2696	status line - In communications programs, sometimes the bottom 
  2697	line of the screen will contain a status line, which has informa-
  2698	tion such as the speed of the modem, the parity, how long you 
  2699	have been connected to a BBS and other such information.
  2700	
  2701	status lights - See LED indicators. 
  2702	
  2703	stop bit - When a modem sends a byte of data, it usually sends 
  2704	one or two framing bits after the data byte, before the next byte 
  2705	is sent.  These bit(s) are called stop bits.  They are always a 
  2706	binary 1.  [See also format, framing bits].
  2707	
  2708	streaming - When a file transfer protocol sends data continuous-
  2709	ly, without waiting to make sure there are no errors.  A stream-
  2710	ing protocol should check for errors, but if an error occurs the 
  2711	file transfer should be stopped.  A streaming protocol should 
  2712	only be used with modems that have hardware error control.  [See 
  2713	also Ymodem-g, protocol].  [Same as full flow].
  2714	
  2715	streaming Ymodem - See Ymodem-g.

  2721	subboard - See message base.
  2722	
  2723	subject - Most BBS's require that you leave a short description
  2724	about any messages that you post on the BBS.  This description is
  2725	referred to as the subject of the message.  [Same as title].
  2726	
  2727	subop - A term used for the operator of a subboard.  Some BBS's 
  2728	allow a person besides the SysOp to control a specific message 
  2729	base.  This person would be able to kill any messages that he/she 
  2730	felt were inappropriate.
  2731	
  2732	synchronous communication - With synchronous communication, data 
  2733	bytes are not marked with a beginning and end, but instead are 
  2734	sent at a specific interval.  When computers send data to modems, 
  2735	it is synchronous communication.  When modems send the informa-
  2736	tion they get from the computer, the modem usually will add start 
  2737	and stop bits to identify the bytes.  That is asynchronous commu-
  2738	nication.  [See also asynchronous communication].
  2739	
  2740	SysOp - Short for SYStems OPerator.  This is the person who is in
  2741	charge of a BBS.  He has the power to change anyone's user level,
  2742	delete users, delete or edit messages.  Usually this is the same
  2743	person who paid for the BBS equipment and pays for the phone
  2744	line.  [See also Co-SysOp].
  2745	
  2746	SysOp window - Some BBS programs have an area of the computer 
  2747	screen (on the computer that the BBS runs on, not the user's 
  2748	screen) that gives information about the user who is on-line, 
  2749	such as his password, where he is from and his phone number.  
  2750	This is called the SysOp window, and is for the convenience of 
  2751	the SysOp.  [Similar to top of screen display].
  2752	
  2753	system - [1] Your computer.  When a BBS asks for your system 
  2754	configuration, it is referring to information about your comput-
  2755	er, such as screen width.  [2] A BBS.
  2756	
  2757	system files - Any computer files that are used by an operating
  2758	system, or in the case of BBS's, files that are used by the BBS
  2759	program that do not get changed.

  2769	tab - The key on your keyboard that will move the cursor forward
  2770	about 5 spaces.  It is not an ASCII character (it is similar to a
  2771	function key, since it does not output a single character).
  2772	
  2773	talk mode - See voice mode.
  2774	
  2775	TCM - Trellis Coded Modulation.  This is a form of error control

  2784	
  2785	telecommunication(s) - This word has no precise definition, but 
  2786	is frequently used.  Its definition ranges from "any form of 
  2787	communication over a distance" to "any communication by electric 
  2788	means" to "two computers 'talking' to each other via modems."  
  2789	Methods of communications that probably are considered telecommu-
  2790	nications: BBS's, telephones, TV's and fax machines.  The word is 
  2791	used both in singular and plural.
  2792	
  2793	telecommuting - The idea of company employees working from home, 
  2794	rather than their office.  At home, they can communicate with the 
  2795	office (and other entities) by modem or voice calls.
  2796	
  2797	telecomputing - Using computers to communicate.  This usually 
  2798	involves using modems to communicate over the phone lines, but 
  2799	can also involve other media such as the air waves.
  2800	
  2801	Telenet - The packet-switched network that is used for PC-Pur-
  2802	suit, which is operated by U.S. Sprint.

  2808	
  2809	terminal emulation - When a communications program can simulate 
  2810	the operations of a smart terminal.
  2811	
  2812	terminal mode - Some modems have a built in terminal program.  On 
  2813	these modems, if that program is running, the modem is said to be 
  2814	in its terminal mode.  It also refers to the state where a modem 
  2815	is ready to accept commands, although command mode is the pre-
  2816	ferred term.
  2817	
  2818	terminal program - A program that allows a person to use a modem.  
  2819	It is generally very limited.  A communications program is a more 
  2820	advanced version of a terminal program.  Usually a terminal 
  2821	program will simulate a specific brand of terminal.  It generally 
  2822	does not support file transfers.  [Also called term program].
  2823	
  2824	terminate - To disconnect with another computer.  This is some-
  2825	times listed as a command in menus on BBS's.
  2826	
  2827	text file - Any information that can be read, and is stored in a 
  2828	computer file.  A text file can be any kind of information, such 
  2829	as a description of a computer program.

  2831	thread - A group of related messages on a BBS, within the same 
  2832	message base.  If a user posts a reply to a message, some BBS's 
  2833	will start a thread.  If a message is part of a thread, the BBS 
  2834	will have a command so that you can see the original message, 
  2835	which started the thread.
  2836	
  2837	throughput - See effective transfer rate.
  2838	
  2839	tilde - The character ~.
  2840	
  2841	time limit - Most BBS's have a time limit, where you can only be 
  2842	on the BBS for a certain amount of time.  On some BBS's you can 
  2843	only be on for a certain amount of time each time you call, on 
  2844	others there is a limit of time that you can be on the BBS per 
  2845	day.
  2846	
  2847	time out - BBS programs often will disconnect a user if he
  2848	doesn't type anything for a certain amount of time.  Time out
  2849	occurs when the time limit is reached and the BBS program hangs
  2850	up on the user.  This is done so that users do not tie up the
  2851	BBS.  If a user is connected to the BBS but is not using it, 
  2852	other callers might not be able to use the BBS.
  2853	
  2854	timing signal - A signal sometimes sent by modems over the phone 
  2855	line that lets the receiving modem know when a byte of informa-
  2856	tion starts.  It is required in synchronous communication.
  2857	
  2858	title - See subject.
  2859	
  2860	tone dialing - This is a method that a phone or modem can use to 
  2861	dial a phone number.  It uses one audible tone per digit to be 
  2862	dialed.  [See also pulse dialing].
  2863	
  2864	top of screen display - Some BBS's have this display on the top 
  2865	of the screen of the computer running the BBS.  This will show 
  2866	the SysOp certain information about the user who is on-line, such 
  2867	as his phone number, how many programs he has downloaded, etc.  
  2868	[Similar to SysOp window].
  2869	
  2870	touchtone dialing speed - The length of time that your modem 
  2871	sends each touchtone digit over the phone lines.  It is the 
  2872	equivalent to the length of time that you hold down the buttons 
  2873	on a phone when you make a call.
  2874	
  2875	transfer - To send a computer program from one computer to anoth-
  2876	er.  [See also download, upload, protocol].
  2877	
  2878	transfer protocol - See protocol.
  2879	
  2880	transmission rate - See data transmission rate.
  2881	
  2882	transmission speed - See data transmission rate.
  2883	
  2884	transmit data LED - This is an LED on an external modem that will 
  2885	light when the modem is transmitting data over the phone line.  
  2886	[See also LED indicators].
  2887	
  2888	transmit level - The "loudness" level of the sound leaving a 
  2889	modem to go over the phone lines.  It is measured in -dBm's.  It 
  2890	should be different at different frequencies, since certain 
  2891	frequencies have more loss over the phone line than others.  [See 
  2892	also equalization].
  2893	
  2894	trapdoor - This usually refers to a BBS program (or a mainframe 
  2895	that you call up) that has a special code that can be entered to 
  2896	give you high access.  Usually, it is entered as a user name and 
  2897	password when logging on.  These are undocumented by the program, 
  2898	and usually were created by the programmers so that they could 
  2899	gain access to any computer running their BBS program.  Hackers 
  2900	try to find trapdoors, but they are usually not created by hack-
  2901	ers.  (Some other kinds of software have trapdoors, such as video 
  2902	games, which might have trapdoors to give you extra lives).
  2903	
  2904	Trellis-coded modulation - See TCM.
  2905

  2907	starts a macro.  [See also macro].
  2908	
  2909	trojan horse - A trojan horse is a program within another pro-
  2910	gram, usually on a mainframe or a computer running a BBS.  The 
  2911	original program looks innocent, but when run it will trigger the 
  2912	trojan horse, which will usually try to gain access to the main-
  2913	frame computer system or BBS.
  2914	
  2915	TTY - A TeleTYpe machine.  It is a keyboard and a printer com-
  2916	bined in one unit.  It is hooked up to another computer.
  2917	
  2918	TTY mode - This is when a communications program emulates a TTY 
  2919	machine, which only involves printing characters and recognizing 
  2920	the linefeed, carriage return and backspace characters.  [See 
  2921	also TTY].
  2922	
  2923	two-wire leased line - See leased line.
  2924	
  2925	Tymnet - A packet-switched network.
  2926	
  2927	type-ahead buffer - Some BBS programs let you type characters to 
  2928	the BBS, even while it is sending information to you.  When it is 
  2929	finished sending the information to you, it will then act on the 
  2930	information you sent.  The type-ahead buffer refers to the proc-
  2931	ess, and the space in the BBS computer's memory where the charac-
  2932	ters are held.
  2933	
  2934	
  2935

  2944	device in a computer or modem that will change serial data (the 
  2945	way data comes in over the phone line) to parallel, and vice 
  2946	versa.  [See also serial, parallel, 16550 UART, 8250 UART, 16450 
  2947	UART].

  2951	unarchive - To take out the files from an archive.  [Same as 
  2952	unarc].  [See also archive, extract, ARJ, ZIP, ARC, PAK, LZH].
  2953	
  2954	unattended mode - This mode is available on some communications 
  2955	programs.   It will let your computer wait for a telephone call 
  2956	from another computer, and will let the person using that comput-
  2957	er access your computer (usually to download or upload programs).  
  2958	It is called unattended because you don't have to wait for the 
  2959	person to call, the program will automatically answer when some-
  2960	one calls.  [See also attended mode].  [Similar to host program].
  2961	
  2962	underline character - The character _.
  2963	
  2964	underscore character - Any character (although almost always the
  2965	underline character) that is used for underlining.  When this
  2966	method is used, the text to be underlined will be sent (usually
  2967	to a printer), and then backspaces will be sent, and then the
  2968	underscore character will be printed over the text, so it looks
  2969	like it is underlined.
  2970	
  2971	upload - To send a program from your computer to a BBS.  [See 
  2972	also download, protocol].
  2973	
  2974	uppercase - Letters that are used for emphasis, as opposed to 
  2975	regular lowercase letters.  CAPITAL letters are the same as 
  2976	uppercase letters.  The first word in a sentence is in uppercase.  
  2977	Some older computers were only capable of displaying uppercase 
  2978	characters.
  2979	
  2980	user - A person who uses a BBS.  For example, a BBS might claim 
  2981	that it has 500 users, which means that there are 500 different 
  2982	people who have called the BBS.
  2983	
  2984	user level - The level of security which a user has.  This usual-
  2985	ly is in the form of word(s), usually progressing from: New User, 
  2986	Registered User, Privileged User, SysOp Level.  [See also securi-
  2987	ty level].
  2988	
  2989	user list - Most BBS programs will allow you to see a list of all 
  2990	its users.  It will show the user's name, and often city and 
  2991	state.  This is called the user list.  Rarely will it show any 
  2992	phone numbers or more detailed information.
  2993	
  2994	user log - A file on a computer running a BBS that lists which 
  2995	users called, what time they called, and sometimes information as 
  2996	to what they did while they were on the BBS.
  2997	
  2998	user name - This is the name that a person uses on a computer 
  2999	system.  Sometimes an alias is used, but it is more often the 
  3000	user's real name or a variation of it.  [See also alias].
  3001	
  3002	user number - A number that is used by some older BBS programs to 
  3003	keep track of users.  On these BBS's, a user would have to remem-
  3004	ber a specific number as well as his password.  Most BBS's now 
  3005	just use the person's user name instead, which is much easier for 
  3006	a user to remember.  [Same as account number, ID number].
  3007	
  3008	userfile - A file that a BBS program has that keeps track of all 
  3009	users of the BBS and their statistics.

  3040	9600bps.  It was created by CCITT.  It has provisions for fall-
  3041	back, if the line is too noisy.
  3042	
  3043	V.32bis - The international standard for 14,400 bps modems, 
  3044	created by CCITT.
  3045	
  3046	V.42 - A standard error control system created by CCITT that is 
  3047	in use on many 9600bps modems and some 2400bps modems.  It in-
  3048	cludes LAPM, as well as MNP 2-4.  [See also error control, V.42 
  3049	compatible, V.42 compliant].
  3050	
  3051	V.42 compatible - This is a modem that follows all the V.42 
  3052	specifications, except for LAPM error control (instead it uses 
  3053	MNP).  [See also V.42].
  3054	
  3055	V.42 compliant - This is a modem which follows all the V.42 
  3056	specifications, and uses LAPM error control if possible.  Other-
  3057	wise, it will go to MNP error control.  [See also V.42].
  3058	
  3059	V.42bis - A CCITT standard for data compression.  It can compress
  3060	data with about a 3:1 compression ratio, although it can compress
  3061	up to 4:1 given the right conditions.  Any modem with V.42bis
  3062	also has V.42 error control.  [See also data compression].
  3063	
  3064	verbal result codes - These are result codes which are printed as 
  3065	words, rather than numbers.  [See also result codes, numeric 
  3066	result codes].
  3067	
  3068	verify - This is when a SysOp makes sure that a new user is who 
  3069	he or she claims to be.  The normal procedure is for the SysOp to 
  3070	call up a new user, just to make sure that the phone number he 
  3071	listed is real.  This is a way to make sure that the users are 
  3072	less likely to abuse the system.  However, most SysOps do not 
  3073	call new users, since it is time consuming.  Some SysOps will 
  3074	look at the information the new user left just to make sure it 
  3075	"looks" right (if the new user says his phone number is 555-1212, 
  3076	the SysOp knows it is not real).  After verifying the user, the 
  3077	SysOp will usually raise the user's user level.
  3078	
  3079	verified user - Any user who has been verified by the SysOp.  It 
  3080	is also used to refer to users who have access better than that 
  3081	of new users.
  3082	
  3083	video width - See screen width.
  3084	
  3085	videotex - The idea of getting information by computer, over the
  3086	phone lines, and paying for it.  It is the computer version of
  3087	audiotex (900 numbers, voice mail, having computers call you).
  3088	
  3089	virus - Any program which spreads itself secretly.  It reproduces 
  3090	within a computer, and also will go to other computers if possi-
  3091	ble (through file transfers).  At a certain point in time, the 
  3092	virus will do something (anything from saying "Boo" to something 
  3093	destructive, such as erasing all files on a hard disk drive).  
  3094	They are often hidden inside legitimate programs that seem to run 
  3095	normally, but contain the virus.  It will usually spread to every 
  3096	program you run.  Viruses became widespread because BBS's can 
  3097	inadvertently spread virus all across the country.  Whenever you 
  3098	download a program, it might have a virus in it.  However, there 
  3099	are several programs available which find many viruses and can 
  3100	destroy them.
  3101	
  3102	voice detection - The ability of a modem to detect whether a
  3103	computer answers the phone, or whether it is a human voice.
  3104	
  3105	voice grade - A telephone line that is designed to transfer human 
  3106	voice.  This is the way most phone lines are set up.  However, 
  3107	the phone company also has data grade lines, which are supposed 
  3108	to make data communications better.  [See also data grade].
  3109	
  3110	voice mail - An addition to some modems.  This allows the modem 
  3111	to also answer incoming voice calls, send recorded (voice) mes-
  3112	sages to the caller, and let them leave a message.  [Same as 
  3113	answering machine].
  3114	
  3115	voice mode - Some older modems require the user to manually dial 
  3116	phone numbers through a telephone.  When this is done, the modem 
  3117	is in voice mode.  When the remote computer picks up the phone, 
  3118	the user must switch his modem from voice mode to data mode.  
  3119	[Same as talk mode].  [See also data mode].
  3120	
  3121	vote - Some BBS's have this feature, which allows the SysOp to 
  3122	find out user's preferences about things ranging from operation 
  3123	of the BBS to political positions.  It is similar to a survey in 
  3124	the non-computer world.  [Same as poll].
  3125	
  3126	VT100 - A smart terminal, which is emulated by many communica-
  3127	tions programs.  It uses ANSI codes.  [See also ANSI].
  3128	
  3129	VT52 - Another smart terminal, which is emulated by some communi-
  3130	cations programs.

  3135	
  3136	
  3137	
  3138	window - A distinct area of a computer screen that contains 
  3139	information different than the rest of the screen.  Sometimes it 
  3140	covers other information 'underneath' the window (in which case 
  3141	it is temporary), or it is permanent and does not contain other 
  3142	information.  [See also SysOp window].
  3143	
  3144	word wrap - A function of editors on BBS's (just like that found
  3145	in most word processors) which will move a word that won't fit at
  3146	the very right hand of the screen down to the next line.
  3147	
  3148	worm - A program which embeds itself within another program.  
  3149	Either it tries to find a space in which it won't be noticed, or 
  3150	it will just stick itself anywhere within the main program (which 
  3151	will ruin that program).  A worm is almost always destructive.  
  3152	[See also virus].
  3153	
  3154	
  3155	
  3156	---X---
  3157	
  3158	
  3159	
  3160	X.25 - This is a packet-switching protocol developed by CCITT.
  3161	It is used to carry large amounts of data at fast speeds over
  3162	leased phone lines.  [See also X.32].
  3163	
  3164	X.25 dialup - See X.32.
  3165	
  3166	X.32 - This is CCITT's 1984 update of X.25, also known as X.25 
  3167	dialup.  [See also X.25].
  3168	
  3169	X.400 - This is the CCITT standard protocol for a global system
  3170	for the exchange of electronic mail.
  3171	
  3172	X.500 - The CCITT standard for a directory of the users of the
  3173	X.400 system.  [See also X.400].
  3174	
  3175	xfer - Short for transfer.  It usually refers to file transfers.  
  3176	[See also upload, download].
  3177	
  3178	Xmodem - A file transfer protocol developed by Ward Christensen 
  3179	around 1977.  It is fairly slow by today's standards, but was the 
  3180	first widespread file transfer protocol.  It uses blocks of 128 
  3181	bytes, and after each block is sent, it sends a 1 byte checksum 
  3182	to check for errors.  If an error is encountered, the block will 
  3183	be re-sent.  Almost every communications program offers this 
  3184	protocol.  [Same as Christensen protocol].  [See also protocol].
  3185	
  3186	Xmodem/CRC - The same as Xmodem, but it has a 16-bit CRC instead 
  3187	of the checksum, which makes it more reliable (it catches more 
  3188	errors).  [See also protocol].
  3189	
  3190	Xmodem-1K - This is similar to Xmodem/CRC, except it uses blocks 
  3191	of 1024 bytes, rather than 128.  It is faster than Xmodem, since 
  3192	it needs to stop less often to check for errors.  This is some-
  3193	times incorrectly called Ymodem.  [See also protocol, Xmodem, 
  3194	Ymodem].
  3195	
  3196	Xoff - The CTRL-S character.  This is often used to pause infor-
  3197	mation that is being sent.  The information will be continued 
  3198	when an CTRL-Q is received.  [See also flow control, Xon].
  3199	
  3200	Xon - The CTRL-Q character.  This will sometimes continue paused 
  3201	information.  [See also flow control, Xoff].
  3202	
  3203	Xon/Xoff - The flow control method using the Xon and Xoff charac-
  3204	ters.  It is built into the software, not the hardware.  [See 
  3205	also Xon, Xoff, flow control].

  3212	
  3213	yell - See page (verb).
  3214	
  3215	Ymodem - A file transfer protocol which can transfer more than 
  3216	one file at a time.  It transfers both a file and some informa-
  3217	tion about the file (including its length, and the name of the 
  3218	file).  It is similar to Xmodem/CRC, except that Ymodem can 
  3219	transfer more than one file at a time.  It will use CRC-16 if 
  3220	possible, or else it will use a 1 byte checksum.  It will use 
  3221	both 1024 byte blocks and 128 byte blocks.  [See also protocol].
  3222	
  3223	Ymodem-g - This is Ymodem changed to provide best results with 
  3224	error-correcting modems.  Errors can be discovered by the proto-
  3225	col, since Ymodem-g uses CRC, but if there are any errors in the 
  3226	transmission, the transmission will be aborted.  [See also Ymo-
  3227	dem, protocol, streaming].  [Same as streaming Ymodem].
  3228	
  3229	
  3230	
  3231	---Z---
  3232	
  3233	
  3234	
  3235	ZIP - The file extension which refers to archives that were
  3236	created by the program PKZIP.  You need the program PKUNZIP to
  3237	get the files out of the archive.  [See also archive, unarchive,
  3238	PKZIP, PKUNZIP].
  3239	
  3240	Zmodem - A file transfer protocol which is known for its speed, 
  3241	as well as the ability to transfer information about the files 
  3242	which it sends.  It has crash recovery and auto-download fea-
  3243	tures, and can use a 32 bit CRC, which makes it almost error-
  3244	free.  [See also protocol].

  3265	                             HISTORY
  3266	
  3267	Telecommunications Dictionary version 0.99:
  3268	
  3269	     This was the first version available.  It was incomplete, 
  3270	with about 150 words, only covering A-K.  But it was nice for 
  3271	people not to have to wait another year to see part of it.  It 
  3272	was released in 1989.  It was usually in a file called 
  3273	"MODEMDIC".
  3274	
  3275	
  3276	Telecommunications Dictionary version 1.00:
  3277	
  3278	     This was the first real version.  It had somewhere around
  3279	430 words defined in it.  It was released on August 15, 1991.  It
  3280	was sent out originally as "TDIC100" in a ZIP compressed format.
  3281	
  3282	
  3283	Telecommunications Dictionary version 1.10:
  3284	
  3285	     This version had more than 530 words listed. Many words were 
  3286	added, some extra information was added to some old words, and 
  3287	several minor errors were corrected.  It was released on August 
  3288	22, 1991 (I was very busy that week!).  It should be called 
  3289	TDIC110.TXT, or if archived, TDIC110.ZIP (or whatever extension).
  3290	
  3291	
  3292	Telecommunications Dictionary version 1.20:
  3293	
  3294	     This version was not officially released.  It was an interim 
  3295	version.  It updated about half the definitions existing in 
  3296	version 1.10, and minor inconsistencies were fixed.  Also, a few 
  3297	words were added.
  3298	
  3299	Telecommunications Dictionary version 1.21:
  3300	
  3301	     Another interim version, not officially released.  Last 
  3302	modification in August, 1992.
  3303	
  3304	The Modem Dictionary version 1.25:
  3305	
  3306	     An interim version, just before 1.30.  The name was changed, 
  3307	since the dictionary is specific to modems, just a small portion 
  3308	of telecommunications.
  3309	
  3310	The Modem Dictionary, version 1.30:
  3311	
  3312	     This version was widely distributed, and contains all of the 
  3313	improvements found in the previous, unreleased versions.  It was 
  3314	marketed as shareware on a trial basis.  This version is on file 
  3315	at the United States Copyright Office, in Washington.
  3316	
  3317	The Modem Dictionary, version 1.50:
  3318	
  3319	     The current version.  The main change is that is was changed 
  3320	back to freeware.  It will remain that way.  
  3321
