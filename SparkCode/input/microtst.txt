     1	(Phoenix, Arizona, February 11, 1992)--Computing in the nineties is
     2	changing fast. With more and more organizations increasing their reliance
     3	on Local Area Networks (LANs), the expanding popularity of notebook and
     4	laptop computers, and the growing trend toward telecommuting, effective
     5	computing no longer just means a PC on your desk in the office.
     6	
     7	LANs are taking over the way businesses compute. Studies indicate that
     8	56.8% of all PCs in use will be connected to a LAN by 1995. International
     9	Data Corporation (IDC) predicts the demand for LAN-based dial out will
    10	increase as the number of PCs on LANs worldwide increases.
    11	
    12	In addition IDC states that, "the number of portable PCs (including
    13	notebooks, laptops, and transportables) shipping worldwide will increase
    14	from 3.9 million in 1991 to 9.6 million in 1995." With this growth in the
    15	portable PC market comes an increasing need for remote access to the LAN.
    16	
    17	Market research firm, Link Resources, says 4.3 million company employees
    18	work at home now. That figure is expected to increase as companies
    19	continue to find that higher productivity and employee satisfaction are
    20	the positive results of their telecommuting policies.
    21	
    22	In response to all of these trends and growing user concern with the
    23	complexity of LAN-to-WAN connectivity, LANMODEM provides a simple
    24	solution. LANMODEM is a V.32bis/ V.42bis (14.4K baud modem with up to 4x
    25	data compression) network-attachable modem, which operates at speeds up to
    26	57.6K baud.
    27	
    28	It is an intelligent plug-and-play network modem designed to give users
    29	high speed access to, from and between Novell LANs. LANMODEM provides a
    30	direct connection to the LAN cabling, giving remote users the ability to
    31	log in to their office network from home, their hotel room, or wherever
    32	they may be. LANMODEM lets them run applications such as E-mail,
    33	groupware, word processing programs, graphics packages, etc., exactly as
    34	if they were attached directly to the network. Additionally, remote users
    35	can transfer files, print documents or..take remote control of a network
    36	PC.
    37	
    38	As the popularity of telecommuting increases, so does the need for
    39	realistic tools which permit employees to work efficiently and
    40	effectively, believes David Bolles, company founder and CEO, who designed
    41	LANMODEM with telecommuting in mind. "I think technology has a
    42	responsibility to attempt to solve some of our environmental problems.
    43	More and more, companies are willing to work with their employees to
    44	permit them to work out of their home. LANMODEM is their easy-to-use
    45	dial-in solution. Additionally it solves a need for employees traveling on
    46	business to access their office networks."
    47	
    48	LANMODEM attaches directly to the network and allows network users in the
    49	office to share modems to dial out to electronic information services. In
    50	addition, LANMODEM features an additional serial port permitting another
    51	modem to be attached, giving multiple users the ability to dial in and out
    52	simultaneously, avoiding the need for dedicated modems and extra
    53	telecommunications lines.
    54	
    55	LANMODEM, ($1,995 Ethernet Version), was announced late in 1991, and is
    56	currently in final beta testing. It will ship in March.
    57	
    58	Microtest Inc. designs, manufactures and markets innovative solutions for
    59	users of computer networks, pioneering several firsts in both network
    60	diagnostic and connectivity products. Since the introduction of Cable
    61	Scanner, the first hand-held cable testing tool, in 1988, Microtest's
    62	products have captured national recognition in the industry, including
    63	winning several "Product of the Year" awards. The LANPORT connectivity
    64	product line of dedicated applications servers, introduced in 1989, gave
    65	network users the ability for the first time to share printers and modems
    66	without a dedicated computer.
