    50	SHUTTLE ATLANTIS TO DEPLOY GALILEO PROBE TOWARD JUPITER
    51	
    52	
    53	     Space Shuttle mission STS-34 will deploy the Galileo planetary
    54	exploration spacecraft into low-Earth orbit starting Galileo on its journey
    55	to explore Jupiter.  Galileo will be the second planetary probe deployed
    56	from the Shuttle this year following Atlantis' successful launch of
    57	Magellan toward Venus exploration in May.
    58	
    59	     Following deployment about 6 hours after launch, Galileo will be
    60	propelled on a trajectory, known as Venus-Earth-Earth Gravity Assist
    61	(VEEGA) by an Air Force-developed, inertial upper stage (IUS).  Galileo's
    62	trajectory will swing around Venus, the sun and Earth before Galileo
    63	makes it's way toward Jupiter.
    64	
    65	     Flying the VEEGA track, Galileo will arrive at Venus in February 1990. 
    66	During the flyby, Galileo will make measurements to determine the
    67	presence of lightning on Venus and take time-lapse photography of Venus'
    68	cloud circulation patterns.  Accelerated by Venus' gravity, the spacecraft
    69	will head back to Earth.
    70	
    71	     Enroute, Galileo will activate onboard remote-sensing equipment to
    72	gather near-infrared data on the composition and characteristics of the
    73	far side of Earth's moon.  Galileo also will map the hydrogen distribution
    74	of the Earth's atmosphere.
    75	
    76	     Acquiring additional energy from the Earth's gravitational forces,
    77	Galileo will travel on a 2-year journey around the sun spending 10 months
    78	inside an asteroid belt.  On Oct. 29, 1991, Galileo wlll pass within 600
    79	miles of the asteroid Gaspra.
    80	
    81	     On the second Earth flyby in December 1992, Galileo will photograph
    82	the north pole of the moon in an effort to determine if ice exists. 
    83	Outbound, Galileo will activate the time-lapse photography system to
    84	produce a "movie" of the moon orbiting Earth.
    85	
    86	     Racing toward Jupiter, Galileo will make a second trek through the
    87	
    88	
    89	
    90	
    91	
    92	
    93	asteroid belt passing within 600 miles of asteroid Ida on Aug. 29, 1993. 
    94	Science data gathered from both asteroid encounters will focus on surface
    95	geology and composition.
    96	
    97	     Five months prior to the Dec. 7, 1995, arrival at Jupiter, Galileo's
    98	atmospheric probe, encased in an oval heat shield, will spin away from the
    99	orbiter at a rate of 5 revolutions per minute (rpm) and follow a ballistic
   100	trajectory aimed at a spot 6 degrees north of Jupiter's equator.  The probe
   101	will enter Jupiter's atmosphere at a shallow angle to avoid burning up like
   102	a meteor or ricocheting off the atmosphere back into space.
   103	
   104	     At approximately Mach 1 speed, the probe's pilot parachute will deploy,
   105	removing the deceleration module aft cover.  Deployment of the main
   106	parachute will follow, pulling the descent module out of the aeroshell to
   107	expose the instrument-sensing elements.  During the 75-minute descent
   108	into the Jovian atmosphere, the probe will use the orbiter to transmit
   109	data back to Earth.  After 75 minutes, the probe will be crushed under the
   110	heavy atmospheric pressure.
   111	
   112	     The Galileo orbiter will continue its primary mission, orbiting around
   113	Jupiter and four of its satellites, returning science data for the next 22
   114	months.
   115	
   116	     Galileo's scientific goals include the study of the chemical
   117	composition, state and dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere and satellites,
   118	and the investigation of the structure and physical dynamics of the
   119	powerful Jovian magnetosphere.
   120	
   121	     Overall responsibility for management of the project, including orbiter
   122	development, resides at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena,
   123	Calif.  The NASA Ames Research Center, Mountain View, Calif., manages
   124	the probe system.  JPL built the 2,500-lb. spacecraft and Hughes Aircraft
   125	Co. built the 740-lb. probe.
   126	
   127	     Modifications made to Galileo since flight postponement in 1986
   128	include the addition of sunshields to the base and top of the antenna, new
   129	thermal control surfaces, blankets and heaters.  Because of the extended
   130	length of the mission, the electrical circuitry of the thermoelectric
   131	generator has been revised to reduce power demand throughout the
   132	mission to assure adequate power supply for mission completion.
   133	
   134	     Joining Galileo in the payload bay of Atlantis will be the Shuttle Solar
   135	Backscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV) instrument.  The SSBUV is designed to
   136	provide calibration of backscatter ultraviolet instruments currently being
   137	flown on free-flying satellites.  SSBUV's primary objective is to check the
   138	calibration of the ozone sounders on satellites to verify the accuracy of
   139	the data set of atmospheric ozone and solar irradiance data.
   140	
   141	     The SSBUV is contained in two Get Away Special canisters in the
   142	payload bay and weighs about 1219 lbs .  One canister contains the SSBUV
   143	spectrometer and five supporting optical sensors.  The second canister
   144	houses data, command and power systems.  An interconnecting cable
   145	provides the communication link between the two canisters.
   146	
   147	
   148	
   149	     The Galileo probe arrived at the Spacecraft Assembly and
   150	Encapsulation Facility (SAEF) 2 on April 17 and the spacecraft arrived on
   151	May 16.  While at SAEF-2, the spacecraft and probe were joined and tested
   152	together to verify critical connections.  Galileo was delivered to the
   153	Vertical Processing Facility (VPF) on Aug. 1.  The Inertial Upper Stage
   154	(IUS) was delivered to the VPF on July 30.  The Galileo/IUS were joined
   155	together on Aug. 3 and all integrated testing was performed during the
   156	second week of August.
   157	
   158	
   159	
   160	GALILEO
   161	
   162	     Galileo is a NASA spacecraft mission to Jupiter to study the planet's
   163	atmosphere, satellites and surrounding magnetosphere.  It was named for
   164	the Italian renaissance scientist who discovered Jupiter's major moons by
   165	using the first astronomical telescope.
   166	
   167	     This mission will be the first to make direct measurements from an
   168	instrumented probe within Jupiter's atmosphere and the first to conduct
   169	long-term observations of the planet and its magnetosphere and satellites
   170	from orbit around Jupiter.  It will be the first orbiter and atmospheric
   171	probe for any of the outer planets.  On the way to Jupiter, Galileo also will
   172	observe Venus, the Earth-moon system, one or two asteroids and various
   173	phenomena in interplanetary space.
   174	
   175	     Galileo will be boosted into low-Earth orbit by the Shuttle Atlantis and
   176	then boosted out of Earth orbit by a solid rocket Inertial Upper Stage.  The
   177	spacecraft will fly past Venus and twice by the Earth, using gravity
   178	assists from the planets to pick up enough speed to reach Jupiter.  Travel
   179	time from launch to Jupiter is a little more than 6 years.
   180	
   181	     In December 1995, the Galileo atmospheric probe will conduct a brief,
   182	direct examination of Jupiter's atmosphere, while the larger part of the
   183	craft, the orbiter, begins a 22-month, 10-orbit tour of major satellites
   184	and the magnetosphere, including long-term observations of Jupiter
   185	throughout this phase.
   186	
   187	     The 2-ton Galileo orbiter spacecraft carries 9 scientific instruments. 
   188	There are another six experiments on the 750-pound probe.  The spacecraft
   189	radio link to Earth serves as an additional instrument for  scientific
   190	measurements.  The probe's scientific data will be relayed to Earth by the
   191	orbiter during the 75-minute period while the probe is descending into
   192	Jupiter's atmosphere.  Galileo will communicate with its controllers and
   193	scientists through NASAUs Deep Space Network, using tracking stations in
   194	California, Spain and Australia.

   218	EARTH TO JUPITER
   219	
   220	
   221	
   222	     Galileo will make three planetary encounters in the course of its
   223	gravity-assisted flight to Jupiter.  These provide opportunities for
   224	scientific observation and measurement of Venus and the Earth-moon
   225	system.  The mission also has a chance to fly close to one or two
   226	asteroids, bodies which have never been observed close up, and obtain data
   227	on other phenomena of interplanetary space.
   228	
   229	     Scientists are currently studying how to use the Galileo scientific
   230	instruments and the limited ability to collect, store and transmit data
   231	
   232	
   233	
   234	
   235	
   236	
   237	during the early phase of flight to make the best use of these
   238	opportunities.  Instruments designed to observe Jupiter's atmosphere from
   239	afar can improve our knowledge of the atmosphere of Venus and sensors
   240	designed for the study of Jupiter's moons can add to our information about
   241	our own moon.
   242	
   243	
   244	
   245	
   246	VENUS
   247	
   248	     The Galileo spacecraft will approach Venus early in 1990 from the
   249	night side and pass across the sunlit hemisphere, allowing observation of
   250	the clouds and atmosphere.  Both infrared and ultraviolet spectral
   251	observations are planned, as well as several camera images and other
   252	remote measurements.  The search for deep cloud patterns and for
   253	lightning storms will be limited by the fact that all the Venus data must
   254	be tape-recorded on the spacecraft for playback 8 months later.
   255	
   256	     The spacecraft was originally designed to operate between Earth and
   257	Jupiter, where sunlight is 25 times weaker than at Earth and
   258	temperatures are much lower.  The VEEGA mission will expose the
   259	spacecraft to a hotter environment from Earth to Venus and back. 
   260	Spacecraft engineers devised a set of sunshades to protect the craft.  For
   261	this system to work, the front end of the spacecraft must be aimed
   262	precisely at the Sun, with the main antenna furled for protection from the
   263	Sun's rays until after the first Earth flyby in December 1990.  This
   264	precludes the use of the Galileo high-gain antenna and therefore,
   265	scientists must wait until the spacecraft is close to Earth to receive the
   266	recorded Venus data, transmitted through a low-gain antenna.
   267	
   268	
   269	
   270	FIRST EARTH PASS
   271	
   272	     Approaching Earth for the first time about 14 months after launch, the
   273	Galileo spacecraft will observe, from a distance, the nightside of Earth
   274	and parts of both the sunlit and unlit sides of the moon.  After passing
   275	Earth, Galileo will observe Earth's sunlit side.  At this short range,
   276	scientific data are transmitted at the high rate using only the
   277	spacecraft's low-gain antennas.  The high-gain antenna is to be unfurled
   278	like an umbrella, and its high-power transmitter turned on and checked
   279	out, about 5 months after the first Earth encounter.
   280	
   281	
   282	
   283	FIRST ASTEROID
   284	
   285	     Nine months after the Earth passage and still in an elliptical solar
   286	orbit, Galileo will enter the asteroid belt, and two months later, will have
   287	its first asteroid encounter.  Gaspra is believed to be a fairly
   288	representative main-belt asteroid, about 10 miles across and probably
   289	similar in composition to stony meteorites.
   290	
   291	
   292	
   293	
   294	
   295	
   296	
   297	     The spacecraft will pass within about 600 miles at a relative speed of
   298	about 18,000 miles per hour.  It will collect several pictures of Gaspra
   299	and make spectral measurements to indicate its composition and physical
   300	properties.
   301	
   302	
   303	
   304	
   305	SECOND EARTH PASS
   306	
   307	     Thirteen months after the Gaspra encounter, the spacecraft will have
   308	completed its 2-year elliptical orbit around the Sun and will arrive back
   309	at Earth.  It will need a much larger ellipse (with a 6-year period) to reach
   310	as far as Jupiter.  The second flyby of Earth will pump the orbit up to that
   311	size, acting as a natural apogee kick motor for the Galileo spacecraft.
   312	
   313	     Passing about 185 miles above the surface, near the altitude at which
   314	it had been deployed from the Space Shuttle almost three years earlier,
   315	Galileo will use Earth's gravitation to change the spacecraft's flight
   316	direction and pick up about 8,000 miles per hour in speed.
   317	
   318	     Each gravity-assist flyby requires about three rocket-thrusting
   319	sessions, using Galileo's onboard retropropulsion module, to fine-tune the
   320	flight path.  The asteroid encounters require similar maneuvers to obtain
   321	the best observing conditions.
   322	
   323	     Passing the Earth for the last time, the spacecraft's scientific
   324	equipment will make thorough observations of the planet, both for
   325	comparison with Venus and Jupiter and to aid in Earth studies.  If all goes
   326	well, there is a good chance that Galileo will enable scientists to record
   327	the motion of the moon about the Earth while the Earth itself rotates.
   328	
   329	
   330	
   331	
   332	SECOND ASTEROID
   333	
   334	     Nine months after the final Earth flyby, Galileo may have a second
   335	asteroid-observing opportunity.  Ida is about 20 miles across.  Like
   336	Gaspra, Ida is believed to represent the majority of main-belt asteroids in
   337	composition, though there are believed to be differences between the two. 
   338	Relative velocity for this flyby will be nearly 28,000 miles per hour, with
   339	a planned closest approach of about 600 miles.
   340	
   341	
   342	
   343	APPROACHING JUPITER
   344	
   345	     Some 2 years after leaving Earth for the third time and 5 months
   346	before reaching Jupiter, Galileo's probe must separate from the orbiter. 
   347	The spacecraft turns to aim the probe precisely for its entry point in the
   348	Jupiter atmosphere, spins up to 10 revolutions per minute and releases
   349	the spin-stabilized probe.  Then the Galileo orbiter maneuvers again to
   350	aim for its own Jupiter encounter and resumes its scientific
   351	measurements of the interplanetary environment underway since the
   352	launch more than 5 years before.
   353	
   354	     While the probe is still approaching Jupiter, the orbiter will have its
   355	first two satellite encounters.  After passing within 20,000 miles of
   356	Europa, it will fly about 600 miles above Io's volcano-torn surface,
   357	twenty times closer than the closest flyby altitude of Voyager in 1979.
   358	
   359	
   360	
   361	
   362	AT JUPITER
   363	
   364	
   365	The Probe at Jupiter
   366	
   367	     The probe mission has four phases:  launch, cruise, coast and
   368	entry-descent.  During launch and cruise, the probe will be carried by the
   369	orbiter and serviced by a common umbilical.  The probe will be dormant
   370	during cruise except for annual checkouts of spacecraft systems and
   371	instruments.  During this period, the orbiter will provide the probe with
   372	electric power, commands, data transmission and some thermal control.
   373	
   374	     Six hours before entering the atmosphere, the probe will be shooting
   375	through space at about 40,000 mph.  At this time, its command unit
   376	signals "wake up" and instruments begin collecting data on lightning, radio
   377	emissions and energetic particles.
   378	
   379	     A few hours later, the probe will slam into Jupiter's atmosphere at
   380	115,000 mph, fast enough to jet from Los Angeles to New York in 90
   381	seconds.  Deceleration to about Mach 1 -- the speed of sound -- should
   382	take just a few minutes.  At maximum deceleration as the craft slows
   383	from 115,000 mph to 100 mph, it will be hurtling against a force 350
   384	times Earth's gravity.  The incandescent shock wave ahead of the probe
   385	will be as bright as the sun and reach searing temperatures of up to
   386	28,000 degrees Fahrenheit.  After the aerodynamic braking has slowed the
   387	probe, it will drop its heat shields and deploy its parachute.  This will
   388	allow the probe to float down about 125 miles through the clouds, passing
   389	from a pressure of 1/10th that on Earth's surface to about 25 Earth
   390	atmospheres.
   391	
   392	     About 4 minutes after probe entry into JupiterUs atmosphere, a pilot
   393	chute deploys and explosive nuts shoot off the top section of the probe's
   394	protective shell.  As the cover whips away, it pulls out and opens the main
   395	parachute attached to the inner capsule.  What remains of the probe's
   396	outer shell, with its massive heat shield, falls away as the parachute
   397	slows the instrument module.
   398	
   399	     From there on, suspended from the main parachute, the probe's capsule
   400	with its activated instruments floats downward toward the bright clouds
   401	below.
   402	
   403	     The probe will pass through the white cirrus clouds of ammonia
   404	crystals - the highest cloud deck.  Beneath this ammonia layer probably lie
   405	reddish-brown clouds of ammonium hydrosulfides.  Once past this layer,
   406	the probe is expected to reach thick water clouds.  This lowest cloud layer
   407	may act as a buffer between the uniformly mixed regions below and the
   408	turbulent swirl of gases above.
   409	
   410	     Jupiter's atmosphere is primarily hydrogen and helium.  For most of its
   411	descent through Jupiter's three main cloud layers, the probe will be
   412	immersed in gases at or below room temperature.  However, it may
   413	encounter hurricane winds up to 200 mph and lightning and heavy rain at
   414	the base of the water clouds believed to exist on the planet.  Eventually,
   415	the probe will sink below these clouds, where rising pressure and
   416	temperature will destroy it.  The probe's active life in Jupiter's
   417	atmosphere is expected to be about 75 minutes in length.  The probe
   418	batteries are not expected to last beyond this point, and the relaying
   419	orbiter will move out of reach.
   420	
   421	     To understand this huge gas planet, scientists must find out about its
   422	chemical components and the dynamics of its atmosphere.  So far,
   423	scientific data are limited to a two-dimensional view (pictures of the
   424	planet's cloud tops) of a three-dimensional process (Jupiter's weather). 
   425	But to explore such phenomena as the planet's incredible coloring, the
   426	Great Red Spot and the swirling shapes and high-speed motion of its
   427	topmost clouds, scientists must penetrate Jupiter's visible surface and
   428	investigate the atmosphere concealed in the deep-lying layers below.
   429	
   430	     A set of six scientific instruments on the probe will measure, among
   431	other things, the radiation field near Jupiter, the temperature, pressure,
   432	density and composition of the planet's atmosphere from its first faint
   433	outer traces to the hot, murky hydrogen atmosphere 100 miles below the
   434	cloud tops.  All of the information will be gathered during the probe's
   435	descent on an 8-foot parachute.  Probe data will be sent to the Galileo
   436	Orbiter 133,000 miles overhead then relayed across the half billion miles
   437	to Deep Space Network stations on Earth.
   438	
   439	     To return its science, the probe relay radio aboard the orbiter must
   440	automatically acquire the probe signal below within 50 seconds, with a
   441	success probability of 99.5 percent.  It must reacquire the signal
   442	immediately should it become lost.
   443	
   444	     To survive the heat and pressure of entry, the probe spacecraft is
   445	composed of two separate units:  an inner capsule containing the
   446	scientific instruments, encased in a virtually impenetrable outer shell. 
   447	The probe weighs 750 pounds.  The outer shell is almost all heat shield
   448	material.
   449	
   450	
   451	The Orbiter at Jupiter
   452	
   453	     After releasing the probe, the orbiter will use its main engine to go
   454	into orbit around Jupiter.  This orbit, the first of 10 planned, will have a
   455	period of about 8 months.  A close flyby of Ganymede in July 1996 will
   456	shorten the orbit, and each time the Galileo orbiter returns to the inner
   457	zone of satellites, it will make a gravity-assist close pass over one or
   458	another of the satellites, changing Galileo's orbit while making close
   459	observations.  These satellite encounters will be at altitudes as close as
   460	125 miles above their surfaces.  Throughout the 22-month orbital phase,
   461	Galileo will continue observing the planet and the satellites and continue
   462	gathering data on the magnetospheric environment. 
   463	
   464	
   465	
   466	SCIENTIFIC ACTIVITIES
   467	
   468	     Galileo's scientific experiments will be carried out by more than 100
   469	scientists from six nations.  Except for the radio science investigation,
   470	these are supported by dedicated instruments on the Galileo orbiter and
   471	probe.  NASA has appointed 15 interdisciplinary scientists whose studies
   472	include data from more than one Galileo instrument.
   473	
   474	     The instruments aboard the probe will measure the temperatures and
   475	pressure of Jupiter's atmosphere at varying altitudes and determine its
   476	chemical composition including major and minor constituents (such as
   477	hydrogen, helium, ammonia, methane, and water) and the ratio of hydrogen
   478	to helium.  Jupiter is thought to have a bulk composition similar to that of
   479	the primitive solar nebula from which it was formed.  Precise
   480	determination of the ratio of hydrogen to helium would provide an
   481	important factual check of the Big Bang theory of the genesis of the
   482	universe.
   483	
   484	     Other probe experiments will determine the location and structure of
   485	Jupiter's clouds, the existence and nature of its lightning, and the amount
   486	of heat radiating from the planet compared to the heat absorbed from
   487	sunlight.
   488	
   489	     In addition, measurements will be made of Jupiter's numerous radio
   490	emissions and of the high-energy particles trapped in the planet's
   491	innermost magnetic field.  These measurements for Galileo will be made
   492	within a distance of 26,000 miles from Jupiter's cloud tops, far closer
   493	than the previous closest approach to Jupiter by Pioneer 11.  The probe
   494	also will determine vertical wind shears using Doppler radio
   495	measurements made of probe motions from the radio receiver aboard the
   496	orbiter.
   497	
   498	     Jupiter appears to radiate about twice as much energy as it receives
   499	from the sun and the resulting convection currents from Jupiter's internal
   500	heat source towards its cooler polar regions could explain some of the
   501	planet's unusual weather patterns.
   502	
   503	     Jupiter is over 11 times the diameter of Earth and spins about two and
   504	one-half times faster -- a jovian day is only 10 hours long.  A point on the
   505	equator of Jupiter's visible surface races along at 28,000 mph.  This rapid
   506	spin may account for many of the bizarre circulation patterns observed on
   507	the planet.
   508	
   509	
   510	Spacecraft Scientific Activities
   511	
   512	     The Galileo mission and systems were designed to investigate three
   513	broad aspects of the Jupiter system: the planet's atmosphere, the
   514	satellites and the magnetosphere.  The spacecraft is in three segments to
   515	focus on these areas: the atmospheric probe; a non-spinning section of the
   516	orbiter carrying cameras and other remote sensors; and the spinning main
   517	section of the orbiter spacecraft which includes the propulsion module,
   518	the communications antennas, main computers and most support systems
   519	as well as the fields and particles instruments, which sense and measure
   520	the environment directly as the spacecraft flies through it.
   521	
   522	
   523	Probe Scientific Activities
   524	
   525	     The probe will enter the atmosphere about 6 degrees north of the
   526	equator.  The probe weighs just under 750 pounds and includes a
   527	deceleration module to slow and protect the descent module, which
   528	carries out the scientific mission.
   529	
   530	     The deceleration module consists of an aeroshell and an aft cover
   531	designed to block the heat generated by slowing from the probe's arrival
   532	speed of about 115,000 miles per hour to subsonic speed in less than 2
   533	minutes.  After the covers are released, the descent module deploys its
   534	8-foot  parachute and its instruments, the control and data system, and
   535	the radio-relay transmitter go to work.
   536	
   537	     Operating at 128 bits per second, the dual L-band transmitters send
   538	nearly identical streams of scientific data to the orbiter.  The probe's
   539	relay radio aboard the orbiter will have two redundant receivers that
   540	process probe science data, plus radio science and engineering data for
   541	transmission to the orbiter communications system.  Minimum received
   542	signal strength is 31 dBm.  The receivers also measure signal strength and
   543	Doppler shift as part of the experiments for measuring wind speeds and
   544	atmospheric absorption of radio signals.
   545	
   546	     Probe electronics are powered by long-life, high-discharge-rate
   547	34-volt lithium batteries, which remain dormant for more than 5 years
   548	during the journey to Jupiter.  The batteries have an estimated capacity of
   549	about 18 amp-hours on arrival at Jupiter.
   550	
   551	
   552	Orbiter Scientific Activities
   553	
   554	     The orbiter, in addition to delivering the probe to Jupiter and relaying
   555	probe data to Earth, will support all the scientific investigations of
   556	Venus, the Earth and moon, asteroids and the interplanetary medium,
   557	Jupiter's satellites and magnetosphere, and observation of the giant
   558	planet itself.
   559	
   560	     The orbiter weighs about 5,200 pounds including about 2,400 pounds of
   561	rocket propellant to be expended in some 30 relatively small maneuvers
   562	during the long gravity-assisted flight to Jupiter, the large thrust
   563	maneuver which puts the craft into its Jupiter orbit, and the 30 or so trim
   564	maneuvers planned for the satellite tour phase.
   565	
   566	     The retropropulsion module consists of 12 10-newton thrusters, a
   567	single 400-newton engine, and the fuel, oxidizer, and pressurizing-gas
   568	tanks, tubing, valves and control equipment.  (A thrust of 10 newtons
   569	would support a weight of about 2.2 pounds at Earth's surface).  The
   570	propulsion system was developed and built by
   571	Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm and provided by the Federal Republic of
   572	Germany.
   573	
   574	     The orbiter's maximum communications rate is 134 kilobits per second
   575	(the equivalent of about one black-and-white image per minute); there are
   576	other data rates, down to 10 bits per second, for transmitting engineering
   577	data under poor conditions.  The spacecraft transmitters operate at
   578	S-band and X-band (2295 and 8415 megahertz) frequencies between Earth
   579	and on L-band between the probe.
   580	
   581	     The high-gain antenna is a 16-foot umbrella-like reflector unfurled
   582	after the first Earth flyby.  Two low-gain antennas (one pointed forward
   583	and one aft, both mounted on the spinning section) are provided to support
   584	communications during the Earth-Venus-Earth leg of the flight and
   585	whenever the main antenna is not deployed and pointed at Earth.  The
   586	despun section of the orbiter carries a radio relay antenna for receiving
   587	the probe's data transmissions.
   588	
   589	     Electrical power is provided to Galileo's equipment by two radioisotope
   590	thermoelectric generators.  Heat produced by natural radioactive decay of
   591	plutonium 238 dioxide is converted to approximately 500 watts of
   592	electricity (570 watts at launch, 480 at the end of the mission) to operate
   593	the orbiter equipment for its 8-year active period.  This is the same type
   594	of power source used by the Voyager and Pioneer Jupiter spacecraft in
   595	their long outer-planet missions, by the Viking lander spacecraft on Mars
   596	and the lunar scientific packages left on the Moon.
   597	
   598	     Most spacecraft are stabilized in flight either by spinning around a
   599	major axis or by maintaining a fixed orientation in space, referenced to
   600	the sun and another star.  Galileo represents a hybrid of these techniques,
   601	with a spinning section rotating ordinarily at 3 rpm and a "despun" section
   602	which is counter-rotated to provide a fixed orientation for cameras and
   603	other remote sensors.
   604	
   605	     Instruments that measure fields and particles, together with the main
   606	antenna, the power supply, the propulsion module, most of the computers
   607	and control electronics, are mounted on the spinning section.  The
   608	instruments include magnetometer sensors mounted on a 36-foot boom to
   609	escape interference from the spacecraft; a plasma instrument detecting
   610	low-energy charged particles and a plasma-wave detector to study waves
   611	generated in planetary magnetospheres and by lightning discharges; a
   612	high-energy particle detector; and a detector of cosmic and Jovian dust.
   613	
   614	     The despun section carries instruments and other equipment whose
   615	operation depends on a fixed orientation in space.  The instruments include
   616	the camera system; the near-infrared mapping spectrometer to make
   617	multispectral images for atmosphere and surface chemical analysis; the
   618	ultraviolet spectrometer to study gases and ionized gases; and the
   619	photopolarimeter radiometer to measure radiant and reflected energy.  The
   620	camera system is expected to obtain images of Jupiter's satellites at
   621	resolutions from 20 to 1,000 times better than Voyager's best.
   622	
   623	     This section also carries a dish antenna to track the probe in Jupiter's
   624	atmosphere and pick up its signals for relay to Earth.  The probe is carried
   625	on the despun section, and before it is released, the whole spacecraft is
   626	spun up briefly to 10 rpm in order to spin-stabilize the probe.
   627	
   628	     The Galileo spacecraft will carry out its complex operations, including
   629	maneuvers, scientific observations and communications, in response to
   630	stored sequences which are interpreted and executed by various on-board
   631	computers.  These sequences are sent up to the orbiter periodically
   632	through the Deep Space Network in the form of command loads. 
   633	
   634	
   635	GROUND SYSTEMS
   636	
   637	     Galileo communicates with Earth via NASA's Deep Space Network
   638	(DSN), which has a complex of large antennas with receivers and
   639	transmitters located in the California desert, another in Australia and a
   640	third in Spain, linked to a network control center at NASAUs Jet Propulsion
   641	Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.  The spacecraft receives commands, sends
   642	science and engineering data, and is tracked by Doppler and ranging
   643	measurements through this network.
   644	
   645	     At JPL, about 275 scientists, engineers and technicians, will be
   646	supporting the mission at launch, increasing to nearly 400 for Jupiter
   647	operations including support from the German retropropulsion team at
   648	their control center in the FGR.  Their responsibilities include spacecraft
   649	command, interpreting engineering and scientific data from Galileo to
   650	understand its performance, and analyzing navigation data from the DSN. 
   651	The controllers use a set of complex computer programs to help them
   652	control the spacecraft and interpret the data.
   653	
   654	     Because the time delay in radio signals from Earth to Jupiter and back
   655	is more than an hour, the Galileo spacecraft was designed to operate from
   656	programs sent to it in advance and stored in spacecraft memory.  A single
   657	master sequence program can cover 4 weeks of quiet operations between
   658	planetary and satellite encounters.  During busy Jupiter operations, one
   659	program covers only a few days.  Actual spacecraft tasks are carried out
   660	by several subsystems and scientific instruments, many of which work
   661	from their own computers controlled by the main sequence.
   662	
   663	     Designing these sequences is a complex process balancing the desire to
   664	make certain scientific observations with the need to safeguard the
   665	spacecraft and mission.  The sequence design process itself is supported
   666	by software programs, for example, which display to the scientist maps of
   667	the instrument coverage on the surface of an approaching satellite for a
   668	given spacecraft orientation and trajectory.  Notwithstanding these aids,
   669	a typical 3-day satellite encounter may take efforts spread over many
   670	months to design, check and recheck.  The controllers also use software
   671	designed to check the command sequence further against flight rules and
   672	constraints.
   673	
   674	     The spacecraft regularly reports its status and health through an
   675	extensive set of engineering measurements.  Interpreting these data into
   676	trends and averting or working around equipment failures is a major task
   677	for the mission operations team.  Conclusions from this activity become
   678	an important input, along with scientific plans, to the sequence design
   679	process.  This too is supported by computer programs written and used in
   680	the mission support area.
   681	
   682	     Navigation is the process of estimating, from radio range and Doppler
   683	measurements, the position and velocity of the spacecraft to predict its
   684	flight path and design course-correcting maneuvers.  These calculations
   685	must be done with computer support.  The Galileo mission, with its
   686	complex gravity-assist flight to Jupiter and 10 gravity-assist satellite
   687	encounters in the Jovian system, is extremely dependent on consistently
   688	accurate navigation.
   689	
   690	     In addition to the programs that directly operate the spacecraft and
   691	are periodically transmitted to it, the mission operations team uses
   692	software amounting to 650,000 lines of programming code in the sequence
   693	design process; 1,615,000 lines in the telemetry interpretation; and
   694	550,000 lines of code in navigation.  These must all be written, checked,
   695	tested, used in mission simulations and, in many cases, revised before the
   696	mission can begin.
   697	
   698	Science investigators are located at JPL or other university laboratories
   699	and linked by computers.  From any of these locations, the scientists can
   700	be involved in developing the sequences affecting their experiments and,
   701	in some cases, in helping to change preplanned sequences to follow up on
   702	unexpected discoveries with second looks and confirming observations.
   703	
   704	
   705	
   706	
   707	JUPITER'S SYSTEM
   708	
   709	     Jupiter is the largest and fastest-spinning planet in the solar system. 
   710	Its radius is more than 11 times Earth's, and its mass is 318 times that of
   711	our planet.  Named for the chief of the Roman gods, Jupiter contains more
   712	mass than all the other planets combined.  It is made mostly of light
   713	elements, principally hydrogen and helium.  Its atmosphere and clouds are
   714	deep and dense, and a significant amount of energy is emitted from its
   715	interior.
   716	
   717	     The earliest Earth-based telescopic observations showed bands and
   718	spots in Jupiter's atmosphere.  One storm system, the Red Spot, has been
   719	seen to persist over three centuries.
   720	
   721	     Atmospheric forms and dynamics were observed in increasing detail
   722	with the Pioneer and Voyager flyby spacecraft, and Earth-based infrared
   723	astronomers have recently studied the nature and vertical dynamics of
   724	deeper clouds.
   725	
   726	     Sixteen satellites are known.  The four largest, discovered by the
   727	Italian scientist Galileo Galilei in 1610, are the size of small planets. 
   728	The innermost of these, Io, has active sulfurous volcanoes, discovered by
   729	Voyager 1 and further observed by Voyager 2 and Earth-based infrared
   730	astronomy.  Io and Europa are about the size and density of Earth's moon (3
   731	to 4 times the density of water) and probably rocky inside.  Ganymede and
   732	Callisto, further out from Jupiter, are the size of Mercury but less than
   733	twice as dense as water.  Their cratered surfaces look icy in Voyager
   734	images, and they may be composed partly of ice or water.
   735	
   736	     Of the other satellites, eight (probably captured asteroids) orbit
   737	irregularly far from the planet, and four (three discovered by the Voyager
   738	mission in 1979) are close to the planet.  Voyager also discovered a thin
   739	ring system at Jupiter in 1979.
   740	
   741	     Jupiter has the strongest planetary magnetic field known.  The
   742	resulting magnetosphere is a huge teardrop-shaped, plasma-filled cavity
   743	in the solar wind pointing away from the sun.  JupiterUs magnetosphere is
   744	the largest single entity in our solar system, measuring more than 14
   745	times the diameter of the sun.  The inner part of the magnetic field is
   746	doughnut- shaped, but farther out it flattens into a disk.  The magnetic
   747	poles are offset and tilted relative to Jupiter's axis of rotation, so the
   748	field appears to wobble with Jupiter's rotation (just under 10 hours),
   749	sweeping up and down across the inner satellites and making waves
   750	throughout the magnetosphere. 
   751	
   752	
   753	
   754	
   755	WHY JUPITER INVESTIGATIONS ARE IMPORTANT
   756	
   757	     With a thin skin of turbulent winds and brilliant, swift-moving clouds,
   758	the huge sphere of Jupiter is a vast sea of liquid hydrogen and helium. 
   759	Jupiter's composition (about 88 percent hydrogen and 11 percent helium
   760	with small amounts of methane, ammonia and water) is thought to
   761	resemble the makeup of the solar nebula, the cloud of gas and dust from
   762	which the sun and planets formed.  Scientists believe Jupiter holds
   763	important clues to conditions in the early solar system and the process of
   764	planet formation.
   765	
   766	     Jupiter may also provide insights into the formation of the universe
   767	itself.  Since it resembles the interstellar gas and dust  that are thought
   768	to have been created in the "Big Bang," studies of Jupiter may help
   769	scientists calibrate models of the beginning of the universe.
   770	
   771	     Though starlike in composition, Jupiter is too small to generate
   772	temperatures high enough to ignite nuclear fusion, the process that
   773	powers the stars.  Some scientists believe that the sun and Jupiter began
   774	as unequal partners in a binary star system.  (If a double star system had
   775	developed, it is unlikely life could have arisen in the solar system.)  While
   776	in a sense a "failed star," Jupiter is almost as large as a planet can be.  If
   777	it contained more mass, it would not have grown larger, but would have
   778	shrunk from compression by its own gravity.  If it were 100 times more
   779	massive, thermonuclear reactions would ignite, and Jupiter would be a
   780	star.
   781	
   782	     For a brief period after its formation, Jupiter was much hotter, more
   783	luminous, and about 10 times larger than it is now, scientists believe.
   784	Soon after accretion (the condensation of a gas and dust cloud into a
   785	planet), its brightness dropped from about one percent of the Sun's to
   786	about one billionth -- a decline of ten million times.
   787	
   788	     In its present state Jupiter emits about twice as much heat as it
   789	receives from the Sun.  The loss of this heat -- residual energy left over
   790	from the compressive heat of accretion -- means that Jupiter is cooling
   791	and losing energy at a tremendously rapid rate.  Temperatures in Jupiter's
   792	core, which were about 90,000 degrees Fahrenheit in the planet's hot,
   793	early phase, are now about 54,000 degrees Fahrenheit, 100 times hotter
   794	than any terrestrial surface, but 500 times cooler than the temperature at
   795	the center of the sun.  Temperatures on Jupiter now range from 54,000
   796	degrees Fahrenheit at the core to minus 248 degrees Fahrenheit at the top
   797	of the cloud banks.
   798	
   799	     Mainly uniform in composition, Jupiter's structure is determined by
   800	gradations in temperature and pressure.  Deep in Jupiter's interior there is
   801	thought to be a small rocky core, comprising about four percent of the
   802	planet's mass.  This "small" core (about the size of 10 Earths) is
   803	surrounded by a 25,000-mile-thick layer of liquid metallic hydrogen.
   804	(Metallic hydrogen is liquid, but sufficiently compressed to behave as
   805	metal.)  Motions of this liquid "metal" are the source of the planet's
   806	enormous magnetic field.  This field is created by the same dynamo effect
   807	found in the metallic cores of Earth and other planets.
   808	
   809	     At the outer limit of the metallic hydrogen layer, pressures equal three
   810	million times that of Earth's atmosphere and the temperature has cooled
   811	to 19,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
   812	
   813	     Surrounding the central metallic hydrogen region is an outer shell of
   814	"liquid" molecular hydrogen.  Huge pressures compress Jupiter's gaseous
   815	hydrogen until, at this level, it behaves like a liquid.  The liquid hydrogen
   816	layer extends upward for about 15,000 miles.  Then it gradually becomes
   817	gaseous.  This transition region between liquid and gas marks, in a sense,
   818	where the solid and liquid planet ends and its atmosphere begins.
   819	
   820	     From here, Jupiter's atmosphere extends up for 600 more miles, but
   821	only in the top 50 miles are found the brilliant bands of clouds for which
   822	Jupiter is known.  The tops of these bands are colored bright yellow, red
   823	and orange from traces of phosphorous and sulfur.  Five or six of these
   824	bands, counterflowing east and west, encircle the planet in each
   825	hemisphere.  At one point near Jupiter's equator, east winds of 220 mph
   826	blow right next to west winds of 110 mph.  At boundaries of these bands,
   827	rapid changes in wind speed and direction create large areas of turbulence
   828	and shear.  These are the same forces that create tornados here on Earth. 
   829	On Jupiter, these "baroclinic instabilities" are major phenomena, creating
   830	chaotic, swirling winds and spiral features such as White Ovals.
   831	
   832	     The brightest cloud banks, known as zones, are believed to be higher,
   833	cooler areas where gases are ascending.  The darker bands, called belts,
   834	
   835	
   836	
   837	
   838	
   839	
   840	are thought to be warmer, cloudier regions of descent.
   841	
   842	     The top cloud layer consists of white cirrus clouds of ammonia
   843	crystals, at a pressure six-tenths that of Earth's atmosphere at sea level
   844	(.6 bar).  Beneath this layer, at a pressure of about two Earth atmospheres
   845	(2 bars) and a temperature of near minus 160 degrees Fahrenheit, a
   846	reddish-brown cloud of ammonium hydrosulfide is predicted.
   847	
   848	     At a pressure of about 6 bars, there are believed to be clouds of water
   849	and ice.  However, recent Earth-based spectroscopic studies suggest that
   850	there may be less water on Jupiter than expected.  While scientists
   851	previously believed Jupiter and the sun would have similar proportions of
   852	water, recent work indicates there may be 100 times less water on
   853	Jupiter than if it had a solar mixture of elements.  If this is the case,
   854	there may be only a thin layer of water-ice at the 6 bar level.
   855	
   856	     However, Jupiter's cloud structure, except for the highest layer of
   857	ammonia crystals, remains uncertain.  The height of the lower clouds is
   858	still theoretical -- clouds are predicted to lie at the temperature levels
   859	where their assumed constituents are expected to condense.  The Galileo
   860	probe will make the first direct observations of Jupiter's lower
   861	atmosphere and clouds, providing crucial information.
   862	
   863	     The forces driving Jupiter's fast-moving winds are not well understood
   864	yet.  The classical explanation holds that strong currents are created by
   865	convection of heat from Jupiter's hot interior to the cooler polar regions,
   866	much as winds and ocean currents are driven on Earth, from equator to
   867	poles.  But temperature differences do not fully explain wind velocities
   868	that can reach 265 mph.  An alternative theory is that pressure
   869	differences, due to changes in the thermodynamic state of hydrogen at
   870	high and low temperatures, set up the wind jets.
   871	
   872	     Jupiter's rapid rotation rate is thought to have effects on wind
   873	velocity and to produce some of Jupiter's bizarre circulation patterns,
   874	including many spiral features.  These rotational effects are known as
   875	manifestations of the Coriolis force.  Coriolis force is what determines
   876	the spin direction of weather systems.  It basically means that on the
   877	surface of a sphere (a planet), a parcel of gas farther from the poles has a
   878	higher rotational velocity around the planet than a parcel closer to the
   879	poles.  As gases then move north or south, interacting parcels with
   880	different velocities produce vortices (whirlpools).  This may account for
   881	some of Jupiter's circular surface features.
   882	
   883	Jupiter spins faster than any planet in the solar system.  Though 11 times
   884	Earth's diameter, Jupiter spins more than twice as fast (once in 10 hours),
   885	giving gases on the surface extremely high rates of travel -- 22,000 mph
   886	at the equator, compared with 1000 mph for air at Earth's equator. 
   887	Jupiter's rapid spin also causes this gas and liquid planet to flatten
   888	markedly at the poles and bulge at the equator.
   889	
   890	     Visible at the top of Jupiter's atmosphere are eye-catching features
   891	such as the famous Great Red Spot and the exotic White Ovals, Brown
   892	Barges and White Plumes.  The Great Red Spot, which is 25,000 miles wide
   893	and large enough to swallow three Earths, is an enormous oval eddy of
   894	
   895	
   896	
   897	
   898	
   899	
   900	swirling gases.  It is driven by two counter-flowing jet streams, which
   901	pass, one on each side of it, moving in opposite directions, each with
   902	speeds of 100-200 mph.  The Great Red Spot was first discovered in 1664,
   903	by the British scientist Roger Hook, using Galileo's telescope.  In the three
   904	centuries since, the  huge vortex has remained constant in latitude in
   905	Jupiter's southern equatorial belt.  Because of its stable position,
   906	astronomers once thought it might be a volcano.
   907	
   908	     Another past theory compared the Great Red Spot to a gigantic
   909	hurricane.  However, the GRS rotates anti-cyclonically while hurricanes
   910	are cyclonic features (counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere,
   911	clockwise in the southern) -- and the dynamics of the Great Red Spot
   912	appear unrelated to moisture.
   913	
   914	  The Great Red Spot most closely resembles an enormous tornado, a huge
   915	vortex that sucks in smaller vortices.  The Coriolis effect  created by
   916	Jupiter's fast spin, appears to be the key to the dynamics that drive the
   917	spot.
   918	
   919	     The source of the Great Red Spot's color remains a mystery.  Many
   920	scientists now believe it to be caused by phosphorus, but its spectral line
   921	does not quite match that of phosphorus.  The GRS may be the largest in a
   922	whole array of spiral phenomena with similar dynamics.  About a dozen
   923	white ovals, circulation patterns resembling the GRS, exist in the
   924	southern latitudes of Jupiter and appear to be driven by the same forces. 
   925	Scientists do not know why these ovals are white.
   926	
   927	     Scientists believe the brown barges, which appear like dark patches on
   928	the planet, are holes in the upper clouds, through which the reddish-brown
   929	lower cloud layer may be glimpsed.  The equatorial plumes, or white
   930	plumes, may be a type of wispy cirrus anvil cloud.

   970	responsibility includes designing, building, testing, operating and tracking
   971	Galileo.  NASA's Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif. is responsible
   972	for the atmosphere probe, which was built by Hughes Aircraft Company, El
   973	Segundo, Calif.
   974	
   975	     The probe project and science teams will be stationed at Ames during
   976	pre-mission, mission operations, and data reduction periods.  Team
   977	members will be at Jet Propulsion Laboratory for probe entry.
   978	
   979	     The Federal Republic of Germany has furnished the orbiter's
   980	retropropulsion module and is participating in the scientific
   981	investigations.  The radioisotope thermoelectric generators were designed

  1103	STS-34 INERTIAL UPPER STAGE (IUS-19)
  1104	
  1105	     The Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) will again be used with the Space
  1106	Shuttle, this time to transport NASA's Galileo spacecraft out of Earth's
  1107	orbit to Jupiter, a 2.5-billion-mile journey.
  1108	
  1109	     The IUS has been used previously to place three Tracking and Data
  1110	Relay Satellites in geostationary orbit as well as to inject the Magellan
  1111	spacecraft into its interplanetary trajectory to Venus.  In addition, the
  1112	IUS has been selected by the agency for the Ulysses solar polar orbit
  1113	mission.
  1114	
  1115	     After 2 1/2 years of competition, Boeing Aerospace Co., Seattle, was
  1116	selected in August 1976 to begin preliminary design of the IUS.  The IUS
  1117	was developed and built under contract to the Air Force Systems
  1118	Command's Space Systems Division.  The Space Systems Division is
  1119	executive agent for all Department of Defense activities pertaining to the
  1120	Space Shuttle system.  NASA, through the Marshall Space Flight Center,
  1121	Huntsville, Ala., purchases the IUS through the Air Force and manages the
  1122	integration activities of the upper stage to NASA spacecraft. 
  1123	
  1124	
  1125	Specifications
  1126	
  1127	     IUS-19, to be used on mission STS-34, is a two-stage vehicle weighing
  1128	approximately 32,500 lbs.  Each stage has a solid rocket motor (SRM),
  1129	preferred over liquid-fueled engines because of SRM's relative simplicity,
  1130	high reliability, low cost and safety.
  1131	
  1132	     The IUS is 17 ft. long and 9.25 ft. in diameter.  It consists of an aft
  1133	skirt, an aft stage SRM generating approximately 42,000 lbs. of thrust, an
  1134	
  1135	
  1136	
  1137	
  1138	
  1139	
  1140	interstage, a forward-stage SRM generating approximately 18,000 lbs. of
  1141	thrust, and an equipment support section.
  1142	
  1143	
  1144	Airborne Support Equipment
  1145	
  1146	     The IUS Airborne Support Equipment (ASE) is the mechanical, avionics
  1147	and structural equipment located in the orbiter.  The ASE supports the IUS
  1148	and the Galileo in the orbiter payload bay and elevates the combination for
  1149	final checkout and deployment from the orbiter.
  1150	
  1151	     The IUS ASE consists of the structure, electromechanical mechanisms,
  1152	batteries, electronics and cabling to support the Galileo/IUS.  These ASE
  1153	subsystems enable the deployment of the combined vehicle; provide,
  1154	distribute and/or control electrical power to the IUS and spacecraft;
  1155	provide plumbing to cool the radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG)
  1156	aboard Galileo; and serve as communication paths between the IUS and/or
  1157	spacecraft and the orbiter.
  1158	
  1159	
  1160	IUS Structure
  1161	
  1162	     The IUS structure is capable of supporting loads generated internally
  1163	and also by the cantilevered spacecraft during orbiter operations and the
  1164	IUS free flight.  It is made of aluminum skin-stringer construction, with
  1165	longerons and ring frames.      
  1166	
  1167	
  1168	Equipment Support Section
  1169	
  1170	     The top of the equipment support section contains the spacecraft
  1171	interface mounting ring and electrical interface connector segment for
  1172	mating and integrating the spacecraft with the IUS.  Thermal isolation is
  1173	provided by a multilayer insulation blanket across the interface between
  1174	the IUS and Galileo.
  1175	
  1176	     The equipment support section also contains the avionics which
  1177	provide guidance, navigation, control, telemetry, command and data
  1178	management, reaction control and electrical power.  All mission-critical
  1179	components of the avionics system, along with thrust vector actuators,
  1180	reaction control thrusters, motor igniter and pyrotechnic stage separation
  1181	equipment are redundant to assure reliability of better than 98 percent.
  1182	
  1183	
  1184	IUS Avionics Subsystems
  1185	
  1186	     The avionics subsystems consist of the telemetry, tracking and
  1187	command subsystems; guidance and navigation subsystem; data
  1188	management; thrust vector control; and electrical power subsystems. 
  1189	These subsystems include all the electronic and electrical hardware used
  1190	to perform all computations, signal conditioning, data processing and
  1191	formatting associated with navigation, guidance, control, data and
  1192	redundancy management.  The IUS avionics subsystems also provide the
  1193	equipment for communications between the orbiter and ground stations as
  1194	
  1195	
  1196	
  1197	
  1198	
  1199	
  1200	well as electrical power distribution.
  1201	
  1202	     Attitude control in response to guidance commands is provided by
  1203	thrust vectoring during powered flight and by reaction control thrusters
  1204	while coasting.  Attitude is compared with guidance commands to
  1205	generate error signals.  During solid motor firing, these commands gimble
  1206	the IUS's movable nozzle to provide the desired pitch and yaw control.  The
  1207	IUS's roll axis thrusters maintain roll control.  While coasting, the error
  1208	signals are processed in the computer to generate thruster commands to
  1209	maintain the vehicle's altitude or to maneuver the vehicle.  
  1210	
  1211	     The IUS electrical power subsystem consists of avionics batteries, IUS
  1212	power distribution units, a power transfer unit, utility batteries, a
  1213	pyrotechnic switching unit, an IUS wiring harness and umbilical and
  1214	staging connectors.  The IUS avionics system provides 5-volt electrical
  1215	power to the Galileo/IUS interface connector for use by the spacecraft
  1216	telemetry system.
  1217	
  1218	
  1219	IUS Solid Rocket Motors
  1220	
  1221	     The IUS two-stage vehicle uses a large solid rocket motor and a small
  1222	solid rocket motor.  These motors employ movable nozzles for thrust
  1223	vector control.  The nozzles provide up to 4 degrees of steering on the
  1224	large motor and 7 degrees on the small motor.  The large motor is the
  1225	longest-thrusting duration SRM ever developed for space, with the
  1226	capability to thrust as long as 150 seconds.  Mission requirements and
  1227	constraints (such as weight) can be met by tailoring the amount of
  1228	propellant carried.  The IUS-19 first-stage motor will carry 21,488 lb. of
  1229	propellant; the second stage 6,067 lb.

  1233	
  1234	The reaction control system controls the Galileo/IUS spacecraft attitude
  1235	during coasting, roll control during SRM thrustings, velocity impulses for
  1236	accurate orbit injection and the final collision-avoidance maneuver after
  1237	separation from the Galileo spacecraft.  
  1238	
  1239	As a minimum, the IUS includes one reaction control fuel tank with a
  1240	capacity of 120 lb. of hydrazine.  Production options are available to add a
  1241	second or third tank.  However, IUS-19 will require only one tank.
  1242	
  1243	
  1244	IUS To Spacecraft Interfaces
  1245	
  1246	Galileo is physically attached to the IUS at eight attachment points,
  1247	providing substantial load-carrying capability while minimizing the
  1248	transfer of heat across the connecting points.   Power, command and data
  1249	transmission between the two are provided by several IUS interface
  1250	connectors.   In addition, the IUS provides a multilayer insulation blanket
  1251	of aluminized Kapton with polyester net spacers across the Galileo/IUS
  1252	interface, along with an aluminized Beta cloth outer layer.  All IUS
  1253	thermal blankets are vented toward and into the IUS cavity, which in turn
  1254	
  1255	
  1256	
  1257	
  1258	
  1259	
  1260	is vented to the orbiter payload bay.  There is no gas flow between the
  1261	spacecraft and the IUS.  The thermal blankets are grounded to the IUS
  1262	structure to prevent electrostatic charge buildup.
  1263	
  1264	
  1265	Flight Sequence
  1266	
  1267	After the orbiter payload bay doors are opened in orbit, the orbiter will
  1268	maintain a preselected attitude to keep the payload within thermal
  1269	requirements and constraints.
  1270	
  1271	On-orbit predeployment checkout begins, followed by an IUS command link
  1272	check and spacecraft communications command check.  Orbiter trim
  1273	maneuvers are normally performed at this time.  
  1274	
  1275	     Forward payload restraints will be released and the aft frame of the
  1276	airborne-support equipment will tilt the Galileo/IUS to 29 degrees.  This
  1277	will extend the payload into space just outside the orbiter payload bay,
  1278	allowing direct communication with Earth during systems checkout.  The
  1279	orbiter then will be maneuvered to the deployment attitude.  If a problem
  1280	has developed within the spacecraft or IUS, the IUS and its payload can be
  1281	restowed.
  1282	
  1283	     Prior to deployment, the spacecraft electrical power source will be
  1284	switched from orbiter power to IUS internal power by the orbiter flight
  1285	crew.  After verifying that the spacecraft is on IUS internal power and
  1286	that all Galileo/IUS predeployment operations have been successfully
  1287	completed, a GO/NO-GO decision for deployment will be sent to the crew
  1288	from ground support.
  1289	
  1290	     When the orbiter flight crew is given a "Go" decision, they will
  1291	activate the ordnance that separates the spacecraft's umbilical cables. 
  1292	The crew then will command the electromechanical tilt actuator to raise
  1293	the tilt table to a 58-degree deployment position.  The orbiter's RCS
  1294	thrusters will be inhibited and an ordnance-separation device initiated to
  1295	physically separate the IUS/spacecraft combination from the tilt table.
  1296	
  1297	     Six hours, 20 minutes into the mission, compressed springs provide the
  1298	force to jettison the IUS/Galileo from the orbiter payload bay at
  1299	approximately 6 inches per second.  The deployment is normally performed
  1300	in the shadow of the orbiter or in Earth eclipse.  
  1301	
  1302	     The tilt table then will be lowered to minus 6 degrees after IUS and its
  1303	spacecraft are deployed.  A small orbiter maneuver is made to back away
  1304	from IUS/Galileo.  Approximately 15 minutes after deployment, the
  1305	orbiter's OMS engines will be ignited to move the orbiter away from its
  1306	released payload.
  1307	
  1308	     After deployment, the IUS/Galileo is controlled by the IUS onboard
  1309	computers.  Approximately 10 minutes after IUS/Galileo deployment from
  1310	the orbiter, the IUS onboard computer will send out signals used by the
  1311	IUS and/or Galileo to begin mission sequence events.  This signal will also
  1312	enable the IUS reaction control system.  All subsequent operations will be
  1313	sequenced by the IUS computer, from transfer orbit injection through
  1314	
  1315	
  1316	
  1317	
  1318	
  1319	
  1320	spacecraft separation and IUS deactivation. 
  1321	
  1322	     After the RCS has been activated, the IUS will maneuver to the
  1323	required thermal attitude and perform any required spacecraft thermal
  1324	control maneuvers.
  1325	
  1326	     At approximately 45 minutes after deployment from the orbiter, the
  1327	ordnance inhibits for the first SRM will be removed.  The belly of the
  1328	orbiter already will have been oriented towards the IUS/Galileo to protect
  1329	orbiter windows from the IUS's plume.  The IUS will recompute the first
  1330	ignition time and maneuvers necessary to attain the proper attitude for
  1331	the first thrusting period.  When the proper transfer orbit opportunity is
  1332	reached, the IUS computer will send the signal to ignite the first stage
  1333	motor 60 minutes after deployment.  After firing approximately 150
  1334	seconds, the IUS first stage will have expended its propellant and will be
  1335	separated from the IUS second stage.
  1336	
  1337	     Approximately 140 seconds after first-stage burnout, the second-
  1338	stage motor will be ignited, thrusting about 108 seconds.   The IUS second
  1339	stage then will separate and perform a final collision/contamination
  1340	avoidance maneuver before deactivating.
  1341	
  1342

  1344	
  1345	SHUTTLE SOLAR BACKSCATTER ULTRAVIOLET INSTRUMENT
  1346	
  1347	     The Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV) instrument was
  1348	developed by NASA to calibrate similar ozone measuring space-based
  1349	instruments on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
  1350	TIROS satellites (NOAA-9 and -11).
  1351	
  1352	     The SSBUV will help scientists solve the problem of data reliability
  1353	caused by calibration drift of solar backscatter ultraviolet (SBUV)
  1354	instruments on orbiting spacecraft.  The SSBUV uses the Space Shuttle's
  1355	orbital flight path to assess instrument performance by directly
  1356	comparing data from identical instruments aboard the TIROS spacecraft,
  1357	as the Shuttle and the satellite pass over the same Earth location within a
  1358	1-hour window.  These orbital coincidences can occur 17 times per day.
  1359	
  1360	     The SBUV measures the amount and height distribution of ozone in the
  1361	upper atmosphere.  It does this by measuring incident solar ultraviolet
  1362	radiation and ultraviolet radiation backscattered from the Earth's
  1363	atmosphere.  The SBUV measures these parameters in 12 discrete
  1364	wavelength channels in the ultraviolet.  Because ozone absorbs in the
  1365	ultraviolet, an ozone measurement can be derived from the ratio of
  1366	backscatter radiation at different wavelengths, providing an index of the
  1367	vertical distribution of ozone in the atmosphere.
  1368	
  1369	     Global concern over the depletion of the ozone layer has sparked
  1370	increased emphasis on developing and improving ozone measurement
  1371	methods and instruments.  Accurate, reliable measurements from space
  1372	are critical to the detection of ozone trends and for assessing the
  1373	potential effects and development of corrective measures.
  1374	
  1375	
  1376	
  1377	
  1378	
  1379	
  1380	
  1381	     The SSBUV missions are so important to the support of Earth science
  1382	that six additional missions have been added to the Shuttle manifest for
  1383	calibrating ozone instruments on future TIROS satellites.  In addition, the
  1384	dates of the four previously manifested SSBUV flights have been
  1385	accelerated.
  1386	
  1387	     The SSBUV instrument and its dedicated electronics, power, data and
  1388	command systems are mounted in the Shuttle's payload bay in two Get
  1389	Away  Special canisters, an instrument canister and a support canister. 
  1390	Together, they weigh approximately 1200 lb.   The instrument canister
  1391	holds the SSBUV, its specially designed aspect sensors and in-flight
  1392	calibration system.  A motorized door assembly opens the canister to
  1393	allow the SSBUV to view the sun and Earth and closes during the in-flight
  1394	calibration sequence.
  1395	
  1396	     The support canister contains the power system, data storage and
  1397	command decoders.  The dedicated power system can operate the SSBUV
  1398	for a total of approximately 40 hours.
  1399	
  1400	     The SSBUV is managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center,
  1401	Greenbelt, Md.  Ernest Hilsenrath is the principal investigator.

  1407	GROWTH HORMONE CONCENTRATIONS AND DISTRIBUTION IN PLANTS
  1408	
  1409	     The Growth Hormone Concentration and Distribution in Plants (GHCD)
  1410	experiment is designed to determine the effects of microgravity on the
  1411	concentration, turnover properties, and behavior of the plant growth
  1412	hormone, Auxin, in corn shoot tissue (Zea Mays).
  1413	
  1414	     Mounted in foam blocks inside two standard middeck lockers, the
  1415	equipment consists of four plant cannisters, two gaseous nitrogen
  1416	freezers and two temperature recorders.  Equipment for the experiment,
  1417	excluding the lockers, weighs 97.5 pounds.
  1418	
  1419	     A total of 228 specimens (Zea Mays seeds) are "planted" in special
  1420	filter, paper-Teflon tube holders no more than 56 hours prior to flight. 
  1421	The seeds remain in total darkness throughout the mission.
  1422	
  1423	     The GHCD experiment equipment and specimens will be prepared in a
  1424	Payload Processing Facility at KSC and placed in the middeck lockers.  The
  1425	GHCD lockers will be installed in the orbiter middeck within the last 14
  1426	hours before launch.
  1427	
  1428	     No sooner than 72 hours after launch, mission specialist Ellen Baker
  1429	will place two of the plant cannisters into the gaseous nitrogen freezers
  1430	to arrest the plant growth and preserve the specimens.  The payload will
  1431	be restowed in the lockers for the remainder of the mission.
  1432	
  1433	     After landing, the payload must be removed from the orbiter within 2

  1435	
  1436	
  1437	
  1438	
  1439	
  1440	hours and will be returned to customer representatives at the landing site. 
  1441	The specimens will be examined post flight for microgravity effects.
  1442	
  1443	      The GHCD experiment is sponsored by NASA Headquarters, the Johnson
  1444	Space Center and Michigan State University.

  1449	POLYMER MORPHOLOGY
  1450	
  1451	     The Polymer Morphology (PM) experiment is a 3M-developed organic
  1452	materials processing experiment designed to explore the effects of
  1453	microgravity on polymeric materials as they are processed in space. 
  1454	
  1455	     Since melt processing is one of the more industrially significant
  1456	methods for making products from polymers, it has been chosen for study
  1457	in the PM experiment.  Key aspects of melt processing include
  1458	polymerization, crystallization and phase separation.  Each aspect will be
  1459	examined in the experiment.  The polymeric systems for the first flight of
  1460	PM include polyethelyne, nylon-6 and polymer blends.
  1461	
  1462	     The apparatus for the experiment includes a Fournier transform
  1463	infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, an automatic sample manipulating system
  1464	and a process control and data acquisition computer known as the Generic
  1465	Electronics Module (GEM).  The experiment is contained in two separate,
  1466	hermetically sealed containers that are mounted in the middeck of the
  1467	orbiter.  Each container includes an integral heat exchanger that transfers
  1468	heat from the interior of the containers to the orbiter's environment.  All
  1469	sample materials are kept in triple containers for the safety of the
  1470	astronauts.
  1471	
  1472	     The PM experiment weighs approximately 200 lb., occupies three
  1473	standard middeck locker spaces (6 cubic ft., total) in the orbiter and
  1474	requires 240 watts to operate.
  1475	
  1476	     Mission specialists Franklin R. Chang-Diaz and Shannon W. Lucid are
  1477	responsible for the operation of the PM experiment on orbit.  Their
  1478	interface with the PM experiment is through a small, NASA-supplied
  1479	laptop computer that is used as an input and output device for the main PM
  1480	computer.  This interface has been programmed by 3M engineers to manage
  1481	and display the large quantity of data that is available to the crew.  The
  1482	astronauts will have an active role in the operation of the experiment.
  1483	
  1484	     In the PM experiment, infrared spectra (400 to 5000 cm-1) will be
  1485	acquired from the FTIR by the GEM computer once every 3.2 seconds as the
  1486	materials are processed on orbit.  During the 100 hours of processing
  1487	time, approximately 2 gigabytes of data will be collected.  Post flight, 3M
  1488	scientists will process the data to reveal the effects of microgravity on
  1489	the samples processed in space.
  1490	
  1491	     The PM experiment is unique among material processing experiments in
  1492	that measurements characterizing the effects of microgravity will be
  1493	made in real time, as the materials are processed in space.  
  1494	
  1495	
  1496	
  1497	
  1498	
  1499	
  1500	
  1501	     In most materials processing space experiments, the materials have
  1502	been processed in space with little or no measurements made during
  1503	on-orbit processing and the effects of microgravity determined post
  1504	facto.
  1505	
  1506	     The samples of polymeric materials being studied in the PM experiment
  1507	are thin films (25 microns or less) approximately 25 mm in diameter.  The
  1508	samples are mounted between two infrared transparent windows in a
  1509	specially designed infrared cell that provides the capability of  thermally
  1510	processing the samples to 200 degrees Celsius with a high degree of
  1511	thermal control.  The samples are mounted on a carousel that allows them
  1512	to be positioned, one at a time, in the infrared beam where spectra may be
  1513	acquired.  The GEM provides all carousel and sample cell control.  The first
  1514	flight of PM will contain 17 samples.
  1515	
  1516	     The PM experiment is being conducted by 3M's Space Research and
  1517	Applications Laboratory.  Dr. Earl L. Cook is 3M's Payload Representative
  1518	and Mission Coordinator.  Dr. Debra L. Wilfong is  PM's Science Coordinator,
  1519	and James E. Steffen is the Hardware Coordinator.
  1520	
  1521	     The PM experiment, a commercial development payload, is sponsored by
  1522	NASA's Office of Commercial Programs.  The PM experiment will be 3M's
  1523	fifth space experiment and the first under the company's 10-year Joint
  1524	Endeavor Agreement with NASA for 62 flight experiment opportunities. 
  1525	Previous 3M space experiments have studied organic crystal growth from
  1526	solution (DMOS/1 on mission STS 51-A and DMOS/2 on STS 61-B) and
  1527	organic thin film growth by physical vapor treatment (PVTOS/1 on STS
  1528	51-I and PVTOS/2 on mission STS-26).

  1533	STUDENT EXPERIMENT
  1534	
  1535	Zero Gravity Growth of Ice Crystals From Supercooled Water With Relation
  1536	To Temperature (SE82-15)
  1537	
  1538	     This experiment, proposed by Tracy L. Peters, formerly of Ygnacio High
  1539	School, Concord, Calif., will observe the geometric ice crystal shapes
  1540	formed at supercooled temperatures, below 0 degrees Celsius, without the
  1541	influence of gravity.  
  1542	
  1543	     Liquid water has been discovered at temperatures far below water's
  1544	freezing point.  This phonomenon occurs because liquid water does not
  1545	have a nucleus, or core, around which to form the crystal.  When the ice
  1546	freezes at supercold temperatures, the ice takes on many geometric
  1547	shapes based on the hexagon.  The shape of the crystal primarily depends
  1548	on the supercooled temperature and saturation of water vapor.  The shapes
  1549	of crystals vary from simple plates to complex prismatic crystals.
  1550	
  1551	     Many scientists have tried to determine the relation between
  1552	temperature and geometry, but gravity has deformed crystals, caused
  1553	convection currents in temperature-controlled apparatus, and caused
  1554	
  1555	
  1556	
  1557	
  1558	
  1559	
  1560	faults in the crystalline structure.  These all affect crystal growth by
  1561	either rapid fluctuations of temperature or gravitational influence of the
  1562	crystal geometry.  
  1563	
  1564	The results of this experiment could aid in the design of radiator cooling
  1565	and cryogenic systems and in the understanding of high-altitude
  1566	meteorology and planetary ring structure theories.
  1567	
  1568	Peters is now studying physics at the University of California at Berkeley. 
  1569	His teacher advisor is James R. Cobb, Ygnacio High School; his sponsor is
  1570	Boeing Aerospace Corp., Seattle.
  1571	
  1572	Peters also was honored as the first four-time NASA award winner at the
  1573	International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF), which recognizes
  1574	student's creative scientific endeavors in aerospace research.  At the
  1575	1982 ISEF, Peters was one of two recipients of the Glen T. Seaborg Nobel
  1576	Prize Visit Award, an all-expense-paid visit to Stockholm to attend the
  1577	Nobel Prize ceremonies, for his project "Penetration and Diffusion of
  1578	Supersonic Fluid."

  1583	MESOSCALE LIGHTNING EXPERIMENT
  1584	
  1585	     The Space Shuttle will again carry the Mesoscale Lightning Experiment
  1586	(MLE), designed to obtain nighttime images of lightning in order to better
  1587	understand the global distribution of lightning, the interrelationships
  1588	between lightning events in nearby storms, and relationships between
  1589	lightning, convective storms and precipitation.  
  1590	
  1591	     A better understanding of the relationships between lightning and
  1592	thunderstorm characteristics can lead to the development of applications
  1593	in severe storm warning and forecasting, and early warning systems for
  1594	lightning threats to life and property.
  1595	
  1596	     In recent years, NASA has used both Space Shuttle missions and
  1597	high-altitude U-2 aircraft to observe lightning from above convective
  1598	storms.  The objectives of these observations have been to determine
  1599	some of the baseline design requirements for a satellite-borne optical
  1600	lightning mapper sensor; study the overall optical and electrical
  1601	characteristics of lightning as viewed from above the cloudtop; and
  1602	investigate the relationship between storm electrical development and
  1603	the structure, dynamics and evolution of thunderstorms and thunderstorm
  1604	systems.
  1605	
  1606	     The MLE began as an experiment to demonstrate that meaningful,
  1607	qualitative observations of lightning could be made from the Shuttle. 
  1608	Having accomplished this, the experiment is now focusing on quantitative
  1609	measurements of lightning characteristics and observation simulations
  1610	for future space-based lightning sensors.
  1611	
  1612	     Data from the MLE will provide information for the development of
  1613	observation simulations for an upcoming polar platform and Space Station

  1620	instrument, the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS).  The lightning experiment
  1621	also will be helpful for designing procedures for using the Lightning
  1622	Mapper Sensor (LMS), planned for several geostationary platforms.
  1623	
  1624	      In this experiment, Atlantis'  payload bay camera will be pointed
  1625	directly below the orbiter to observe nighttime lightning in large, or
  1626	mesoscale, storm systems to gather global estimates of lightning as
  1627	observed from Shuttle altitudes.  Scientists on the ground will analyze the
  1628	imagery for the frequency of lightning flashes in active storm clouds
  1629	within the camera's field of view, the length of lightning discharges, and
  1630	cloud brightness when illuminated by the lightning discharge within the
  1631	cloud. 
  1632	
  1633	     If time permits during missions, astronauts also will use a handheld
  1634	35mm camera to photograph lightning activity in storm systems not
  1635	directly below the Shuttle's orbital track.
  1636	
  1637	     Data from the MLE will be associated with ongoing observations of
  1638	lightning made at several locations on the ground, including observations
  1639	made at facilities at the Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.;
  1640	Kennedy Space Center, Fla.; and the NOAA Severe Storms Laboratory,
  1641	Norman, Okla.  Other ground-based lightning detection systems in
  1642	Australia, South America and Africa will be intergrated when possible.
  1643	
  1644	The MLE is managed by the Marshall Space Flight Center.  Otha H. Vaughan
  1645	Jr., is coordinating the experiment.  Dr. Hugh Christian is the project
  1646	scientist, and Dr. James Arnold is the project manager.

  1653	     The IMAX project is a collaboration between NASA and the Smithsonian
  1654	Institution's National Air and Space Museum to document significant space
  1655	activities using the IMAX film medium.  This system, developed by the
  1656	IMAX Systems Corp., Toronto, Canada, uses specially designed 70mm film
  1657	cameras and projectors to record and display very high definition

  1660	     IMAX cameras previously have flown on Space Shuttle missions 41-C,
  1661	41-D and 41-G to document crew operations in the payload bay and the
  1662	orbiter's middeck and flight deck along with spectacular views of space
  1663	and Earth.  
  1664	
  1665	     Film from those missions form the basis for the IMAX production, "The
  1666	Dream is Alive."  On STS 61-B, an IMAX camera mounted in the payload bay
  1667	recorded extravehicular activities in the EAS/ACCESS space construction
  1668	demonstrations.
  1669	
  1670	     The IMAX camera, most recently carried aboard STS-29, will be used on
  1671	this mission to cover the deployment of the Galileo spacecraft and to
  1672	gather material on the use of observations of the Earth from space for
  1673	future IMAX films.

  1684	AIR FORCE MAUI OPTICAL SITE CALIBRATION TEST
  1685	
  1686	     The Air Force Maui Optical Site (AMOS) tests allow ground-based
  1687	electro-optical sensors located on Mt. Haleakala, Maui, Hawaii, to collect
  1688	imagery and signature data of the orbiter during cooperative overflights.
  1689	Scientific observations made of the orbiter while performing Reaction
  1690	Control System thruster firings, water dumps or payload bay light
  1691	activation are used to support the calibration of the AMOS sensors and the
  1692	validation of spacecraft contamination models.  AMOS tests have no
  1693	payload-unique flight hardware and only require that the orbiter be in
  1694	predefined attitude operations and lighting conditions.
  1695	
  1696	     The AMOS facility was developed by Air Force Systems Command
  1697	(AFSC) through its Rome Air Development Center, Griffiss Air Force Base,
  1698	N.Y., and is administered and operated by the AVCO Everett Research
  1699	Laboratory, Maui.  The principal investigator for the AMOS tests on the
  1700	Space Shuttle is from AFSC's Air Force Geophysics Laboratory, Hanscom
  1701	Air Force Base, Mass.  A co-principal investigator is from AVCO.
  1702	
  1703	     Flight planning and mission support activities for the AMOS test
  1704	opportunities are provided by a detachment of AFSC's Space Systems
  1705	Division at Johnson Space Center, Houston.  Flight operations are
  1706	conducted at JSC Mission Control Center in coordination with the AMOS
  1707	facilities located in Hawaii.

  1712	SENSOR TECHNOLOGY EXPERIMENT
  1713	
  1714	     The Sensor Technology Experiment (STEX) is a radiation detection
  1715	experiment designed to measure the natural radiation background.  The
  1716	STEX is a self-contained experiment with its own power, sensor, computer
  1717	control and data storage.  A calibration pack, composed of a small number
  1718	of passive threshold reaction monitors, is attached to the outside of the
  1719	STEX package.
  1720	
  1721	     Sponsored by the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, the STEX
  1722	package weighs approximately 50 pounds and is stowed in a standard
  1723	middeck locker throughout the flight.

  1780	SPACEFLIGHT TRACKING AND DATA NETWORK
  1781	
  1782	     Primary communications for most activities on STS-34 will be
  1783	conducted through the orbiting Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System
  1784	(TDRSS), a constellation of three communications satellites in
  1785	geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the Earth.  In addition, three
  1786	NASA Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network (STDN) ground stations and
  1787	the NASA Communications Network (NASCOM), both managed by Goddard
  1788	Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., will play key roles in the mission.
  1789	
  1790	     Three stations -- Merritt Island and Ponce de Leon, Florida and the
  1791	Bermuda -- serve as the primary communications during the launch and
  1792	ascent phases of the mission.  For the first 80 seconds, all voice,
  1793	telemetry and other communications from the Space Shuttle are relayed to
  1794	
  1795	
  1796	
  1797	
  1798	
  1799	
  1800	the mission managers at Kennedy and Johnson Space Centers by way of the
  1801	Merritt Island facility.
  1802	
  1803	     At 80 seconds, the communications are picked up from the Shuttle and
  1804	relayed to the two NASA centers from the Ponce de Leon facility, 30 miles
  1805	north of the launch pad.  This facility provides the communications
  1806	between the Shuttle and the centers for 70 seconds, or until 150 seconds
  1807	into the mission.  This is during a critical period when exhaust from the
  1808	solid rocket motors "blocks out" the Merritt Island antennas.
  1809	
  1810	     The Merritt Island facility resumes communications to and from the
  1811	Shuttle after those 70 seconds and maintains them until 6 minutes, 30
  1812	seconds after launch when communications are "switched over" to
  1813	Bermuda.  Bermuda then provides the communications until 11 minutes
  1814	after liftoff when the TDRS-East satellite acquires the Shuttle. 
  1815	TDRS-West acquires the orbiter at launch plus 50 minutes.
  1816	
  1817	     The TDRS-East and -West satellites will provide communications with
  1818	the Shuttle during 85 percent or better of each orbit.  The TDRS-West
  1819	satellite will handle communications with the Shuttle during its descent
  1820	and landing phases.

  1837	
  1838	     Donald E. Williams, 47, Capt., USN, will serve as commander.  Selected
  1839	as an astronaut in January 1978, he was born in Lafayette, Ind.
  1840	
  1841	     Williams was pilot for STS-51D, the fourth flight of Discovery,
  1842	launched April 12, 1985.  During the mission, the seven-member crew
  1843	deployed the Anik-C communications satellite for Telesat of Canada and
  1844	the  Syncom IV-3 satellite for the U.S. Navy.  A malfunction in the Syncom
  1845	spacecraft resulted in the first unscheduled extravehicular, rendezvous
  1846	and proximity operation for the Space Shuttle in an attempt to activate
  1847	the satellite.
  1848	
  1849	     He graduated from Otterbein High School, Otterbein, Ind., in 1960 and
  1850	received his B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Purdue University
  1851	in 1964.  Williams completed his flight training at Pensacola, Fla.,
  1852	Meridian, Miss., and Kingsville, Texas, and earned his wings in 1966.

  1863	
  1864	
  1865	
  1866	     Michael J. McCulley, 46, Cdr., USN, will be pilot on this flight. Born in
  1867	San Diego, McCulley considers Livingston, Tenn., his hometown.  He was
  1868	selected as a NASA astronaut in 1984.  He is making his first Space
  1869	Shuttle flight.
  1870	
  1871	     McCulley graduated from Livingston Academy in 1961.  He received B.S.
  1872	and M.S. degrees in metallurgical engineering from Purdue University in
  1873	1970.
  1874	
  1875	     After graduating from high school, McCulley enlisted in the U.S. Navy
  1876	and subsequently served on one diesel-powered and two nuclear-powered
  1877	submarines.  Following flight training, he served tours of duty in A-4 and
  1878	A-65 aircraft and was selected to attend the Empire Test Pilots School in
  1879	Great Britain.  He served in a variety of test pilot billets at the Naval Air
  1880	Test Center, Patuxent River, Md., before returning to sea duty on the USS
  1881	Saratoga and USS Nimitz.
  1882	
  1883	     He has flown more than 50 types of aircraft, logging more than 4,760
  1884	hours, and has almost 400 carrier landings on six aircraft carriers.
  1885	
  1886	
  1887	
  1888	     Shannon W. Lucid, 46, will serve as mission specialist (MS-1) on this,
  1889	her second Shuttle flight.  Born in Shanghai, China, she considers Bethany,
  1890	Okla., her hometown.  Lucid is a member of the astronaut class of 1978.
  1891	
  1892	     Lucid's first Shuttle mission was during STS 51-G, launched from the
  1893	Kennedy Space Center on June 17, 1985.  During that flight, the crew
  1894	deployed communications satellites for Mexico, the Arab League and the
  1895	United States.
  1896	
  1897	     Lucid graduated from Bethany High School in 1960.  She then attended
  1898	the University of Oklahoma where she received a B.S. degree in chemistry
  1899	in 1963, an M.S. degree in biochemistry in 1970 and a Ph.D. in biochemistry
  1900	in 1973.
  1901	
  1902	     Before joining NASA, Lucid held a variety of academic assignments
  1903	such as teaching assistant at the University of Oklahoma's department of
  1904	chemistry; senior laboratory technician at the Oklahoma Medical Research
  1905	Foundation; chemist at Kerr-McGee in Oklahoma City; graduate assistant in
  1906	the University of Oklahoma Health Science Center's department of
