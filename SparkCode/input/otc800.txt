     1	February 10, 1991, Boston, MA - Output Technology Corporation (OUTPUT) is
     2	demonstrating its new 800 cps office printer with a wide range of standard
     3	features, plus flexible paper handling capabilities. The MTP is designed
     4	for office printing jobs, as well as document-on-demand, point-of-sale,
     5	and graphics applications.
     6	
     7	"The MTP is really a multiple task printer," said John Lugviel, OUTPUT's
     8	Vice President of Marketing and Sales. "It has excellent paper handling
     9	capabilities, and because of this, it can do a lot of jobs that the
    10	typical printer just can't handle. For businesses that need a single
    11	printer to handle a wide variety of applications, it's an exceptional
    12	value at $2,195!"
    13	
    14	The key to the printer's versatility lies in its advanced paper handling
    15	features. The MTP, an impact printer, has full forms capabilities,
    16	including l-button zero tear off (eliminating forms waste), a standard
    17	push tractor for forms up to 6 parts, and paper parking, as well as
    18	options for a bottom feed pull tractor and a cut sheet feeder. The
    19	printer's auto head gap automatically adjusts to a form's thickness,
    20	completely eliminating the need for any manual adjustments.
    21	
    22	The MTP also excels at graphics and bar codes, and features 9 resident
    23	fonts, more than any other printer in its class. It also has 5 resident
    24	bar codes (Code 39, UPC-A, EAN-8, EAN-13, Interleaved 2 of 5), and
    25	built-in color capabilities. Emulations include Epson, FX-1050, Epson
    26	EX-1000 (color), and IBM Proprinter III XL. With a suggested retail price
    27	of $2,195, the MTP is available for shipment now.

    30	manufacturer, and is a leader in laser and impact printing technology, and
