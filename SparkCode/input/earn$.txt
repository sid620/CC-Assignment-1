     5	 Thank you for taking the time to read this valuable information.
     6	
     7	 Matrix software company has chosen to market it's shareware club  memberships
     8	 through a network of individuals (called sponsors) who have decided to join us
     9	 in our effort to make this Automated ShareWare Catalog System a huge success.
    10	
    11	 WHY NETWORK MARKETING?
    12	
    13	 Network marketing  has come a long way since it was introduced in  the  early
    14	 60's. Of all the business enterprises in America, multi-level marketing (MLM)
    15	 offers  the  highest  potential  with the smallest  risk.
    16	
    17	 Only with  network  marketing can an average person start with  virtually  no
    18	 money, no experience, and no training and begin a home-based business that can
    19	 start producing an income within a matter of a few days.
    20	
    21	 John Naisbitt,  author  of Megatrends,  calls networking one of the ten  best
    22	 opportunities for growth from now through the 21st century. With corporations
    23	 such as U.S. Sprint,  Rexall,  Ralston Purina, and MCI turning to networking,
    24	 skeptics are  beginning  to  take a much closer  look  at  the  opportunities
    25	 available through multi-level marketing.
    26	
    27	 With a multi-level marketing plan such as this, Matrix SoftWare Company builds
    28	 a network   of satisfied  customers and offers   them the opportunity to earn
    29	 money by introducing others to the service.  We save advertising dollars  and
    30	 you earn money, lots of money if you're willing to work a little.
    31	
    32	 Here's how it works.
    33	
    34	 As an ASC club member, you are permitted to sponsor other's into the club and
    35	 earn commission from the dues and the purchases made by members you sponsor.
    36	
    37	 As an incentive for you to help the people you sponsor to sponsor  additional
    38	 members, you  will  also earn commission from their sales and from  those  of
    39	 members for nine levels down from you.
    40	
    41	 This can  be a substantial amount of money if you are willing to put  just  a
    42	 small amount of effort into it.
    43	
    44	 Commissions are calculated and paid through what we call a commission matrix.
    45	
    46	 The matrix is 9 levels deep and each level has a specific number of slots  to
    47	 be filled with paying members.  Sponsors earn commission on monthly dues  and
    48	 ShareWare purchases made by all downline members in their commission matrix.
    49	
    50	 The first level of the commission matrix has 3 commission slots,  the next 9,
    51	 the next 27 the next 81 and so on.
    52	
    53	 Sponsor's are  required  to  have 3 personally sponsored  members    in their
    54	 commission matrix to qualify for commission.
    55	
    56	 Once you have qualified,  you will earn commission  from  all purchases made
    57	 by all down-line members in your commission matrix from now on!
    58	
    59	 To illustrate  the  tremendous earning potential of this  marketing  program,
    60	 we will need to make some assumptions.
    61	
    62	 Let's assume  that  the average monthly dues and purchases from all  of  your
    63	 down-line members  is  $2.89  and that over a period  of  time,  through your
    64	 efforts and those of other sponsors in your matrix,  each commission slot has
    65	 an active member.
    66	
    67	 This is how the commission check would be calculated.
    68	
    69	                         MAXIMUM      TOTAL               YOUR
    70	                LEVEL    MEMBERS      SALES    x 6%  = COMMISSION
    71	                  1           3        $8.67              $0.52
    72	                  2           9       $26.01              $1.56
    73	                  3          27       $78.03              $4.68
    74	                  4          81      $234.09             $14.05
    75	                  5         243      $702.27             $42.14
    76	                  6         729     $2106.81            $126.41
    77	                  7        2187     $6320.43            $379.23
    78	                  8        6561    $18961.29           $1137.68
    79	                  9       19683    $56883.87           $3413.03
    80	                          =====                         =======
    81	                          29523               TOTAL > $5,119.30 per month.
    82	
    83	
    84	 Now remember, we're talking about an average purchase of only $2.89 per month
    85	 from each  of  your  down  line members.  If some members  buy  more  than  1
    86	 program/month, then your commission would be higher.
    87	
    88	 With this limited size commission matrix,  the maximum number of members  you
    89	 can earn commission on at any one time is 29,523.
    90	
    91	 This limitation is actually to your advantage when it comes to earning money.
    92	
    93	 Because of the maximum member limitation on each level,  when a level becomes
    94	 full, the  extra sales will spill down to the next level in the matrix to the
    95	 first open commission slot.
    96	
    97	 This means that you can actually end up earning commission from the sales  of
    98	 sponsors ABOVE  you in the matrix,  as well as from those below you.
    99	
   100	 Take a look at the diagrams below.
   101	
   102	 Let's say your sponsor signed YOU, BILL and JOE on his first level.
   103	
   104	                                         Your Sponsor
   105	                                              ³
   106	                         ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÅÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿

   108	 Sponsor's 1st level    YOU                  BILL                  JOE
   109	
   110	 Then before you got around to sponsoring anyone,  your sponsor (or a  sponsor
   111	 above him) signed up ANN and TOM.
   112	
   113	 Remember, we  process  orders on our computer in the exact sequence  that  we
   114	 receive them.
   115	
   116	 The program we use will automatically credit the sale to the sponsor listed on
   117	 the  order  form.
   118	
   119	 It will position new members into the sponsoring members matrix by starting at
   120	 the sponsors 1st position (top row of his/her matrix) then by moving from top
   121	 to bottom and left to right, the computer will find the first open position.
   122	
   123	
   124	                                         Your Sponsor
   125	                                              ³

   130	                   ³     ³
   131	 Your 1st level   ANN   TOM
   132	
   133	
   134	
   135	 In our example your sponsor's 1st level (limited to 3 members) is full, so ANN
   136	 and TOM would be positioned into your sponsor's 2nd level which is your 1st.
   137	
   138	 When YOU sponsor your 3 (indicated by the X's in your 1st and 2nd levels) two
   139	 of them will spill down to your 2nd level and into ANN's 1st level.
   140	
   141	                                         Your Sponsor
   142	                                              ³
   143	                         ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÅÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿

   150	                 ³ ³
   151	 Your 2nd level  X X
   152	
   153	 This chain reaction effect means that you could be very pleasantly  surprised
   154	 when your first commission check arrives and you discover that even though you
   155	 have only  signed a handful of members,  someone in the matrix above you  has
   156	 signed enough new members so that some have spilled down into your matrix.
   157	
   158	 All you  need  to do is find three people who want to save money  on  quality
   159	 ShareWare for their computing needs. How hard can that be ?
   160	
   161	 There is a bit more to it than just finding three people.
   162	
   163	 As a sponsor you will be required to make and distribute updated catalog disks
   164	 twice a year to all members in your matrix that you have personally sponsored.
   165	
   166	 You must also be willing to help your sponsored members with questions  about
   167	 the use of the ShareWare catalog and/or sponsoring new members.
   168	
   169	 After we  receive  an order,  we will process it and ship the  program  disks
   170	 directly to the member.  You never have to worry about stocking inventory  or
   171	 collecting money.
   172	
   173	 To help you keep track of your down-line sales and network  of  sponsors,  we
   174	 send you a genealogy report with each commission check.
   175	
   176	 The report  will  provide you with with  name,  address,  phone  number,  and
   177	 purchase amount for the first three commission levels in your matrix.
   178	
   179	 All new members orders and sponsors agreements are entered into our  computer
   180	 for positioning in the matrix in the exact order that they are received.
   181	
   182	 This means that the sooner you decide to become a member and a  sponsor,  the
   183	 better your chances are to have other members end up in your matrix.
   184	
   185	 Your commission  check will indicate the total number of downline members  in
   186	 your matrix.
   187	
   188	 Commission checks  are computed and mailed on or before the last day  of  the
   189	 month following the month in which the orders are received. When our computer
   190	 calculates commissions the guidelines are as follows.
   191	
   192	 1. The  computer checks to see that the sponsor has at least three personally
   193	    sponsored active members in his/her matrix. If no, program moves on to the
   194	    next sponsor, if yes, computations continue.
   195	
   196	 2. If the three qualifying spawns were found the program will continue adding
   197	    up  the  sales for  all  nine levels. Your commission report will indicate
   198	    the amount sales on each level, total commission being paid for the period
   199	    and total commission earned year to date.
   200	
   201	 Commission due  for  amounts less than $10 will be carried over to  the  next
   202	 period except in the case of membership termination where total commission due
   203	 will be paid to the member.
   204	
   205	 There will be a 2% accounting fee deducted from all commission checks.
   206	
   207	 Sponsors will receive a form 1099 at the end of the year for use in computing
   208	 taxes owed.
   209	
   210	 Obviously we  can not and will not guarantee any certain level of  income  to
   211	 those who  participate in our marketing plan.  What you can earn will  depend
   212	 mostly on the amount of effort you are willing to put into the  program.
   213	
   214	 There is no minimum purchase required of sponsors or members however you must
   215	 be a  member in order to sponsor others into the club and you  must  maintain
   216	 your membership  in good standing to retain your established position in  the
   217	 matrix.
   218	
   219	 If you have any questions about becoming a member/sponsor, please feel free to
   220	 contact your sponsor or Matrix Software Company.
   221	
   222	 To sign  up as a sponsor,  you must sign and return one copy of the  sponsors
   223	 agreement to Matrix SoftWare.  You will be give the opportunity to print  the
   224	 agreement when you exit this section.
   225	
   226	 All ASC club members are assigned a unique members record number (MRN).
   227	
   228	 After we receive the agreement we will send you a special sponsors master disk
   229	 with your name and MRN on it.  You should use this disk for making additional
   230	 ASC disks to give out to prospective members.  When orders are processed with
   231	 your name and MRN you will automatically receive credit for the sale.
