     7	 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     8	 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    10				    Preamble
    11	
    12	  The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users
    13	at the mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our General Public
    14	License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
    15	software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  The
    16	General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation's
    17	software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.
    18	You can use it for your programs, too.
    19	
    20	  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    21	price.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make
    22	sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free
    23	software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
    24	that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
    25	programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    26	
    27	  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    28	anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
    29	These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    30	distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    31	
    32	  For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether
    33	gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
    34	you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
    35	source code.  And you must tell them their rights.
    36	
    37	  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
    38	(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
    39	distribute and/or modify the software.
    40	
    41	  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
    42	that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    43	software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
    44	want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
    45	that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
    46	authors' reputations.
    47	
    48	  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    49	modification follow.
    50	
    51			    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    52	   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    53	
    54	  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
    55	contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
    56	distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The
    57	"Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based
    58	on the Program" means either the Program or any work containing the
    59	Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each
    60	licensee is addressed as "you".
    61	
    62	  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
    63	code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
    64	appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
    65	disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
    66	General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
    67	other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License
    68	along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of
    69	transferring a copy.
    70	
    71	  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
    72	it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph
    73	1 above, provided that you also do the following:
    74	
    75	    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
    76	    you changed the files and the date of any change; and
    77	
    78	    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that
    79	    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either
    80	    with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all
    81	    third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except
    82	    that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all
    83	    third parties, at your option).
    84	
    85	    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
    86	    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
    87	    in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an
    88	    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
    89	    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
    90	    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
    91	    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General
    92	    Public License.
    93	
    94	    d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
    95	    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
    96	    exchange for a fee.
    97	
    98	Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its
    99	derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
   100	the other work under the scope of these terms.
   101	
   102	  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of
   103	it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
   104	Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
   105	
   106	    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
   107	    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
   108	    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
   109	
   110	    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
   111	    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge
   112	    for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the
   113	    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
   114	    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
   115	
   116	    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the
   117	    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is
   118	    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
   119	    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)
   120	
   121	Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   122	modifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means
   123	all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special
   124	exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard
   125	libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable
   126	file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that
   127	accompany that operating system.
   128	
   129	  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
   130	Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License.
   131	Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer
   132	the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use
   133	the Program under this License.  However, parties who have received
   134	copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public
   135	License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
   136	remain in full compliance.
   137	
   138	  5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based
   139	on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,
   140	and all its terms and conditions.
   141	
   142	  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
   143	Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
   144	licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these
   145	terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the
   146	recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
   147	
   148	  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
   149	of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
   150	be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   151	address new problems or concerns.
   152	
   153	Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
   154	specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and "any
   155	later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
   156	either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
   157	Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
   158	the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
   159	Foundation.
   160	
   161	  8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
   162	programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
   163	to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
   164	Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
   165	make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
   166	of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
   167	of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
   168	
   169				    NO WARRANTY
   170	
   171	  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
   172	FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
   173	OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
   174	PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
   175	OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   176	MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
   177	TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
   178	PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
   179	REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
   180	
   181	  10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   182	WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
   183	REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
   184	INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
   185	OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
   186	TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
   187	YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
   188	PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
   189	POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
   190	
   191			     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
   192	
   193		Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
   194	
   195	  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
   196	possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it
   197	free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
   198	terms.
   199	
   200	  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
   201	attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
   202	the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
   203	"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
   204	
   205	    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
   206	    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>
   207	
   208	    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
   209	    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
   210	    the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)
   211	    any later version.
   212	
   213	    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
   214	    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
   215	    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
   216	    GNU General Public License for more details.
   217	
   218	    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
   219	    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
   220	    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
   221	
   222	Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
   223	
   224	If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
   225	when it starts in an interactive mode:
   226	
   227	    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author
   228	    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
   229	    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
   230	    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
   231	
   232	The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
   233	appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
   234	commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
   235	c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
   236	program.
   237	
   238	You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
   239	school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
   240	necessary.  Here a sample; alter the names:
   241	
   242	  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
   243	  program `Gnomovision' (a program to direct compilers to make passes
   244	  at assemblers) written by James Hacker.

   246	  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
   247	  Ty Coon, President of Vice
