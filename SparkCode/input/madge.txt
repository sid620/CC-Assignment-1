     1	SAN JOSE, CA (February 4, 1992)--Madge Networks, Inc., a leading supplier
     2	of high performance token ring networking products, today introduced the
     3	Fastmac Toolkit. The Toolkit enables developers and high volume users to
     4	write custom, PC-based token ring applications and drivers for Madge 16/4
     5	token ring adapter cards. 
     6	
     7	"With the Fastmac Toolkit, developers can create applications and special
     8	purpose drivers for Madge adapter cards that will fully exploit the
     9	ability of Madge's Fastmac technology to provide performance four to five
    10	times faster than using standard Texas Instruments'-based BASIC MAC
    11	software," said Stephen Thomas, vice president of products and technology,
    12	Madge Networks. "This product will assist developers who work on mission
    13	critical network computing devices such as routers, host communications
    14	gateways and network analyzers, where optimized performance is critical 
    15	to exploit the exceptionally high performance of Madge adapter cards."
    16	
    17	Fastmac is a software module, developed by Madge, that runs on the TI token
    18	chipset and optimizes the data transfer rates between the network and the
    19	host processor. Madge recently signed a license agreement with TI giving
    20	Madge full nonexclusive development rights to enhance the MAC software of
    21	TI's token ring chipset. Madge makes use of the Fastmac technology in its
    22	own high performance driver software and has licensed it for use in other
    23	high performance token ring network products such as those by Cisco
    24	Systems, SynOptics Communications, ADC/Fibermux, and Xircom.
    25	
    26	"TI is pleased to see vendors such as Madge give developers the tools they
    27	need to obtain maximum throughput and value from the TI TMS380C16 built-in
    28	communications processor," said Leon Adams, open systems marketing
    29	manager, Texas Instruments.
    30	
    31	The Fastmac Toolkit contains a full set of support software for Fastmac
    32	running on Madge 16/4 adapter cards. It includes operating system
    33	independent C language source code, sample applications, and full
    34	documentation. It supports the Madge Smart 16/4 AT Ringnode and Smart 16/4
    35	PC Ringnode products. Pricing and Availability
