     1	ATLANTA, GA, 20 January 1992 -- Hayes Microcomputer Products, Inc. today
     2	announced immediate availability of Smartmodem OPTIMA 2400 (OPTIMA 24), a
     3	cost effective solution for business and personal communications that
     4	provides CCITT V.42 error-control and V.42 bis data compression for data
     5	throughput up to 9600 bps. Hayes also lowered the price of Smartmodem
     6	OPTIMA 9600 (OPTIMA 96), a CCITT V.32 modem, by approximately 20 percent.
     7	
     8	OPTIMA 24 supports CCITT V.22 bis (2400 bps), CCITT V.22 (1200 bps), as
     9	well as industry standards 103 (300 bps) and 212A (1200 bps). OPTIMA 24
    10	communicates asynchronously and synchronously, as well as supports Hayes
    11	AutoSync, a standard Smartmodem feature that allows the modem to
    12	communicate both asynchronously and synchronously, without using an SDLC
    13	card.
    14	
    15	While Hayes does not publish an estimated retail price for OPTIMA products,
    16	both OPTIMA 24 and OPTIMA 96 are available to the distribution channel at
    17	an aggressive price that encourages a market price well below that of
    18	competitive products. The current advertised price range of OPTIMA 24 is
    19	$149 to $199, while the current advertised price range of OPTIMA 96 is
    20	$349 to $429. Prices may vary based on the level of value-added service a
    21	reseller provides to their customers.
    22	
    23	"At Hayes, we believe we should be our own best competitor. With OPTIMA 24,
    24	we reinforce our commitment to providing the latest technology to all
    25	sectors of the communications market," said Hayes President Dennis C.
    26	Hayes. "If you liked the price of OPTIMA 96 in 1991, you'll love the price
    27	of both OPTIMA 96 and OPTIMA 24 in 1992. OPTIMA 24 offers a perfect
    28	migration for companies that have standardized on Smartmodem 2400 and now
    29	want data compression and error-control."
    30	
    31	OPTIMA 24 and OPTIMA 96 come bundled with Smartcom EZ communications
    32	software and a special $35 upgrade offer for Smartcom Exec as well as
    33	valuable information services coupons.
    34	
    35	Smartcom EZ is a simple-to-use communications software program that enables
    36	users to access PCs and on-line or BBS services. Smartcom EZ provides
    37	easy-to-follow menus and phone book entries to store frequently called
    38	numbers, keyboard macros, extensive on-line help screens and Autotype,
    39	which enables users to transfer text files effortlessly. Furthermore, the
    40	XMODEM protocol allows users to send or receive data files error-free
    41	between locations.
    42	
    43	Both OPTIMA 24 and OPTIMA 96 are available in the U.S. and Canada, and
    44	carry a two year limited performance warranty. While OPTIMA 96 is
    45	currently available throughout Latin America, Hayes anticipates the
    46	approval and availability of OPTIMA 24 in Latin America over the next few
    47	months.
