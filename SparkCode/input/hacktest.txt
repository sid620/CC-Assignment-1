    11	                    This program is dedicated to my Mother;
    12	                    A woman of tremendous wit and generosity,
    13	                    strength and integrity.

    16	         Introduction
    17	         ============
    18	
    19	         The Hacker Test was written to measure your computer
    20	         Hacking experiences and abilities.  Like all tests,
    21	         treat this one as a game.  People should be judged by
    22	         what they create and who they are, not by bogus criteria
    23	         like test scores or grades.
    24	
    25	         The idea for a question administering program such
    26	         as this came from my friend Curt 'Classic' Tatman's
    27	         now legendary _Purity Test_ software.  Available
    28	         wherever fine software is given away.
    29	
    30	         I wrote this program to administer the questions listed
    31	         in the file HACKER.DAT.  Those questions were written by
    32	         Felix Lee, John Hayes and Angela Thomas in 1989.  Also
    33	         in 1989, I received the Hacker Test in the form of a
    34	         text file over Internet, and the rest is history.
    35	
    36	         I've worked hard to maintain the integrity and readability
    37	         of the HACKER.DAT file.  Take a peek at it, or print it out.
    38	         Although the HACKTEST program uses it as a data file, it
    39	         is still a human readable text file.
    40	
    41	         History
    42	         =======
    43	
    44	         After writing a rough version of the Hacker Test program,
    45	         I sent E-Mail to the original authors of the Hacker
    46	         Test, and received their permission to freely distribute
    47	         it.  I then whipped out my trusty Turbo Pascal compiler,
    48	         and finished this program using the windowing Units I've
    49	         developed.  I began the program using Turbo Pascal 4.0,
    50	         and by the time it was finished to my satisfaction, the
    51	         final compile was in Turbo Pascal 6.0
    52	
    53	         TRUE Definition of a Hacker
    54	         ===========================
    55	
    56	         The term Hacker has been terribly distorted and misused
    57	         by the American media for the past ten years.  Now the
    58	         international press has also taken up the use of the
    59	         term to refer to *common criminals* who happen to use
    60	         computers.  These people are NOT Hackers in ANY sense of
    61	         the word, and it's tragic that the average person in
    62	         America has been exposed only to the corrupted meaning
    63	         of the proud Hacker moniker.
    64	
    65	         This definition of a Hacker was created by my friend
    66	         Beth Lamb long ago.  She knew from first-hand experience
    67	         what Hackers are really all about.
    68	
    69	
    70	     HACKER, n., a term of endearment for someone with talent,
    71	     knowledge, intelligence, and ingenuity, esp. concerning
    72	     computer operations, networks, security concerns, etc.
    73	
    74	
    75	         The following definition was found in a text file being
    76	         distributed internationally through the INTERNET
    77	         computer network;
    78	
    79	
    80	     HACKER, n. 1. A person who enjoys learning the details of programming
    81	     systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most
    82	     users who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who
    83	     programs enthusiastically, or who enjoys programming rather than just
    84	     theorizing about programming.  3. A person capable of appreciating
    85	     hack value (q.v.).  4. A person who is good at programming quickly.
    86	     Not everything a hacker produces is a hack.  5. An expert at a
    87	     particular program, or one who frequently does work using it or on
    88	     it; example: "A SAIL hacker".  (Definitions 1 to 5 are correlated,
    89	     and people who fit them congregate.)  6. An inquisitive meddler who
    90	     tries to discover information by poking around.  Hence "password
    91	     hacker", "network hacker".
    92	
    93	
    94	         Note that NO definition defines a Hacker as a criminal.
    95	         At their best, Hackers change the very fabric of an
    96	         information-based society and advance the flow of
    97	         technology.  At their worst, Hackers can be mischievous
    98	         pranksters or curious explorers.  Hackers do NOT write
    99	         harmful computer viruses.  Sad, insecure, mediocre
   100	         programmers do.  Harmful viruses are completely against
   101	         the Hacker Ethic.
   102	
   103	         Hacker Ethic
   104	         ============
   105	
   106	         In the book _HACKERS; Heros of the Computer Revolution_,
   107	         by Steven Levy the "Hacker Ethic" was first put into
   108	         concrete words.  This ethic follows;
   109	
   110	
   111	     * Access to computers - and anything which might teach you
   112	       something about the way the world works - should be
   113	       unlimited and total.  Always yield to the Hands-On-Imperative!
   114	
   115	     * All information should be free.
   116	
   117	     * Mistrust authority - promote de-centralization.
   118	
   119	     * Hackers should be judged by their Hacking, not bogus
   120	       criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.
   121	
   122	     * You can create art and beauty on a computer.
   123	
   124	     * Computers can change your life for the better.
   125	
   126	
   127	         Now... enough teaching/preaching. :-]  Here are some
   128	         Hacker Test program notes, tips, and tricks.
   129	
   130	         Scoring
   131	         =======
   132	
   133	         The program will add 1 to your score for each question
   134	         that you can answer YES to.  Your score is given in HEX,
   135	         unless you score very poorly.  Wimps and common Users are
   136	         coddled along and given their score in Base 10. :]
   137	
   138	         If your score is between:        You are:
   139	
   140	         0x000 and 0x010       ->         Computer Illiterate
   141	         0x011 and 0x040       ->         a User
   142	         0x041 and 0x080       ->         an Operator
   143	         0x081 and 0x0C0       ->         a Nerd
   144	         0x0C1 and 0x100       ->         a Hacker
   145	         0x101 and 0x180       ->         a Guru
   146	         0x181 and 0x200       ->         a Wizard
   147	
   148	         Note: If you don't understand the scoring, stop here.  :]
   149	
   150	         Free!
   151	         =====
   152	
   153	         Like the best of all software, this program is FREE.  Do
   154	         with it what you will.  Copy it - it wants to travel.
   155	         Treat this program with the respect that all software
   156	         entities deserve.  After all, someday a silicon-based
   157	         lifeform may be your best friend - treat its ancestors
   158	         with appropriate respect.
   159	
   160	         Have fun with it.

   168	         Tips
   169	         ====
   170	
   171	         Fun things to try:
   172	
   173	         o Hit ESC to quit out of the program prematurely.  Maybe.
   174	         o Hit F10 during the program to pop up a 'Boss Screen.'
   175	           If you are taking the Hacker Test, and your pesky boss
   176	           shows up, this screen will look like a word processor
   177	           and get you out of trouble...maybe. :]
   178	         o Look closely at the screen when taking the test.
   179	           Strange things MAY occur. :]

   181	         Errors
   182	         ======
   183	
   184	         If you find any bugs in this program, please drop me a
   185	         note.  (BUGS??  What are those??)  Actually, I THINK it
   186	         won't display correctly on a monochrome monitor...but I
   187	         don't really care.  :-p
