    17	  TITLE:
    18	      WINDOWS 3.0 in enhanced mode and STACKER
    19	
    20	  OVERVIEW:
    21	      WINDOWS is a memory-intensive program.  It can be run in enhanced mode to
    22	      take advantage of extended memory, and such operation is compatible with
    23	      STACKER.
    24	
    25	  ISSUES/COMMENTS:
    26	      1) When the XT/8 coprocessor board is present, its address range must be
    27	         excluded in the WINDOWS SYSTEM.INI file.  Overlooking this step can
    28	         lead to corruption of the Windows directory.  Omitting the EMMExclude
    29	         can also lead to "Insufficient Memory" errors when launching Windows
    30	         programs.
    31	         Use of the AT/16 coprocessor presents no such problems.
    32	
    33	      2) Permanent swap files cannot reside on the STACKER volume; (Windows
    34	         does not present it as an option).
    35	
    36	      3) Temporary swap files should also reside on the uncompressed drive.
    37	
    38	      4) With third party (non-Microsoft) memory managers, certain files
    39	         must exist in the identical directory paths on both the compressed
    40	         Stacker drive and in the uncompressed boot drive.

    43	              -----------      ------------        ------------
    44	              386MAX.SYS       BLUEMAX.SYS         QEMM386.SYS
    45	              386LOAD.SYS      385LOAD.SYS         LOADHI.SYS

    47	
    48	  RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
    49	      1) If WINDOWS is run in enhanced mode AND the XT/8 coprocessor board is
    50	         installed, add an EMMExclude statement to WINDOWS\SYSTEM.INI under the
    51	         heading [386ENH] (see User's Manual, "Microsoft Windows 3.0 in 386
    52	         Enhanced Mode Users").  This should be done BEFORE WINDOWS is loaded,
    53		 and can be accomplished using any text editor.  (If the coprocessor is
    54	         disabled, SYSTEM.INI may be modified using NOTEPAD.)
    55	 
    56	      2) If a permanent swap file will be part of the configuration, leave
    57	         sufficient uncompressed space on the host volume.  If there is not 
    58		 enough uncompressed space and you have Stacker version 2.0 or greater,
    59		 use SDEFRAG to physically shrink the STACVOL file.
    60	         If you are using version 1.12 or lower,the STACKER volume must be 
    61	         SREMOVEd, and a smaller one created.
    62	
    63	      3) Temporary swap files left on the uncompressed drive will not cause
    64	         fragmentation in the STACKER volume.
    65	
    66	      4) If the STACKER volume becomes corrupted or write-protected due to an
    67	         interrupted 386-enhanced session:
    68	          a) verify that STACKER coprocessor card address has been excluded in
    69	             SYSTEM.INI;
    70	          b) run SCHECK/F on the STACKER volume;
    71	          c) delete the WIN386.SWP (temporary swap) file;
    72	          d) run SCHECK/F again;
    73	          e) reboot before writing anything to disk.
