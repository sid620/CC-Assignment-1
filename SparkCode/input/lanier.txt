     1	Virtual  Reality  (VR)  has moved from the California labs to find itself in the
     2	public eye. Various exhibits and  'Cyberthons',  numerous  articles,  television
     3	spots, (WGBH's NOVA and National Geographic) have brought this infant technology
     4	to the mainstream .
     5	
     6	VR  proves  to  be  a  powerful  medium of the future.  Unlike present media, VR
     7	relies and functions best as a creative tool, not passive mind control.

    21	Interview with JARON LANIER
    22	from Omni, January 1991
    23	
    24	           \--------------------------+-------------------------/
    25	
    26	On the living room wall of Jaron Lanier's  disheveled  bungalow  in  Palo  Alto,
    27	California,  hangs a poster of the four-armed Hindu goddess Kali. Her 16 fingers
    28	and 4 thumbs dexterously play a sitar. Most Westerners would find the  image  an
    29	exotic  one,  but in the context of virtual reality, the emerging field of which
    30	Lanier is the unquestioned guru, Kali looks as normal as Betty Crocker.  Virtual
    31	(artificial)  reality  is  the  hot new computer technology that lets you do the
    32	impossible - from swimming through the heart's  aorta  to  walking  the  dog  on
    33	Saturn's  rings.  Technically  virtual  reality is a full-color, full-motion 3-D
    34	environment manu factured by computer and displayed inside  a  pair  of  goggles
    35	worn  by  the  virtual  traveler.  Psychologically  it's  poised  to  become  an
    36	open-ended, no-holds-barred experience that enables people to create  their  own
    37	dreams in Technicolor and then let their frie nds jump in.
    38	
    39	VPL  Research,  Inc., of which Lanier is the founder, CEO, and spiritual leader,
    40	is the first company to bring virtual reality technology to  the  market.  VPL's
    41	customers  include  NASA,  Apple  Computer,  Pacific  Bell, and an assortment of
    42	universities and rese arch labs. On a visit to VPL's offices  overlooking  swank
    43	Redwood  City  sailboat marina, interviewer Doug Stewart explored a sample world
    44	that Lanier had spent  barely  an  hour  mousing  together  on  a  Macintosh  II
    45	computer. To enter this world, Stewart pulled a pair of VPL's cumbersome, opaque
    46	EyePhones  and  a  wired-up Data-Glove made of black Lycra. Sensors on the glove
    47	and goggles steadily sent a silent  flood  of  signals  to  a  powerful  Silicon
    48	Graphics  computer  sitting  on the floor. Stewart instantly found himse lf in a
    49	room filled with semifamiliar objects: a red  apple  on  a  table,  a  bunch  of
    50	purple  grapes, a banana spinning lazily end over end in midair, a yellow rubber
    51	duck bobbing in a rippling water of a hot tub. Periodically a small  pterodactyl
    52	swooped down a spiraling chimney and out of the room.
    53	
    54	"Reach  for the grapes," Lanier suggested to Stewart, who groped with his gloved
    55	hand and watched as a virtual representation of his bending  fingers  closed  on
    56	the  bunch.  He  moved his fist, and then the grapes moved with it. Leaning back
    57	in  satisfaction,  Stewart  saw  the  room  abruptly  enveloped  in  red.   He's
    58	accidentally  backed  his  head  into the apple. In minutes Stewart had mastered
    59	the "fly!" gesture  (pointing  a  gloved  forefinger  while  curling  the  thumb
    60	under),  rocketed  up  the chimney, and was soaring thr ough the gray billows of
    61	distant computer-generated cloud.
    62	
    63	A self-taught thirty-year-old with neither a college  nor  high-school  diploma,
    64	Lanier  is,  not  surprisingly,  a  onetime video game designer. Virtual reality
    65	(VR), however, promises to be much more than the ultimate  wraparound  adventure
    66	game.   VR   systems   wou   ld   be   the  perfect  command  post  for  sending
    67	remote-controlled robots where humans prefer not to go  (a  melted-down  nuclear
    68	reactor,  the asteroid belt). Medical students could practice surgery on virtual
    69	cadavers that spurt virtual blood after a misplaced in  cision.  Such  uses  are
    70	speculative so far, but few people doubt the technology's potential.
    71	
    72	No  one  offers more enthusiastic speculation than Lanier. A champion of virtual
    73	reality as a key to unlocking humankind's imagination, Lanier  is  probably  the
    74	first  man  with  full-length  dreadlocks to be profiled on page one of The Wall
    75	Street Journal. Bea rlike, with heavy-lidded blue eyes  and  a  soft,  sometimes
    76	dreamy  voice, Lanier dominates a room. Stewart interviewed him over five hectic
    77	days and nights punctuated by midnight drives, unexpected visits by  delegations
    78	of Japanese industrialists, sudden aft ernoon naps, dinners with computer moguls
    79	eager to pick Lanier's brain, and the occasional 5:OO A.M. staff meeting.
    80	
    81	Lanier,  the  hacker-turned-capitalist,  struck  Stewart  as  more  hacker  than
    82	capitalist.  With  breathtaking  nonchalance,   Lanier   disregarded   scheduled
    83	appointments  and  housekeeping  details  (he  even  had his unlisted home phone
    84	inexplicably disconnected midweek ) or changing clothes over the course of  five
    85	days.  Most  of  the  interviews  took  place  in  the living room of his rented
    86	bungalow. Lanier is an accomplished improvisational musician, and the  room  was
    87	crowded  with  more  than  1OO  instruments,  from  bagpipes  to  xylophones  to
    88	unidentified horns and gourds. During breaks Lanier repaired to his grand  piano
    89	and sent fluent, atonal chords crashing through the room.
    90	
    91	The  Pied  Piper  of  a  growing  technological  cult,  Lanier  has  many of the
    92	trappings of a young rock star: the nocturnal activity, attention-getting  hair,
    93	incessant  demands  on  his time. He is casual, giggly, his heedlessness verging
    94	at times on arrogance. Y et during the interviews he seemed oddly unspontaneous.
    95	When he found something amusing, which  was  often,  he  paused  a  beat  before
    96	issuing  a  staccato  burst  of  giggles.  Hearing  good  news  on the phone, he
    97	screamed in delight but hesitated before whipping an object across the  room  in
    98	celebration.  (Hmmm. Should I throw this pen or shouldn't I?) Lanier behaved, in
    99	fact, as if he were observing himself from a distance.
   100	
   101	
   102	Omni: What is virtual reality?
   103	
   104	Lanier: It's an alternate reality filling the same  niche  otherwise  filled  by
   105	physical  reality. It's created when people wear a kind of computerized clothing
   106	over the sense organs. If  you  generate  enough  stimuli  outside  one's  sense
   107	organs  to  indicate  the  e xistence of a particular alternate world, then that
   108	person's nervous system will kick into gear and treat that stimulated  world  as
   109	real.  You might be in a Moorish temple, or a heart that's pumping. You might be
   110	watching a representation of hydrogen bonds forming. In each case the  world  is
   111	entirely  computer generated. Now, imagine that you had the power to change that
   112	would quickly - without limitations. If you suddenly wanted to make  the  planet
   113	three  times larger, put a crystal cave in the middle with a g iant goat bladder
   114	pulsing inside of that and tiny cities populating the  goat  bladder's  surface,
   115	and  running  between  each of the cities were solid gold railways carrying tiny
   116	gerbils playing accordions - you could build that world instead of talking about
   117	it!
   118	
   119	Omni: Okay.... How does the computerized clothing work?
   120	
   121	Lanier: The goggles put a small TV in front  of  each  eye  so  you  see  moving
   122	images  in  three  dimensions. That's only the beginning. There is one key trick
   123	that makes VR work: The goggles have a sensor allowing a computer to tell  where
   124	your  head is facing. Wh at you see is created completely by the computer, which
   125	generates a new image every twentieth of a second. When you  move  you  head  to
   126	the  left, the computer uses that information to shift the scene that you see to
   127	the right to compensate. This creates the illusion  that  your  head  is  moving
   128	freely  in a stationary external space. If you put on a glove and hold your hand
   129	in front of your face, you see a computer-generated hand in the  virtual  world.
   130	If you wiggle your fingers, you see its fingers wiggle. The gl ove allows you to
   131	reach  out and pick up an artificial object, say a ball, and throw it. Your ears
   132	are covered with earphones. The computer can process sounds, either  synthesized
   133	or  natural, so that they seem to come from a particular direction. If you see a
   134	virtual fly buzzing around, that fly will actually sound as though  it's  coming
   135	from  the  right  direction.  We also make a full body suit, a DataSuit, but you
   136	can just have a flying head, which isn't really so bad. The hands and  head  are
   137	the  business  ends  of the body - they interact most with the outside world. If
   138	you wear just goggles and gloves, you can do most of the stuff you want  in  the
   139	virtual world.
   140	
   141	Omni: What about touch?
   142	
   143	Lanier:  VPL is working on developing touch sensors. We've done experiments with
   144	tactile feedback by putting vibration simulators  inside  the  fingertips.  When
   145	you  fingertips  feel vibrations that match what you see in virtual reality, you
   146	associate them with the surface of the virtual object. It's surprising how  many
   147	sensations  you  can create with vibrations alone. Another way to simulate touch
   148	would be with a grid of tiny elements that  move  back  and  forth  like  little
   149	pistons  so  that  the  overall  grid can tak e on shapes. That's tough to build
   150	because it would have to be very thin to fit onto the surface of a glove.  Touch
   151	is  a  very complex activity. Tac-tile sensation is an action; it's not passive.
   152	You're constantly nudging things with your fingers, rubbing,  squeezing  things,
   153	feeling  their  weight  and  textures,  judging  the  position  of  your arm and
   154	fingers, performing hundreds of subtle little  tests.  To  synthesize  the  full
   155	sensation  of  picking  up an object in VR, you'd have to do a number of things,
   156	all difficu lt, some perhaps impossible.
   157	
   158	Omni: Who are your customers?
   159	
   160	Lanier: Most are companies and institutions with their own  technical  know-how.
   161	Some  use VR to test designs before building them. Some are trying to understand
   162	scientific or engineering data better. Some are people who want to have fun.
   163	
   164	Omni: Millionaires who want to play three-D games?
   165	
   166	Lanier: There's only been one example of that so far, which I  don't  encourage.
   167	But  there's  nothing  wrong  with  a  technology  that unites work and play. VR
   168	allows you to do work that you couldn't  do  otherwise  by  making  it  playful.
   169	People in the business worl d are sick of being told that things that aren't fun
   170	are  fun,  like  using a spreadsheet. Virtual reality actually is fun. You might
   171	think of it as a general-purpose simulator, or as a fantasy  machine.  But  what
   172	makes  it so special is that you and others wearing VR clothing can be networked
   173	together to  share  the  same  alternate  reality.  The  content  is  completely
   174	variable  -  you could be on top of Mount Everest or the bottom of the sea - but
   175	the environme nt is the same for everyone in it. You and your  VR  partners  can
   176	shake  hands,  dance  together, play ball. You can construct buildings together.
   177	Virtual reality is an epistemological milestone, a new reality that's shared  as
   178	the physical world is. Yet it is open and unhindered like dreams.
   179	
   180	Omni: What are some applications?
   181	
   182	Lanier:  Each  application  by  itself  is  a  whole-amazing world, so in a way,
   183	anytime you talk about a particular application you're somehow losing  sight  of
   184	the overall picture.
   185	
   186	Omni: Still, don't your customers view it as an efficient  tool  rather  than  a
   187	mindboggling experience?
   188	
   189	Lanier:  Absolutely.  It's extremely efficient. An architect can make a building
   190	real before it exists and bring people through it. In a demo with  Pacific  Bell
   191	recently,  two  architects  got  together over the phone and explored a proposed
   192	day-care center in V R. One showed proposed features to the  other,  they  could
   193	see  each  other  moving  around  in  the room and could make design changes. By
   194	holding the glove a certain way, they could  change  their  bodies  to  take  on
   195	characteristics  of children's bodies. So they we re able to run around and test
   196	features like a water fountain from a child's perspective.  Another  example  is
   197	city  planning.  Tom  Furness  is  heading a lab at the University of Washington
   198	that's studying VR. We're helping them put a version of Seattle in to a VR  that
   199	you  can walk around in. You can add skyscrapers to the skyline to see what they
   200	feel like aesthetically, whose views are blocked, and so on.
   201	
   202	Omni: How can virtual reality advance medical technology?
   203	
   204	Lanier:  We  take  information  about  the human body from scanning machines and
   205	turn it into objects in virtual  reality.  This  means  doctors  can  put  their
   206	patients  through  a  scanner,  then  walk in to virtual reality and pick up the
   207	patient's bones and internal organs. Suppose the patient has a serious deformity
   208	or injury. A surgeon could get a feeling  for  the  three-D  structure  of  that
   209	person's  body  to  help  plan  surgery.  This  is still in the earliest testing
   210	phases, but we've done one project with the San Diego Supercomputer Center where
   211	we had people crawling around inside patients and looking at  the  structure  of
   212	their  brains.  You  can  have two physicians inside the brain at the same time,
   213	and they can talk about what they see. One can point to the structure  and  say,
   214	"There's an abscess here.
   215	
   216	Omni: What's the smallest world anyone's made a virtual visit to?
   217	
   218	Lanier:  Fred  Brook  and  Henry  Fuchs at the University of North Carolina have
   219	done some marvelous work letting chemists pick  up  molecules  whose  atoms  are
   220	about  first  size.  You  can  figure  out  certain chemical problems quicker by
   221	holding on to a sort of robot arm that comes out of the ceiling and pushes  back
   222	at  you  to  simulate  a  molecule's  forces.  So  you  can literally feel where
   223	chemical bonds could occur. A complicated organic molecule is something  like  a
   224	handful  of  little  magnets  in  a  cluster.  Their  forces  combine  to form a
   225	complicated, irregular field. As you move a new magnet  over  the  big  cluster,
   226	sometimes  it's attracted, sometimes repelled. In a sim ilar way, a molecule has
   227	a landscape of atomic forces around it. There might be  little  patches  exactly
   228	complementary,  so  that  two  molecules  will bond at one point. That's easy to
   229	study in simple molecules, but it's much harder  with  large  organic  molecules
   230	like  an  enzyme.  The  systems  that  the  North  Carolina  lab  and others are
   231	developing are tremendous new tools for seeing and feeling how  these  molecules
   232	behave.  Some  mathematicians  and  physicists  are  using it to make intangible
   233	worlds real. We're doing  some  work  with  actuaries.  They  can  fly  over  an
   234	abstract  forest  that  represents  various  insurance statistics. It helps them
   235	notice patters in the data more easily than they could  on  even  a  very  large
   236	computer  screen.  Computer programmers could look at a whole program at once. A
   237	large program might look like a  giant  Christmas  tree,  and  you  could  be  a
   238	hummingbird flying around it. Landing on any one branch, you coul d see in great
   239	detail  the  structure  of  that part of the program. From a distance, you could
   240	learn to plan a very large program spatially.
   241	
   242	Omni: Do people send you suggestions about uses you never dreamed of?
   243	
   244	Lanier: Tons. Some of them are truly crazy. We've had  inquiries  about  putting
   245	animals  in  virtual  reality  from people who design animal clothing. Ministers
   246	call up to ask if we could use VR as a kind of methadone treatment. And  virtual
   247	sex  -  you  should  see  how  stupid  my  mail is on this subject! A lot of the
   248	inquiries don't make any sense, but it's important to be open-minded.
   249	
   250	Omni: The National Enquirer reported that VPL was working on a spy glove.
   251	
   252	Lanier: Yes! [Laughter] They said we were working with the CIA to make  a  robot
   253	resembling  a  severed  hand  that could be remote-controlled by a DataGlove. It
   254	would crawl into enemy territory, climb over fences,  steal  enemy  papers,  and
   255	crawl back. It was sil ly.
   256	
   257	Omni: Could virtual squash someday replace the real thing?
   258	
   259	Lanier:  Absolutely.  Visually  a  simple squash game in low resolution might be
   260	doable right now on an inexpensive system. As  for  force  feedback,  you  could
   261	design  a  robot  that  pushes  back  at  your feet in a particular way. Perhaps
   262	there'd be a robot arm with a racket handle that comes out of  the  wall.  You'd
   263	grab  the  handle, it would jerk back when the ball was hit. When the simulation
   264	is specific like this, you can go all-out and make it good.
   265	
   266	What's hard is to build a general force-feedback machine.  Here  are  some  Rube
   267	Goldberg  examples:  Imagine  having  tiny  rockets  over  your body with little
   268	thrusters that are pushing back and forth at you so that any possible force  can
   269	be applied to any part of you. Or imagine that there are all these little robots
   270	all  around  you,  and like tiny bustlers, whenever you slam your hand down on a
   271	virtual table, they run up to receive your  blow  just  before  your  hand  gets
   272	there.  You  can  take  any  form  you want. You might pull your nose to make it
   273	longer or choose from a drawer of extra snouts or  horns.  You  might  point  to
   274	another  person or animal wandering around in the environment and turn up a knob
   275	that says BLEND and gradually turn into them or something halfway b etween.
   276	
   277	At VPL  we've  often  played  with  becoming  different  creatures  -  lobsters,
   278	gazelles,  winged  angels. Taking on a different body in virtual reality is more
   279	profound than merely putting on a  costume,  because  you're  actually  changing
   280	your body's dynamics.
   281	
   282	What  surprised  us  is  that  people  adapt  almost  instantly  to manipulating
   283	radically different body images. They pick up virtual  objects  just  as  easily
   284	with  a  human  one.  You'd  think your brain is hardwired to know your arm, and
   285	that if suddenly it grew thr ee feet, your brain wouldn't be able to control it,
   286	but that doesn't appear to be true.
   287	
   288	I become curious about how far I could push this, and added fingers to  my  hand
   289	and  limbs to my body. But how do you control this extra limb? Wiggle your nose?
   290	Let's say you want a third, virtual arm in the middle of your  chest.  The  most
   291	obvious  way  to  c  ontrol  it  is  to make its position an average of your two
   292	physical arms, so its thumb is always halfway between your physical  thumbs  and
   293	so  forth. Now, that's moderately interesting, but basically the new arm is just
   294	something that gets in your way. Imagin e a more complicated way of  controlling
   295	it:  a  bodysuit  that's  constantly  making dozens of measurements of different
   296	parts of your body - a little bit of ankle, writs, neck - all convoluted by  the
   297	computer  in a funny algorythm to control how far the elbow in a new virtual arm
   298	is bent at any moment. You've essentially snuck in control of a new  limb  while
   299	letting  each  individual  part  of  your physical body move freely. It's like a
   300	hidden resource.
   301	
   302	Omni: You'd consciously learn to control the new limb?
   303	
   304	Lanier:  It's  too  complex  to  do  consciously.  You'd  learn  to  control  it
   305	intuitively,  by  getting feedback. This suggests that you might help people who
   306	are paralyzed have the experience of walking in virtual reality. Sensors  placed
   307	on  uninjured  parts  of thei r bodies could let them control a complete body in
   308	virtual reality, allowing paralyzed kids to play sports with other  kids.  Would
   309	this  activity  keep  parts  of  the  brain  awake  that might otherwise atrophy
   310	through lack of use? This is completely unknown righ t now. I haven't studied it
   311	as a scientist; I've only hacked it as a technologist. The field is  crying  out
   312	for more study of phenomena like this, which VPL is not set up to do.
   313	
   314	We were thinking of selling a booklet, "1OO Dissertations for 5O Cents."
   315	
   316	Omni: What about vacations, say, in a virtual Maui?
   317	
   318	Lanier:  The  existence  of a virtual Maui will just make the physical Maui that
   319	much more precious and desirable. I don't think virtual reality will ever  serve
   320	as  a  substitute for the physical world. It's not as good. A virtual Maui could
   321	never be a full si mulation. By putting it  into  a  computer,  you  remove  its
   322	mystery; it's blander and clunkier. You turn it into a finite model.
   323	
   324	Omni: Still, you talk about the awesome illusions possible.
   325	
   326	Lanier:  The emotional character of virtual reality is completely different from
   327	that of the physical world. VR is a craft you create. People  say,  "I  want  to
   328	try  virtual  reality because I want the thrill of having these experiences wash
   329	over me," but in fa ct the  experience  is  the  opposite  of  that.  It's  very
   330	intentional.  A  better name for it, actually, might be intentional reality. The
   331	physical world is thrilling because it's infinitely subtle: There's always  more
   332	to  perceive.  It surrounds us with a sea of mystery. Those of us in science and
   333	technology tend to live under the delusion that we mostly understand the  world,
   334	that  there are just little patches that are mysterious. But in fact, we've just
   335	constructed around us  a  small  set  of  things  that  we  underst  and.  Also,
   336	particular  environments  in  VR will never be terribly exciting because they're
   337	so readily available. That ornate silver drum over there is an  unusual  object,
   338	which  gives  it  a  certain preciousness. If we were in virtual reality and you
   339	saw one of those, it wouldn't mean a damned thing,  because  you  could  make  a
   340	hundred  of  them  as  easily as one. So particular forms become mundane. What's
   341	exciting are the frontiers of imagination, the waves  of  creativity  as  people
   342	make up new things.
   343	
   344	Omni: How is it possible to build a virtual world?
   345	
   346	Lanier:  There's no one answer; anything's possible. We're working on technology
   347	that will grab a part of the physical world - an architect's rendering or  brain
   348	scan  - and translated that into the virtual world. Ultimately, though, the most
   349	efficient way w ill be to  use  virtual  tools  you  find  on  the  inside.  For
   350	instance,  if  you saw a big block of stone in a virtual reality, you might also
   351	see a chisel that you could pick up with your virtual  hand  and  start  carving
   352	with.  The  difference  is  that virtual tools will have super powers. You might
   353	make an eyedropper that could touch an object and squeeze it  in,  then  squeeze
   354	it  out  somewhere  else  to make copies of the original. You might have another
   355	tool that stretched anything it came across and made it long. Some  tools  could
   356	be  very expressive. This room is filled with musical instruments because I find
   357	them to be the most eloquent tools ever made. I want to make tools for  VR  that
   358	are  like  musical  instruments. You could pick them up and gracefully "play" re
   359	ality. You might "blow" a distant mountain range with  an  imaginary  saxophone.
   360	You'd  be  using gestures instead of building something stone by stone. When you
   361	can improvise while inside it, making it up as fast as you think and  feel,  you
   362	can  reach  other  people.  As  a  babies,  each of us has an astonishing liquid
   363	infinity of imagination on the inside, that butts up against the  stark  reality
   364	of  the physi cal world, which resists us. That the baby's imagination cannot be
   365	realized is a fundamental indignity that we only learn  to  live  with  when  we
   366	decide  to  call  ourselves  adults.  With virtual reality you have a world with
   367	many of the qualities of the physica l world,  but  it  doesn't  resist  us.  It
   368	releases  us  from  the  taboo against infinite possibilities. That's the reason
   369	virtual reality electrifies people so much. In the future I see it as  a  medium
   370	of  communications  where  people  improvise  worlds instead of words, making up
   371	dreams  to  share.  An  ideal  VR  conversation  would  have   the   continuity,
   372	spontaneity, expressiveness of a jazz jam but the literal content that's missing
   373	from  music. Things being made would be objects - houses, chemical processes, or
   374	whatever the conversation is about. It  would  be  a  reality  conversation,  an
   375	objective  form of the Jungian dream, the collective unconscious. You might call
   376	it the colle ctive conscious.
   377	
   378	Omni: What about virtual sex? Is it a possibility or not?
   379	
   380	Lanier: Oh, God [glumly].... I suppose virtual reality can contain any  kind  of
   381	imagery,  so  why  not  sexual?  But the whole subject of virtual sex forces the
   382	question. What is sexy? What is intimacy? There are  some  interesting  ways  to
   383	have  intimacy  in  virtua  l reality. Consider trading eyes. You'd hook up your
   384	virtual eyes to look out of another's head and vice versa, so that  you  control
   385	each  other's point of view. It's hard at first, and you really have to learn to
   386	dance together at a very intimate level to  make  it  work.  If  ind  that  more
   387	interesting than the idea of virtual sex, which seems a little funny to me.
   388	
   389	Omni:  When  it  reaches  the  mass  market,  might  people  settle  for touring
   390	mass-market worlds?
   391	
   392	Lanier: Once you get a taste for making up your own reality,  you  don't  go  in
   393	for  passive  realities anymore. I'm not saying that everyone will make up stuff
   394	all the time; there will be catalogs of old stuff. But I'll bet you a  pizza  in
   395	thirty  years  that  pe ople turn out to be creative. We're living in one of the
   396	strangest periods that has been  or  will  be.  In  the  twentieth  century  our
   397	society  has  been  completely warped by technology, but the technology is still
   398	astonishingly primitive. Considering that  kids  grow  up  with  TV,  a  one-way
   399	medium,  there's  a  tendency toward noninteractivity. This is the first century
   400	when technology has been the primary mode of people reaching each  other.  After
   401	this, it will be interactive technology.
   402	
   403	Omni: Who first made VR work?
   404	
   405	Lanier:  A  lot  of  people. Ivan Sutherland [a computer graphics pioneer] built
   406	head-mounted display with interactive graphics back in 1968. In  the  Seventies,
   407	Tom  Furness,  who was working for the U. S. Air Force, made enormous strides in
   408	the technology. My r ole has focused on turning this into a shared medium.  That
   409	had  never  been  done  before.  Until  then,  there'd  be  one  person inside a
   410	simulation just looking around in it. I also figured for  the  first  time.  Tom
   411	Zimmerman,  who  was  VPL's first hardware engineer in the early Eighties, built
   412	the first glove, and I integrated that  into  a  way  of  picking  up  imaginary
   413	objects  in  space. Tom's original idea was to use the glove to play air guitar.
   414	You could play music with a guitar  that  doesn't  exist.  I've  made  a  few  e
   415	laborate  versions  of  this  glove  including one last year where I played Jimi
   416	Hendrix solos.
   417	
   418	Omni: A Wall Street Journal headline said virtual reality was "electronic LSD."
   419	
   420	Lanier: That's stupid. The idea of spacing out in  virtual  reality  is  absurd.
   421	It  would be like getting a model train in order to fall asleep over it. VR is a
   422	medium; it affects the world outside your sense organs and that's  all.  It  has
   423	nothing  to  do  with  brain  chemistry  or  your state of being. If one becomes
   424	euphoric in virtual reality, it would  be  because  you  were  reacting  to  the
   425	outside  world  that  way.  The  first moment of freedom is always ecstatic, but
   426	after that you're on your own. Actually I'm  unqual  ified  to  talk  about  the
   427	subject  because  I've  never  taken  LSD.  I don't take drugs and I don't drink
   428	alcohol.
   429	
   430	Omni: Why do you wear dreadlocks?
   431	
   432	Lanier: I think of myself as a student who experiments with different things  at
   433	different  times.  I had much more conventional hair two years ago, and I'm sure
   434	I will again in two years. I had no intention of becoming  a  well-known  person
   435	this  year.  One  nic e thing about my hair is that if I ever want to get out of
   436	the hassles of being well-known, all I have to do is cut it off.  I  can  always
   437	save it as a wig and put it back on when I give talks.
   438	
   439	Omni: You're a high-school dropout?
   440	
   441	Lanier:  Escapee  is  more  like it. I left it ar fifteen and then kind of snuck
   442	into college - New Mexico State and other  places.  I  was  never  much  on  the
   443	rituals  of By rituals I mean turning in papers and finishing degrees.  Computer
   444	science is a splendid fi eld and most of the founders are still alive. I learned
   445	by apprenticing myself to some of them. Marvin Minsky  was  extremely  important
   446	to  me,  and  I used to just hang out with him. He is rethinking the whole world
   447	from the bottom up all the time. That's an inspiring quality.
   448	
   449	Omni: Did you invent make-believe worlds as a child?
   450	
   451	Lanier: What I  remember  most  about  my  childhood  isn't  so  much  inventing
   452	make-believe  worlds  as  being  overwhelmed  by  the  experience  of  different
   453	physical places. My sensitivity to the mood of a particular room  was  sometimes
   454	so intense I could hardly talk. I didn't know how to communicate that feeling to
   455	others.  I  love  words  - I love to read, write, talk - but I think words leave
   456	out almost everything. That frustration more than anything else -  feeling  that
   457	what  we  can  share  with  other  people  is so much mor e limited than what we
   458	actually experience - is what has driven me into this  technology.  Sometimes  I
   459	think  we've  uncovered  a  new  planet, but one that we're inventing instead of
   460	discovering. We're just starting to sight the shore of one  of  its  continents.
   461	Virtual reality is an adventure worth centuries.
