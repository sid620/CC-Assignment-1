     1	Boston, February 11, 1992 -- Evergreen Systems, makers of the FlexCom
     2	communication server for Novell LANs, is introducing a new line of
     3	products that offer dial-in, dial-out and other services for Novell and
     4	other leading local area networks. The company is unveiling its new
     5	CAPcard and CAPserver line at NETWORLD, Feb. 11 - 13, 1992 in Boston,
     6	booth #1416.
     7	
     8	Evergreen developed the product line in response to customer demand for a
     9	remote access; multi-function server with high performance; compatibility
    10	with all DOS and Windows applications; support for multiple LAN protocols
    11	and network operating systems; remote management and simplified
    12	installation. 
    13	
    14	                        CAPcard
    15	
    16	The CAPcard (Communication/Application Processor card) is a self-contained,
    17	network "PC-on-a-card" that features a 25 Mhz 386SX CPU, 2-16 MB of RAM,
    18	VGA video, two high-speed serial ports, parallel port, floppy and IDE disk
    19	interfaces and an NE2000-compatible Ethernet controller with both 10BaseT
    20	and thin coax cable connections. The standard product is bundled with
    21	management and communications software including MS-DOS 5.0 and Norton
    22	pcANYWHERE, allowing the CAPcard to be used for dial-in and dial-out
    23	operations with both MS-DOS and MS Windows applications.
    24	
    25	The CAPcard uses a direct connection to the network (no bridge or router is
    26	required). Therefore, it operates at full LAN speeds for file access, and
    27	can support multiple protocols including IPX, TCP/IP, NetBIOS, OSI and
    28	others. The card supports serial communications at speeds up to 57,600 bps
    29	for remote access with today's fastest modems and digital connections.
    30	
    31	The CAPcard also features CAPwatch, an on-board microcontroller that
    32	functions as a "smart" management processor with a number of duties. For
    33	example, CAPwatch will automatically reset the 386SX CPU if it should hang
    34	for any reason, an important requirement in LAN dial-in and other
    35	unattended applications. As this function is firmware-driven, it will work
    36	with both dial-up and digital type connections. In dial-up use, CAPwatch
    37	takes the telephone line "off hook" when the card is unavailable for a
    38	dial-in call, facilitating telephone line "hunt group" operation.
    39	
    40	For Ethernet LANs requiring only a few dial-in/dial-out lines, the CAPcard
    41	can be installed in any ISA/EISA bus computer, in which case it operates
    42	"passively", drawing only DC power from the AT bus. Modem and Ethernet
    43	connections (lOBaseT or coax) attach to the rear of the board (a VGA
    44	monitor and keyboard can also be attached).
    45	
    46	Priced at $1,995 with 2 MB RAM CAPcard includes dial-in, dial-out,
    47	management and MS-DOS 5.0 software. The CAPcard will be available in
    48	April. An OEM/integrator version of the CAPcard will also be available for
    49	database, file and print server applications (contact the factory for
    50	details).
    51	
    52	                     CAPserver
    53	
    54	For larger installations, up to 18 CAPcards can be installed in the
    55	Evergreen CAPserver (Communication/Application Processor server) base
    56	unit, which can be factory-configured as a turnkey system. The CAPserver
    57	also supports 4 and 16 Mbit Token Ring LANs by allowing each CAPcard to
    58	drive its own Token-Ring NIC. The unit is available in both desktop tower
    59	and rack-mount configurations and can accommodate local disk drives for
    60	the CAPcards, if required.
    61	
    62	The CAPcard/CAPserver architecture allows a user to start with a few
    63	"standalone" cards installed in a PC or fileserver, and then move up to
    64	the full CAPserver architecture, with its additional features, without
    65	sacrificing the original hardware investment.
    66	
    67	The CAPlink interprocessor communications channel, which is part of the
    68	CAPserver system, ties the CAPcards together to the system controller for
    69	management, boot-loading and other applications that are currently in
    70	development. Multiple CAPservers can be connected together for management
    71	purposes via CAPlink.
    72	
    73	Options for the CAPserver include the NPCC async card for dedicated
    74	dial-out or local host connection, and an X.25 interface for inbound and
    75	outbound connections. The CAPserver can also accommodate a wide variety of
    76	third-party, AT-bus cards including FAX servers, mainframe gateways and
    77	LAN-to-LAN routers.
    78	
    79	The CAPserver system includes a number of software features including a
    80	complete remote management facility; an enhanced, DES-based security
    81	system; audit trail logging; and a boot loader for the CAPcards. A network
    82	license for the Norton pcANYWHERE/LAN (Symantec Corporation)
    83	communications software is also included.
    84	
    85	Priced starting at $3,495, the CAPserver will be available in April for
    86	Novell-based LANs, with versions for Banyan, MS LAN Manager, OS/2 LAN
    87	Server and other networks to follow by Q3, 1992.
    88	
    89	Evergreen Systems is a leading supplier of products for remote access and
    90	async communications on Novell and other leading LANs. The company
    91	develops, manufacturers and distributes communications solutions that
    92	consist of proprietary software and hardware that feature flexibility,
    93	compatibility, security and remote management. Based in Novato,
    94	California, Evergreen was founded in 1989.
