     1	Santa Monica, CA, February 5, 1992 -- Retix, a leading worldwide supplier
     2	of Open Networking products, today expanded its OpenServer 400 series of
     3	X.400 based messaging solutions with a new version of OpenServer 400 and
     4	two additional gateway Products. The company has added an OS/2 version to
     5	its current line of popular OpenServer 400 products which includes
     6	versions for DOS and UNIX (both SCO and Interactive versions). In
     7	addition, Retix has introduced a new Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
     8	Gateway to X400 and a new version of the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer
     9	Protocol) Gateway to X.400, expanding its current suite of gateway
    10	products. Now, users in each of the major operating system environments,
    11	using virtually any e-mail system, can benefit from OpenServer 400's
    12	messaging solution.
    13	
    14	The OpenServer 400 Product Family
    15	
    16	Retix OpenServer 400 products allow users to link otherwise incompatible
    17	mail systems to one another, creating a cohesive, enterprise-wide
    18	messaging environment. All OpenServer 400 products provide a distributed
    19	solution based on widely-accepted industry and ISO international
    20	standards. In addition, OpenServer 400 products can be combined with an
    21	extensive suite of gateways from Retix and other vendors to gain access to
    22	virtually every popular e-mail and mail-enabled application in use today.
    23	OpenServer 400 for OS/2
    24	
    25	OpenServer 400 for OS/2 is designed to take full advantage of the
    26	multi-tasking OS/2 Version 1.3 operating system, providing users with
    27	improved performance and increased capacity for their enterprise-wide
    28	messaging networks. Key benefits of the OS/2 version include: better
    29	memory utilization and increased performance for more efficient service to
    30	large numbers of users; the ability to run OpenServer 400 and selected
    31	e-mail server applications on a single machine; and a graphical OpenServer
    32	Configuration Utility (OCU) running under Presentation Manager that
    33	simplifies configuration and set-up.
    34	
    35	"Now that we have a version of OpenServer 400 for OS/2, as well as DOS and
    36	UNIX, we can address the full spectrum of users that need to establish
    37	enterprise-wide messaging," said Mark Fishburn, vice president and general
    38	manager of Retix' OSI Product Unit.
    39	
    40	New Gateway Products
    41	
    42	Retix also expanded its family of gateways which work in conjunction with
    43	OpenServer 400 to give users of PC LAN-based e-mail systems
    44	interoperability with a wide range of other e-mail systems, mainframe and
    45	minicomputer based systems and public mail networks that support X.400.
    46	
    47	The new Microsoft (MS) Mail for PC Networks Gateway provides MS
    48	Mail-to-X.400 format conversion and transmission, allowing users of MS
    49	Mail for PC Networks (formerly Consumer Software's Network Courier e-mail
    50	package) to send messages and receive messages from users of other e-mail
    51	systems. In fact, to the MS Mail user, users of other email systems appear
    52	as if they were using the same mail system; the gateway simply maps the MS
    53	Mail address to the X.400 address transparently.
    54	
    55	The Retix SMTP Gateway to X.400 works in a similar fashion, providing
    56	SMTP-to-X.400 format conversion and transmission facilities, so that users
    57	of UNIX e-mail systems (RFC 822 mailers) obtain access to other e-mail
    58	systems and mail networks. Using the SMTP Gateway in combination with
    59	OpenServer 400, users can send messages or files throughout an enterprise
    60	using any e-mail package that supports RFC 822. The new version of the
    61	gateway announced today adds support for SCO UNIX (to the previously
    62	supported Interactive version), as well as MMDF-II, a popular SCO UNIX
    63	mailer.
    64	
    65	"Microsoft has a significant market share in the LAN-based e-mail world
    66	with MS Mail for PC Networks, and UNIX mailers are used heavily in both
    67	government and academic sectors," said James Neiser, associate vice
    68	president of marketing for the Retix OSI Product Unit. "In conjunction
    69	with our OpenServer Partners, we can now provide X.400-based
    70	interoperability to e-mail users in virtually every market sector."
    71	
    72	The MS Mail for PC Networks and SMTP Gateways to X.400 join the growing
    73	number of gateways supplied by Retix and its OpenServer Partners to
    74	provide access to popular e-mail and mail-enabled applications. Additional
    75	gateways to X.400 are currently available for users of 3Com, cc:Mail,
    76	NetWare MHS, OfficeWorks, MS Mail for Macintosh and WordPerfect, among
    77	others.
    78	
    79	Pricing and Availability
    80	
    81	OpenServer for OS/2 is available 60 days ARO and begins at $5,950, U.S.
    82	list. The Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Gateway to X.400 and the new
    83	version of the SMTP Gateway to X.400 are available 60 days ARO. Pricing
    84	for both gateways begins at $1,795, U.S. list. The products will be
    85	demonstrated, along with OpenServer 400, at Networld Boston, February
    86	11-13,1992 in Boston, Massachusetts, booth 121.
