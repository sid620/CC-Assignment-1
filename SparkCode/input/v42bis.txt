     7	High speed modems have 4800 bps or faster data transfer rates. Until
     8	recently most high speed modems used proprietary modulation schemes. In
     9	other words, one manufacturers' modem would not connect to another
    10	manufacturers' modem. Standards exist now that allow the interconnection
    11	of different manufacturers modems.
    12	
    13	MODULATION STANDARDS
    14	
    15	In the mid 1980's the International Consultative Committee on Telephone
    16	and Telegraph (CCITT in French) established the V.32 standard. The V.32
    17	standard describes how modems should "talk" to each other using two-way
    18	signaling at 4,800 and 9,600 bps over dial-up telephone lines.
    19	
    20	Unfortunately the V.32 standard did not provide a method for error
    21	control. Since V.32 signaling is more sensitive to noise and echoes on
    22	the telephone line than lower-speed protocols are, you need an error
    23	control scheme to retain accuracy.
    24	
    25	In early 1991, the CCITT issued the V.32bis standard. The V.32bis
    26	standard adds 7,200, 12,000, and 14,400 bps transfer rates and a faster
    27	renegotiation protocol to the V.32 standard.
    28	
    29	It is important to understand that the V.32 standard primarily describes
    30	the electrical signaling scheme used over the telephone wire. Other
    31	standards, such as MNP, V.42, and V.42bis, describe actions taking place
    32	above the level of electrical signaling. So you can have modems using
    33	different combinations of signaling and error correction protocols.
    34	
    35	ERROR CONTROL STANDARDS
    36	
    37	Microcom developed its own standard for asynchronous data error control,
    38	Microcom Network Protocol (MNP). MNP Class 4 is the most commonly used
    39	version of this family of error control. The error checking operates
    40	independently of the signaling scheme used by the modem.
    41	
    42	In 1988, the CCITT issued a hardware-implemented asynchronous error
    43	correction standard called V.42, which describes two error correction
    44	schemes. The primary protocol is Link Access Procedure for Modems (LAPM).
    45	The secondary protocol is functionally equivalent to MNP Class 4. The
    46	LAPM method offers slightly better error recovery and reliability than
    47	MNP Class 4.
    48	
    49	While the V.42 and MNP Class 4 protocols help maintain reliability, they
    50	do little to improve throughput. Both protocols convert asynchronous data
    51	characters to a synchronous data stream, making it a bit oriented
    52	protocol instead of character oriented. Most asynchronous characters
    53	consist of one start bit, eight data bits, and one stop bit, for a total
    54	of ten bits per character. V.42 removes the start and stop "framing"
    55	bits, which results in a 20% increase in efficiency. However, in order
    56	for the protocol to work, V.42 adds about 12% in overhead back into the
    57	transmission. The resulting 8% cushion helps maintain full transfer speed
    58	during periods of moderate error correction activity (usually caused by
    59	noisy telephone lines.)
    60	For all practical purposes, the result of the V.42 link is an error free
    61	transmission. Using the 16 bit redundancy check, it will detect every
    62	error that is 16 bits or smaller, with 100% probability. As a result, the
    63	chances of an error occurring are so small that you can, in practice,
    64	ignore them.
    65	
    66	DATA COMPRESSION STANDARDS
    67	
    68	The next step in increasing throughput involves data compression. Data
    69	compression can be used to provide a modem with an effective data
    70	throughput rate that is higher than the modem's bps transmission speed.
    71	The amount of this increase in throughput will depend largely on the type
    72	of data being transferred.
    73	
    74	Microcom introduced the MNP Class 5 data compression protocol. Software
    75	supporting the MNP Class 5 protocol offers the ability to compress files
    76	to half their original size during transmission, thus providing a 100%
    77	increase in speed. However, 80-85% increases in speed are more typical.
    78	MNP Class 5 requires concurrent error correction using MNP Class 4.
    79	
    80	In late 1989, the CCITT issued the V.42bis standard, describing how to
    81	implement data compression in hardware. V.42bis uses the Lempel-Ziv
    82	compression algorithm and offers a 35% greater data compression than MNP
    83	Class 5. For 9600 bps modems this means a potential throughput of 38,400
    84	bps. For most file transfers, however, a throughput of 19,200 bps on non-
    85	compressed files can be expected.
    86	
    87	The V.42bis standard adapts to the data flow more quickly than MNP Class
    88	5, turning data compression on and off as required. This gives it an
    89	advantage over MNP Class 5 when transmitting previously compressed files,
    90	since the MNP Class 5 compression algorithm can cause compressed files to
    91	expand, reducing throughput. V.42bis simply passes pre-compressed data
    92	through without trying to compress it. V.42bis compression software only
    93	works with hardware that uses the V.42 error correction protocol.
    94	
    95	DATA TRANSFER
    96	
    97	When using a file transfer protocol to send and receive data, the type of
    98	protocol used will have a big effect on the speed gain due to
    99	compression. In general, a protocol that uses long data blocks (the
   100	longer the better) will transfer files quicker. To take full advantage of
   101	MNP or V.42 error correction, you should select the software's no-error-
   102	correction option.
   103	
   104	To make use of the data compression, the modems need to be driven at full
   105	capacity. In other words, the data needs to be present at enough volume
   106	(file transfers and batch operations) and speed to get maximum
   107	compression benefits. For a V.32bis connection with V.42bis compression
   108	the serial ports should be set for 38,400 bps.
   109	
   110	In order for data compression to take place, both the answer and
   111	originate modems at each end of the telephone line must have compression
   112	and error correction enabled. If one unit does not have data compression
   113	enabled, only error correction takes place.
   114	
   115	Overall, on-the-fly compression with V.42bis on a V.32bis connection is
   116	the most desirable and economical mode of operation for most
   117	applications.
   118	
   119	COMPUSERVE
   120	
   121	At the present time all of CompuServe's 9600 bps modems are US Robotics
   122	Dual Standard modems. These modems support the V.32 modulation standard,
   123	the V.42 error correction protocol, and V.42bis & MNP level 5 compression
   124	protocols. The US Robotics Dual Standard is also upgradeable to V.32bis
   125	modulation.
   126	
   127	CompuServe sets the modems to V.32 mode, and leaves both the MNP level 5
   128	and V.42bis data compression enabled. But, even when using compression,
   129	nothing is gained during normal operation because the ports are locked at
   130	9600 bps. If an error occurs during transmission the re-transmitted
   131	frames will be compressed. The result is that the throughput will remain
   132	close to the maximum port speed even with some phone line noise or other
   133	interference.
   134	
   135	CompuServe's Host-Micro Interface (HMI), used by the CompuServe
   136	Information Manager (CIM) and other CompuServe software products, uses B+
   137	protocol full-time as the transport layer, and results in a measure of
   138	data compression due to "bit packing" of transmitted data into a smaller
   139	number of bits, using a technique similar to V.42. As with V.42, it
   140	primarily acts to maintain throughput at a high level by offsetting the
   141	protocol overhead, rather than increasing throughput significantly beyond
   142	that achieved at the same baud rate without compression or error
   143	detection.
   144	
   145	CIM and other HMI products enjoy continuous error detection and
   146	correction as a function of the B+ protocol transport layer, and this
   147	error correction, being integral to the HMI, cannot be disabled. As a
   148	result, the use of other error correction protocols such as MNP-4 or V.42
   149	"in series" with the software's own error correction may be, in many
   150	cases, redundant and unnecessary, and can actually slow down data
   151	transfer and/or interfere with flow control. For this reason, it is
   152	sometimes suggested that hardware error correction not be activated when
   153	using HMI products.
   154	
   155	CompuServe does not, at this time, permit data transfer rates at the port
   156	above 9600 baud. The reasons for this have mainly to do with the
   157	"backbone" of CompuServe's network, which handles the overall data
   158	traffic for many users simultaneously, and the need to manage the
   159	expansion of local nodes and the backbone itself in tandem.
   160	
   161	CompuServe's dial-up data network currently includes approximately 20,000
   162	"1200 bps equivalents," each representing the load on the network
   163	presented by a port operating at 1200 baud. Logically, a port operating
   164	at 9600 baud represents 8 "1200bEs" in terms of the demands placed upon
   165	the network. Currently, 9600 baud ports represent approximately 3% of the
   166	total number of ports, but account for as much as 15% of network load.
   167	
   168	During the current fiscal year, CompuServe plans to expand the number of
   169	9600 baud ports in the network by a full 200 percent. Overall, the impact
   170	on the CompuServe network "backbone" will be an increase in total data
   171	traffic by as much as 50 percent. Such an increase requires effective
   172	planning and more than a little control over how, when and where the
   173	expansion is performed.
   174	
   175	If CompuServe was to allow the use of data compression to increase the
   176	effective data rate at the port, and hence demand on the network, by a
   177	factor of as much as 4:1, the effective increase in network load as a
   178	result of expansion of the 9600 baud ports could easily jump to 200
   179	percent of the current load. Needless to say, that's not something that
   180	can be done with a "flip of a switch." The network "backbone" must be
   181	expanded in tandem with the addition of 9600 baud ports; there's much
   182	more involved than simply hooking up a 9600 baud modem at the port end.
   183	Hardware and software must be replaced, enhanced and reconfigured, and
   184	new facilities brought on-line on the host end to deal effectively with
   185	the increased amount of data coming into the computer centers.
   186	
   187	While the primary benefits of data compression are not available to
   188	CompuServe users now, they will be available in the not-distant future.
   189	For now, CompuServe's primary concern is to make sure that the expansion
   190	of the 9600 baud service does not negatively impact other users of the
   191	network, while providing maximum benefit from the expansion and the
   192	availability of basic 9600 baud service.
   193	
   194	ELECTRONIC BULLETIN BOARD SYSTEMS
   195	
   196	Electronic Bulletin Board System's (BBS's) have been around for a number
   197	of years now, and their numbers are growing on an almost daily basis. All
   198	major cities boast several BBS's, and many smaller cities have at least
   199	one BBS. Most BBS's limit each user's time on-line, so it is in your best
   200	interest to transfer as much data as possible while you are on-line.
   201	
   202	High speed modems can allow as much as 16 times the data transfer per
   203	unit of time over standard 2400 bps modems. US Robotics, and several
   204	other modem manufacturers, often provide high speed modems to established
   205	BBS system operators (SysOps) at or below cost. These promotions are
   206	usually in the best interest of the manufacturer. The SysOps become
   207	familiar with the product and recommend it to the users.
   208	
   209	If you are connecting to a BBS over long distance a high speed modem the
   210	savings on your phone bill can greatly offset the initial cost of high
   211	speed data transfer. The best way to save on telephone line charges is to
   212	use scripts or front end programs to automate your BBS activities. Many
   213	BBS's use a similar format for message and upload/download areas. As
   214	BBS's become more standardized perhaps better front end programs for the
   215	various BBS's will be written.
