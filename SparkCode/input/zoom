     8	Introduction
     9	
    10	This chapter describes the AT command set. If you're using
    11	communication software, you shouldn't have to use AT
    12	commands. Your modem will be controlled by your
    13	communications software. However, if you are writing software
    14	that you want to control the modem, or if you want to
    15	undderstand the "behind the scenes" operation of the modem,
    16	you'll want to learn more about the AT command set.
    17	Major topics discussed in this following section include:

    34	command Execution
    35	
    36	Your modem accepts only ASCII characters (loosely speaking
    37	the characters on the keyboard) as commands- The commands
    38	entered while the modem is in command mode are stored in a
    39	memory buffer that is 40 characters long. Unless the echo
    40	back is disabled (EO command), these characters will also be
    41	echoed back to your computer and displayed on the monitor
    42	screen. Upon seeing a carriage return showing that the
    43	command is ended, the command is compared to a list of valid
    44	commands, and if a match is found, the function associated
    45	with the command is executed.
    46	
    47	A command line must start with the ATtention code AT.
    48	However, commands may be strung together in a single command
    49	line. If desired, each command may be separated by a space
    50	for readability, however the command string may not exceed 40
    51	characters and spaces. The command or string of commands will
    52	be executed when you enter a carriage return, and a result
    53	code is sent back after the last command that is executed in
    54	the command string. The result codes are displayed on the
    55	monitor, unless they have been intentionally disabled.
    56	
    57	
    58	command Guidelines
    59	
    60	Your modem is easy to operate and configure. However, it is
    61	very important that certain guidelines for issuing commands
    62	to the modam are followed.
    63	
    64	If an error was made while entering a command in command
    65	mode, it can be edited at any time (before pressing the
    66	return key).Pressing the backspace key delete the last
    67	character entered. By pressing the backspace key repeatedly,
    68	the entire command line may be deleted, except for the AT
    69	command at the beginning of the command line.
    70	
    71	Each command line must end with carriage return. The modem
    72	does not begin command execution until it receives a carriage
    73	return.
    74	
    75	
    76	A missing parameter in a cammand that requires a parameter tp
    77	fully define the command (in addition to the command)
    78	evaluates to zero.
    79	
    80	The command buffer is 40 characters long, If a Command
    81	exceeds 40 characters, the modem will abort execution of the
    82	command line and display an error message.
    83	
    84	AT Immediate Commands
    85	The modem command set consists of two types of commands:
    86	Immediate Commands and set Commands. The Immediate Commands
    87	will always use the current default settings, unless the
    88	command specifies otherwise. The table below lists the
    89	Immediate commands and their functions.
    90	
    91	                  AT ImmediateCommands
    92	
    93	COMMAND                        FUNCTION
    94	
    95	AT   Command line prefix.  The Attention Command precedes
    96	     all other commands listed below except for A/ and the
    97	     excape code. For example, the command DT would be typed
    98	     ATDT.
    99	______________________________________________________________
   100	A/   Repeat the previous command (not to be preceded by AT)
   101	______________________________________________________________
   102	A    The modem is set to answer mode and goes offhook
   103	     immediately.
   104	______________________________________________________________
   105	
   106	Dn   Dial the number immediately following this command
   107	     where n is the number to be dialed, or that number
   108	     combined with other dial subcommands as shown below.
   109	     Any combination of the subcommands listed below may
   110	     be strung together to perform the desired dialing
   111	     sequance. The number is dialed in the call progress
   112	     or blind mode depending on register S11.
   113	
   114	     DIAL          FUNCTION
   115	     SUBCOMMAND
   116	
   117	     T             Touch Tone Dialing.
   118	
   119	     P             Pulse Dialing.
   120	                   (Default to Pulse if T or P not used)
   121	
   122	     R             Reverse mode. Puts modem in answer mode
   123	                   immediately after dialing.
   124	
   125	     W             Wait for a continuous tone before
   126	                   dialing the next number. Useful for dialing
   127	                   MCI or Sprint. The modem waits for the
   128	                   number of seconds set by the register S7
   129	                   for the tone to occur. If the tone is not
   130	                   not heard, BUSY or NO DIALTONE result code
   131	                   is issued.
   132	
   133	     @             Wait for the "quiet answer" - one or more
   134	                   rings followed by 5 seconds of silence -
   135	                   for the length of time defined by register S7.
   136	
   137	     ,             Pause the length of time specified by register
   138	                   S8 (default time = 2 seconds). Each comma
   139	                   equals the pause length specified.
   140	
   141	     !             Flash.  This character can be used to go
   142	                   temporarily on-hook in order to get a new
   143	                   dialtone. (Note: Some software uses ! as a
   144	                   carriage return.)
   145	
   146	
   147	     ;             Return to the Command state after
   148	                   dialing. This command can only be
   149	                   placed at the end of a dial command.
   150	
   151	     S             Dial a stored number. The numbers
   152	                   are stored in the registers of the
   153	                   microcontroller.
   154	
   155	   S=9             Dial stored number 0,1,2,or 3 that has
   156	                   been previously stored in non-volatile
   157	                   memory using &Zn command (the non-
   158	                   volatile memory is an optional feature).
   159	
   160	0-9  # * ABCD      Digits and -characters that may be use
   161	                   in dialing. il * and ABCO may only be
   162	                   used when tone dialing.

   165	
   166	                   This example instructs the modem to tone
   167	                   dial the number 1234567. Bl@nk spaces
   168	                   within a command string are ignored.
   169	
   170	DIAL EXAMPLE 2:  ATDP9WT4ll,,,,,HO
   171	
   172	                   This example instructs the modem to
   173	                   pulse dial 9, wait for a second
   174	                   dialtone; tone dial the number 411,
   175	                   pause 10 seconds, and then hang up.

   190	          n = 1, online with equalizer retrain sequence (2400
   191	          bps only).
   192	          Issuing an 'On' command always takes modem offhook
   193	
   194	    Z     Causes a software reset with registers set to default
   195	          values.
   196	
   197	    &F    Sets values for S Registers and commands to factory
   198	          default.
   199	
   200	    &Zn   Stores telephone numbers to optional non-volatile
   201	          memory. Modem normally comes without non-volatile

   320	         AT Commands for Optional Non-Volatile Memory
   321	
   322	This modem has been designed to accept non-volatile memory
   323	if required. In general, non-volatile memory is not required
   324	for modems that are used in PCs, since the configuration that
   325	would be stored in the non-volatile memory is stored instead
   326	in the communications software as part of the software setup,
   327	or as an initialization string or dial string.
   328	
   329	&V   Displays active configuration profiles (S Register
   330	     settings, commands, and telephone numbers. Inputs
   331	     from the DTE are ignored while this information is
   332	     being sent.
   333	
   334	@Wn  Store Active Profile. Sends and stores acceptable
   335	     values for certain commands and S Registers to non-
   336	     volatile RAM. The following may be stored:
   337	
   338	        Commands:Bn,Cn,En,Fn,Ln,Mn,P or T,Qn,Vn,Yn,Xn,&Cn,
   339	        &Dn,&Gn,&Jn,&Ln,&Mn,&Pn,&Qn,&Rn,&Sn,&T4,&T5,&Xn
   340	        Registers:S0,S14,S18,S21,S22,S23,S25,S26,S27
   341	     The last DTE speed and parity are also stored. Stored
   342	     values are used on power-up or hard reset.
   343	
   344	     n = 0, Store active profile in location 0
   345	     n = 1, Store active profile in location 1
   346	
   347	&Yn  Select Stored Profile on Power Up Option
   348	     n = 0, Select profile 0 on power up or hard reset
   349	     n = 1, Select profile 1 on power up or hard reset
   350	     See the &Wn command for particular commands and S
   351	     Registers stored. The selected &Y command survives a
   352	     power outage
   353	
   354	&Zn=x    Store Telephone Number. Stores up to four dialing
   355	         strings in non-volatile RAM for later recall using DS
   356	         (dial stored number) command.
   357
