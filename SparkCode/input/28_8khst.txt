     3	           U.S. ROBOTICS ANNOUNCES THE LAST MODEM YOU'LL EVER BUY
     4	        Provides Migration Path to Forthcoming CCITT 28.8 Kbps Standard
     5	        ---------------------------------------------------------------

     7	     SKOKIE, Ill. -- June 8, 1992 -- U.S. Robotics today announced an upgrade
     8	program for the CCITT-proposed standard of 28.8 Kbps, previously referred to
     9	as V.FAST.  The Courier V.32bis, Courier HST Dual Standard and Shared Access
    10	Modem Sharing Kits are the products currently included in the program. Field
    11	upgrades will be available for $299 as soon as the CCITT 28.8 Kbps draft
    12	recommendation is completed. Official approval of the standard is not
    13	expected until January, 1994.
    14	     "The CCITT-proposed 28.8 Kbps standard won't be a reality for most
    15	manufacturers until 1994," said Jonathan Zakin, U.S. Robotics executive vice
    16	president, sales and marketing.  "By offering modems ready for 28.8 Kbps now,
    17	we're providing insurance against technical obsolescence.  Customers can
    18	purchase a Courier high-speed modem or Shared Access Modem Sharing Kit now
    19	and take advantage of the most updated technology available. When the 28.8
    20	Kbps standard becomes available later, they'll already have a cost-effective
    21	upgrade option and won't have to re-invest in new equipment."
    22	     "Key to the 28.8 Kbps program is the fact that the upgrade to the
    23	Courier high-speed modems and Shared Access Modem Sharing Kits can be
    24	completed by the end user at their worksite, which reduces their `down' time
    25	and eliminates excess costs like shipping and handling," continued Zakin.
    26	"You may hear about other 28.8 Kbps modems that are available now, but until
    27	the standard is defined, no one knows what hardware will be needed to comply.
    28	Our unique modem architecture makes future `field' upgrades a realistic and
    29	simple procedure."
    30	     Because of U. S. Robotics' advanced modular modem architecture, the
    31	company's Courier V.32bis, Courier HST Dual Standard, and Shared Access modems
    32	are readily upgradable to 28.8Kbps. The modems are made up of a motherboard and
    33	a smaller daughterboard, which holds the modems' microprocessors and firmware.
    34	The current, high-speed daughterboard can easily be replaced with a new board
    35	containing the 28.8 Kbps CCITT standard.  U.S. Robotics is the only modem
    36	manufacturer to implement this kind of flexible design.
    37	     "In the CClTT, the previously called `V.FAST' standard has gained
    38	universal support at the 28.8Kbps speed," said Dale Walsh, U.S. Robotics vice
    39	president, advanced development and participant in the CCITT committee on the
    40	28.8 Kbps standard, "This is how our modular architecture works. The data
    41	pump (which executes the modulation and demodulation of the data), and the
    42	key controller functions (which perform the data compression, error control
    43	and the AT command set) are on one board, making upgrades simple. We can
    44	easily make the data pump faster and upgrade the controller functions to keep
    45	up with the new speed. It's all in just one small plug-in card."
    46	     Because compatibility with CCITT standards is crucial, U.S. Robotics'
    47	availability and implementation of the 28.8Kbps standard will depend on the
    48	CClTT's progress.  At this time, the standard is expected to define a connect
    49	speed of 28.8 Kbps, two times faster than V.32bis, the fastest CCITT
    50	standard now available.
    51	     U.S. Robotics is one of the first vendors to announce a program for
    52	28.8Kbps compatibility.  The company has a history of industry "firsts,"
    53	including the first CCITT V.32bis modem from a major manufacturer, the first
    54	self-managing modem management system and the first portable CCITT V.32
    55	modem.
    56	     U.S. Robotics will upgrade any Modem Sharing Kit to 28.8Kbps. Current
    57	Courier models, which have the smaller footprint and a higher, 57.6 Kbps DCE
    58	to DTE (modem-to-computer) interface speed, are also upgradable. The
    59	company's upgrade program does not include WorldPort and Sportster modems.
    60	     U. S. Robotics Courier modems offer a wide range of features, including
    61	fax, remote configuration, and synchronous capabilities. The Shared Access
    62	Modem Sharing Kits, which began shipping in March, 1992, allow for the
    63	pooling of modems on a LAN so that a LAN user can access them for dial-in or
    64	dial-out communications.
    65	     The following products will be upgradable to 28.8 Kbps:
    66	
    67	  Courier V.32 bis, internal and external          (57,600 bps versions only)
    68	  Courier HST Dual Standard, internal and external (57,600 bps versions only)
    69	  Courier V.32 bis FAX, internal and external
    70	  Courier HST Dual Standard FAX, internal and external
    71	  Shared Access Modem Sharing Kit Single Port and Dual Port
    72	
    73	                 THE CCITT 28.8 KBPS STANDARD: SOME BACKGROUND
    74	                 ---------------------------------------------
    75	
    76	     The standard for 28.8 Kbps dial-up communications being developed by the
    77	CCITT will stretch the limits of dial-up telephone lines.  But don't expect
    78	to be sending files at top speeds immediately.
    79	     Dale Walsh,  vice president for advanced development at U.S. Robotics,
    80	Inc., cautions that most users won't be able to achieve the maximum speeds
    81	permitted under the standard right away. When the standard is adopted, modems
    82	that conform should be able to transmit at 19.2 Kbps on lines where a modem
    83	conforming to V.32bis (the current high-speed standard) can now transmit at
    84	14.4 Kbs.  But Walsh,  a member of the CCITT committee developing the
    85	standard, says it is being formulated with the increasing digitization of 
    86	dial-up phone networks in mind.
    87	     The improved quality of phone lines, as much as any modem technology
    88	improvements, has made high speed dial-up communications possible" says
    89	Walsh. "We are designing the standard keeping in mind that phone networks
    90	will use more and more digital circuits and digital central office switches."
    91	     Consequently, speeds in the neighborhood of 28.8 Kbps will be the
    92	exception, rather than the rule--at least until the public switched
    93	telephone network becomes completely digital.
    94	     "I'd say when it's finished in a year or so, the standard will allow
    95	19.2 Kbps transmissions on 80 percent of all lines, 24 Kbps on 50 percent of
    96	all lines, and 28.8 Kbps communications on 20 percent of all lines," says
    97	Walsh, who also helped develop the CCITT V.32bis standard for 14.4 Kbps
    98	dial-up communications.  "As the phone networks improve, top speeds will be
    99	more easily achieved, so I think it's more realistic to think of it as a
   100	19.2 Kbps standard that is sometimes capable of higher speeds.
   101	     A common misconception is that the coming 28.8 Kbps standard will allow
   102	speeds of 115.2 Kbps, when combined with V.42bis data compression.  Walsh noted
   103	that such calculations are based on an assumption that V.42bis allows 4 to 1
   104	data compression.  Outside the lab, V.42bis allows compression ratios between
   105	2 to 1 and 3 to 1, meaning that under REAL LIFE conditions, the forthcoming
   106	standard will allow maximum throughput of about 86.4 Kbps.
   107	     "It's a mistake to use the 28.8 number and max everything out from that,"
   108	said Walsh.
   109	     Not that the 28.8 Kbps standard doesn't have its advantages.  After all,
   110	19.2 Kbps is an improvement over 14.4 Kbps.  And the forthcoming standard will
   111	adjust for line conditions, a critical factor in high-speed data
   112	communications--like no previous standard.  The standard under development
   113	will include a "probing" function that the modem can use to "sound out" the
   114	quality of the phone line.  That will allow the modem to optimize transmissions
   115	to take advantage of available bandwidth.
   116	     "We are still working on the training sequences," says Walsh.  "But before
   117	transmission starts, the standard will enable the modem to determine what band-
   118	width is available and how to best position the signal to match available band-
   119	width."
   120	     The standard achieves higher speeds through its ability to use more of a
   121	line's bandwidth, not just the center portion of the channel used under current
   122	standards.
   123	     "It will more closely match the modulation scheme to what's available," 
   124	says Walsh.  "That way, the modem can shape the transmissions to adapt 
   125	precisely to the channel, which is very important if you want to transmit at
   126	high speeds.
   127	     The most recent committee meeting was held last month.  Still to be 
   128	agreed upon are such critical issues as training sequences, coding schemes, and
   129	signaling rates.  Walsh said he expects the committee to reach final agreement
   130	in 1993, with official CCITT adoption likely in 1994.
   131	     While some have taken to calling the standard under development V.Last,
   132	Walsh isn't convinced this will be the final modem standard.  After all, he
   133	notes, no one thought dial-up phone lines would ever be this noise-free, and
   134	further advances in that area could make even higher speed dial-up
   135	communication possible.
   136	     "I'm certain we'll have at least a fax version of this standard as the
   137	quality of phone lines keep improving," he said.  "We're trying to be sure that
   138	this standard will serve users into the year 2000.  But modem standards are
   139	like wars: you always think it's going to be the last one."
