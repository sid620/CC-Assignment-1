    13	     High-tech security techniques, which may become commonplace
    14	in the next century, are being tested in the French resort city
    15	of Biarritz.  The visiophone, a device that transmits both audio
    16	and visual images across fiber optic lines, is being used by the
    17	Biarritz Police Department to augment traditional policing
    18	techniques.  The device provides personnel in the police station
    19	the opportunity to access visually the interiors of offices,
    20	stores, nursing homes, and some residences in the city.  While
    21	this pilot program began small, it has grown to include over
    22	1,500 units and has changed policing methods and public
    23	perception about police effectiveness.
    24	
    25	BIARRITZ AND THE VISIOPHONE
    26	
    27	      Biarritz, once a renowned resort destination for American
    28	and European vacationers, had fallen on hard economic times
    29	after its popularity was eclipsed by other resort areas on the
    30	Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts.  However, when French
    31	Telecom, the French telephone company, began to search for a
    32	suitable site for its visiophone pilot program, Biarritz met the
    33	requirements and was chosen due to several important factors:
    34	
    35	     *  The experiment was to take place in a medium-sized city;
    36	        the population of Biarritz, though it swells to 100,000
    37	        in the summer, remains at about 30,000 during the
    38	        remainder of the year.
    39	
    40	     *  The city's old telephone network needed refurbishing.         
    41	
    42	     *  The city's geographical location and population, largely
    43	        made up of retirees, was well-suited for the visiophone
    44	        experiment.
    45	
    46	     The visiophone itself is a compact device, measuring 47cm
    47	(18") wide, 42cm (16") deep, and 30cm (11") high.  It includes a
    48	17cm (3") square screen, a detachable camera on the right side,
    49	a telephonic module, a full keyboard (with numbers and letters),
    50	and a voice amplifier.  The instrument, which has the ability to
    51	access Minitel (the Telecom computer), produces either
    52	black-and-white or color images, depending on the type of camera
    53	used.
    54	
    55	     For this program, installation of the visiophone is free,
    56	with monthly costs averaging $14.50.  Visiophonic calls are
    57	billed at the same rate as regular telephone communications.
    58	
    59	     The initial network of 50 subscribers in 1985 has steadily
    60	grown.  While security was not the motivation for the
    61	development of this pilot program, it quickly became obvious to
    62	the local police that the system offered potentially valuable
    63	applications in the realm of enhanced security, especially for
    64	the large population of elderly citizens in Biarritz.
    65	
    66	POLICE USE OF THE VISIOPHONE
    67	
    68	Telesurveillance
    69	
    70	     A number of banks and businesses throughout the city have
    71	alarm systems that are connected to police headquarters.  These
    72	alarms are activated accidentally several times a day, resulting
    73	in wasted time and effort by the police.  But now, when an alarm
    74	sounds, it is possible to conduct an initial investigation of
    75	the establishment using the visiophone.
    76	
    77	     In a usual case, the watch officer contacts the business by
    78	visiophone once an alarm sounds, and requests that a visual scan
    79	of the interior be conducted using the detachable camera.  All
    80	doubt can be resolved without an officer leaving the precinct.
    81	However, if doubt remains--no answer to the visiophone, poor
    82	vision through the camera, or suspicious activity observed in
    83	the premises--a patrol is dispatched immediately.  The patrol
    84	then knows that this may not be a routine call and will
    85	naturally exercise more caution.
    86	
    87	Visiophonic Patrolling
    88	
    89	     As mentioned earlier, the population of Biarritz includes a
    90	significant number of elderly persons.  The majority of these
    91	retirees have worked elsewhere and now find themselves isolated
    92	from their families.  Many have developed a sense of insecurity
    93	fueled by accounts of rising crime rates.
    94	
    95	     It is the responsibility of the police, to some degree, to
    96	ease their feelings of insecurity.  To this end, a plan was
    97	developed, in late 1988, to integrate the visiophone with the
    98	traditional patrol function.
    99	
   100	     This plan involves 500 subscribers and impacts
   101	approximately 1,000 residents of the community.  The initial
   102	effort required beat officers to contact residents over the age
   103	of 65 personally and provide them with a written explanation
   104	describing the program.  These residents were then informed that
   105	if they desired, the police would contact them about twice a
   106	month by visiophone.
   107	
   108	     Visiophonic patrolling is not intended to replace the
   109	traditional patrol function.  Instead, it is meant to supplement
   110	it.  The visiophone allows the police, in a sense, to enter the
   111	door of the elderly and reassure them concerning their security.
   112	Because many of the elderly reside in high-rise apartment
   113	buildings, the opportunity for door-to-door personal contact by
   114	the police is significantly reduced.  The visiophone provides a
   115	more-intimate level of contact than ever before possible in
   116	these situations.
   117	
   118	Answering the Call
   119	
   120	     The visiophone is, of course, a two-way system, allowing a
   121	citizen with the device to call the police and be greeted by the
   122	reassuring image of an officer on the screen.  When an emergency
   123	call is placed, the watch officer can view the interior of the
   124	premises and maintain audiovisual contact with the caller while
   125	the patrol is making its way to the scene.  This has proven
   126	particularly reassuring, especially to elderly residents who
   127	become very anxious when facing a potentially dangerous
   128	situation feeling isolated and alone.
   129	
   130	RESULTS
   131	
   132	     Early reaction to the police use of the visiophone has been
   133	very positive.  Residents and businesses have expressed
   134	appreciation and a new level of regard for the police since
   135	visiophonic patrolling and telesurveillance have been
   136	instituted.  Factors contributing to the success of the
   137	visiophone program were studied by the National Center of
   138	Telecommunication Studies (France).  The NCTS drew these
   139	conclusions:
   140	
   141	     *  90% of the elderly persons surveyed are very satisfied
   142	        with the type of police contact made available by the
   143	        visiophone.
   144	
   145	     *  The visiophone provides a much more efficient means of 
   146	        communication than the telephone, since during a typical
   147	        conversation, as much as 40% of the message is
   148	        communicated by gestures and countenance.  The
   149	        visiophone permits the communication of the visual
   150	        signals that the telephone misses.
   151	
   152	     *  Because communication via the visiophone is interactive,
   153	        rather than passive, more information is retained by the
   154	        citizen during a conversation.
   155	
   156	     In addition, the visiophone is rapidly becoming a valuable 
   157	investigative tool, allowing a large number of contacts in a
   158	relatively short time.  Officers can attain visual contact of a
   159	victim, witness, or potential suspect before ever leaving the
   160	precinct.
   161	
   162	CONCLUSION
   163	
   164	     The technology of the 21st century is augmenting, not
   165	replacing, traditional police functions in Biarritz, France.
   166	Personal contact with victims and witnesses is still an
   167	important responsibility of the police department, as is sound
   168	investigative work and code enforcement.  However, advances in
   169	technology, such as the visiophone, are providing law
   170	enforcement with unprecedented opportunities in the realm of
   171	security and surveillance that can be realized today.  In this
   172	pilot program, both the police and the residents of the
   173	community are discovering that modern technology can be used
   174	effectively and responsibly to enhance security and to expand
   175	the protection and services offered by law enforcement.
