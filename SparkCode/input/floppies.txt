     5	     So,  you've just spent 400 bucks for that super piece of  software, 
     6	made  your  back-up  and  are  working  away  with  your  working  copy.  
     7	Suddenly,  while you are working with a relatively  unimportant  utility 
     8	program  on  another  disk, your disk goes bad.  This  is  not  a  major 
     9	problem.   You  have a back-up somewhere, but it gets  you  to  thinking 
    10	about your back- ups on your commercial programs.  What happens if  they 
    11	go  bad?  Should you have made them on some type of premium diskette  to 
    12	guard against that? 
    13	
    14	     You scour through catalogs and ads in magazines.  There are sources 
    15	galore  for  diskettes,  at  all prices, and  some  of  them  even  have 
    16	specifications.   You run into one spec called "Clipping Level" and  the 
    17	supplier  claims  that because his disks have been tested  to  a  higher 
    18	clipping  level they are superior.  Should you pay a premium  for  disks 
    19	with  superior  specifications?  What do these specs  mean?   Will  your 
    20	back-ups be less likely to fail if you use premium discs? 
    21	
    22	     These are difficult questions to answer.  Perhaps an explanation of 
    23	some of the tests run on disks and what can happen to your back-ups with 
    24	time  would  help  you  make that decision.  In  addition,  you  may  be 
    25	interested  in  considering the cost tradeoffs of  using  higher  priced 
    26	disks.  
    27	
    28	     As an engineer with many years of experience in magnetic  recording 
    29	I  had  never heard of the term "clipping Level" until it came up  in  a 
    30	discussion on KAY*FOG.  In fact, I had never seen a specification  sheet 
    31	in any box or bag (I buy the cheap stuff by mail order too!) of disks  I 
    32	have  purchased.  However, I did spend a couple of years as a part of  a 
    33	design  team on a Winchester Drive for personal computers and one of  my 
    34	tasks  was  the  specification and testing of the disks  used  in  those 
    35	drives.  
    36	
    37	     CLIPPING  LEVEL:  Since  magnetic media is  pretty  much  the  same 
    38	whether it is tape, diskettes, or hard disks (the major difference being 
    39	that  the material to which the magnetic particles are bonded  is  mylar 
    40	for  tape  and diskettes, and aluminum for the hard  disks),  it  wasn't 
    41	difficult  for  me to guess at what was meant by  "clipping  level."   A 
    42	little looking through a parts catalog and I found a specification on  a 
    43	chip  designed for use in disk drives and they defined "clipping  level" 
    44	(although  in rather vague terms).  It is unfortunate that  these  words 
    45	are  used  to describe a test performed on diskettes since they  have  a 
    46	different  and  more widely understood meaning  throughout  the  general 
    47	electronics  industry.  In any case we will have to accept  these  words 
    48	since they are the ones used in the advertisements.  
    49	
    50	     In  simple terms, your drive uses a "head" to read the  information 
    51	on the disk.  You can think of this as being like the needle and pick-up 
    52	on your phonograph.  The head reads the magnetic information  previously 
    53	written  on your disk and converts it into an electrical  signal.   This 
    54	signal is further processed and eventually takes on a form suitable  for 
    55	transmission  to  your computer as bits, or bytes, which  represent  the 
    56	data.  
    57	
    58	     SIGNAL  VARIATION:  The  size and shape of  the  electrical  signal 
    59	developed by the head varies for many reasons.  First of all, it  varies 
    60	as  a result of the information written on the disk, and this  variation 
    61	itself represents that information.  However, there are other variations 
    62	which  take  place  due to imperfections in  the  head,  the  mechanical 
    63	characteristics  of the drive, or imperfections in the diskette.   These 
    64	variations,  if large enough, will lead to the electronics in the  drive 
    65	not  being able to correctly decode the information, and  your  computer 
    66	will  indicate  by means of some error message that it cannot  read  the 
    67	disk.   It  is therefore important to keep these variations  (those  not 
    68	part of the data) at a minimum. 
    69	
    70	     COATING THICKNESS: Magnetic diskettes or tapes are manufactured  by 
    71	bonding  magnetic  particles  to  a  flexible  mylar  backing  material. 
    72	Characteristics  which  affect  the performance  of  the  final  product 
    73	include,  but  are not limited to, the magnetic characteristics  of  the 
    74	particles, the size of the particles [Note: it is modification of  these 
    75	two  characteristics that make the difference between a 1.2M disk and  a 
    76	360K  disk.], the thickness of the coating, and, most important  to  the 
    77	subject  of "clipping level," the uniformity of the coating.  If a  tiny 
    78	part of the disk, the size of a pinhole, does not get coated, the signal 
    79	level  recoverable  from  that spot is reduced.  Thus, if  there  are  a 
    80	number  of  these of sufficient size, the level of the  signal  will  be 
    81	fairly  uniform  until that "pin-hole" passes under the head,  at  which 
    82	point  it  will  drop.   These are referred to  as  "drop-outs"  in  the 
    83	industry.  
    84	
    85	     Furthermore,  if the coating thickness varies over the  surface  of 
    86	the  disk, the amplitude of the signal can vary in a  relatively  smooth 
    87	manner  as the disk rotates.  This is generally not a  serious  problem, 
    88	however.  
    89	
    90	     Your  drive can recover your data by separating these disk  related 
    91	variations from the variations in signal due to the real data,  provided 
    92	that disk related variations are not too large.  Typically a drive might 
    93	be  able  to successfully ignore disk related variations which  did  not 
    94	reduce  the amplitude of the real signal to less than 30% of the  normal 
    95	output.   This  number,  however,  also depends on  a  wide  variety  of 
    96	factors,  and varies from drive to drive, even the same model  from  the 
    97	same manufacturer.  
    98	
    99	     Thus, anything one could do to assure that the level of these disk- 
   100	related  variations are held within a specified range should reduce  the 
   101	probability of errors.  The key word is "probability," and more will  be 
   102	said about this later.  Therefore a disk which is tested to a  "clipping 
   103	level"  of 60% is tested to assure that the variations due to  the  disk 
   104	are small enough that the signal level never drops below 60%.  That  is, 
   105	the  variations  are held to a range between 60% and 100%.   It  follows 
   106	that  the  higher  the "clipping level," the less  variation  in  signal 
   107	output and the reduced probability of a disk error.  
   108	
   109	     Now comes the tough part.  How much extra money should you pay  for 
   110	a  disk tested to a 60% level as compared to one tested to a 40%  level? 
   111	Would  you pay 50% more?  Twice as much?  Ten times as much?  The way  I 
   112	look at it is this:  There is a high probability that if I buy 25 or  50 
   113	brand  X  disks and they all work,whatever tests were run on  them  were 
   114	probably sufficient to assure me that brand X disks will always work.  I 
   115	have  no  way of knowing what "clipping level"  disks  destined  for  my 
   116	drives  should be tested at, nor, do I believe, do the manufacturers  of 
   117	floppy disks.  
   118	     
   119	     A  WORD  ABOUT HARD DISKS:  In the case of Winchester  drives,  the 
   120	situation  is a little different.  The manufacturers of the disks  which 
   121	go  in  these drives are generally different companies than  those  that 
   122	manufacturer  to drives.  The drive manufacturer imposes  specifications 
   123	on   the  disk  manufacturer.   Furthermore,  the   drive   manufacturer 
   124	continually  tests disks using sophisticated equipment to be  sure  that 
   125	the  disk manufacturer meets these specifications.  That is, people  who 
   126	manufacture  disks for use in hard drives do not sell them  directly  to 
   127	the end user (removable hard disks being the exception).  
   128	
   129	     BOTTOM LINE $$$: But, back to floppies.  Assume I buy 100 diskettes 
   130	from  each  of two sources, SuperDisk and CheapDisk.  Assume  I  pay  40 
   131	cents  each  for  the  CheapDisks and $2.00  each  for  the  SuperDisks. 
   132	Finally,  out of all the disks I bought, one SuperDisk won't format  and 
   133	10  CheapDisks  won't  format.  I have ended  up  paying  slightly  over 
   134	$2.00/disk for the good SuperDisks and about 45 cents each for the  good 
   135	CheapDisks.  I still think I got a better buy on the CheapDisks.  
   136	
   137	     MORE  USE -- BETTER PERFORMANCE: Now, what about disk  failures  in 
   138	the  future?  That is as I use these 90 CheapDisks are they more  likely 
   139	to fail in the future that the 99 SuperDisks?  Well, I suppose there are 
   140	those  who  would argue with me that in fact they would.  But  I  really 
   141	don't  believe  it.  The reason is that the first few times  I  use  any 
   142	diskette its performance will improve.  The surface of the disk is  left 
   143	slightly  rough  (not on purpose) during the manufacturing  process  and 
   144	this process prevents good contact between the head and the disk.   This 
   145	poor contact degrades performance of the disk.  As the disk is used  and 
   146	rotated  past  the  head,  the head knocks off  some  particles  of  the 
   147	coating,  smoothing  the  surface  and improving  the  contact  and  the 
   148	performance.   In tape recording, in critical applications, new tape  is 
   149	never  used  without  running it through a machine  at  least  once  and 
   150	sometimes several times, just for this reason.  Therefore, after I  have 
   151	used my CheapDisks several times I feel more comfortable with them  than 
   152	when they were brand new.  
   153	
   154	     HOW LONG WILL THEY LAST?  Finally, what about the really long term? 
   155	Will CheapDisks retain the information stored on them equally as well as 
   156	SuperDisks,  say over a period of 100 years?  Well, here we are  dealing 
   157	with real unknowns.  There are no disks around that are a hundred  years 
   158	old.   Magnetic recording using media of the type used in disks is  only 
   159	about 40 years old.  Archival data that has been around for long periods 
   160	of  time  has turned out to be a problem in a number of fields.   Ask  a 
   161	librarian  about  the  problems  facing  the  Library  of  Congress   in 
   162	protecting many of its books.  
   163	
   164	     There  has been some experience with magnetic recording in  general 
   165	that  may  be  of  interest.   In tape, such  as  your  audio  or  video 
   166	cassettes,  or  computer tape as used on large main frames, there  is  a 
   167	problem  with long term storage known as "print through."  The  magnetic 
   168	pattern  on  the tape representing the information emanates  a  magnetic 
   169	field, just as the North and South Poles do.  This field is very minute, 
   170	but still present, and any material susceptible to being magnetized will 
   171	do  so in the presence of a magnetic field.  This is true even for  weak 
   172	fields  if the material is held still within the field for long  periods 
   173	of time. All tape is susceptible to being magnetized, that is it's prime 
   174	purpose in life.  
   175	
   176	     When wound on a reel, each piece of tape is tightly pressed against 
   177	another  one,  and  each piece emanates a field.  If the  tape  is  left 
   178	untouched  in this form for several years, a little of  the  information 
   179	recorded on each piece is transferred to mix with the information on the 
   180	adjacent  piece.   In  audio  tapes one can hear this  as  a  low  level 
   181	background of the same music that played either a few seconds earlier or 
   182	a  few seconds later, particularly where a loud passage  is  immediately 
   183	followed by a quiet one.  
   184	
   185	     Normally  disks  have a jacket around them that  is  fairly  thick.  
   186	Thus  it is unlikely that print through would take place between  disks.  
   187	On  double sided disks however, the magnetic information on one side  is 
   188	pretty  close to that on the other side, the distance being in the  same 
   189	range as that previously discussed in the case of tape on a reel.  If  I 
   190	were  to  make a guess at the first cause of long term failure,  in  the 
   191	sense of not being able to recover 100% of the material form a floppy, I 
   192	would guess that "print through" would be the cause.  
   193	
   194	     RE-COPY YOUR FLOPPIES: Someone once raised the question of  whether 
   195	it makes sense to re-copy masters or back-ups from time to time to  make 
   196	new  backups.   My  initial  reaction was that I  didn't  think  it  was 
   197	worthwhile.   Having given it some thought, however, it might not  be  a 
   198	bad  idea.  If there is a degradation that takes place with time  on  an 
   199	untouched  back-up  as  it sits on the shelf, re-copying  does  in  fact 
   200	restore the information to a more pristine state and thus acts as  added 
   201	protection  against  the  probability  of  losing  your  data.   As   to 
   202	SuperDisks being any better than CheapDisks in an archival sense, I  can 
   203	think  of no reason why there should be any difference, but  perhaps  we 
   204	won't know the answer to that for another 100 years.  
   205	
   206	     HOW COME SO CHEAP?  There are a lot of reasons SuperDisks sell  for 
   207	more  than CheapDisks.  They spend more on advertising,  and  packaging, 
   208	and possibly corporate headquarters.  They sell primarily to  companies, 
   209	which  avoid  buying anything by mail order from some  post  office  box 
   210	across  the country. And they sell at the price they do  because  people 
   211	are  willing to pay for it, whatever the reason.  In fact,  however,  if 
   212	you  look  into  it you will find that many of the  people  selling  the 
   213	cheaper diskettes are buying their raw material from the same source  as 
   214	those selling the expensive versions.  
   215	
   216	     The whole thing about mass produced products, whether it is  disks, 
   217	drives,  computers,  or  light bulbs, is that they  are  produced  on  a 
   218	statistical  basis.  That is, costs are reduced to the point  where  the 
   219	probability of a bad one getting to the user is acceptably low.  This is 
   220	simply good business.  No company can stay in business if it strives for 
   221	perfection  in a commercial product line.  Only governments  can  afford 
   222	products which have been tested to the level of a space shuttle, and  as 
   223	we found out even they are not perfect.  
   224	
   225	     Personally  I have always bought the least expensive disks I  could 
   226	find. Furthermore, I buy single sided, single density diskettes and  use 
   227	them  in double sided, double density drives, with no problem.   On  one 
   228	occasion,  I  paid  over $25.00 for a box of 10  diskettes.   It  was  a 
   229	Sunday, I needed them, and they were the only ones I could find.  One of 
   230	the disks in that box proved to be the first bad disk I ever ran into! 
   231	
   232	     One  last comment on probabilities.  If the probability of a  given 
   233	disk  failing  is  one  in  1,000  under  whatever  circumstances,   the 
   234	probability of two failing under the same circumstances is one in  1,000 
   235	times  1,000, or one in 1,000,000.  Anyone for making two 45 cent  back-
   236	ups instead of one $2.00 back-up? 
   237	
   238	     Note:  I have taken some liberties in the preceding article in  the 
   239	interests  of  keeping  it from becoming overly  technical  but  do  not 
   240	believe these affect the substance of the arguments for purchasing lower 
   241	cost  disks.  Also, I was not able to find detailed information  on  the 
   242	testing of diskettes in the literature and much of the above is based on 
   243	extending my experience from tape and hard disks to diskettes. 
   244	
   245	
   246	     I  would  appreciate it if anyone having more  information  on  the 
   247	subject,  or finding inaccuracies within the article contact  me  either
