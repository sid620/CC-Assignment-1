    30	        Spearwood Shareware Service is our authorized Australian dealer.
    31	        They will forward your order to the USA and you will receive the
    32	        absolute latest version of DOSREF by airmail straight from the
    33	        author.  This means there will be about a three week delay before
    34	        your order arrives.  We appreciate your business!
    35	
    36	        Spearwood is our dealer only; for support write or E-mail the
    37	        author, Dave Williams, at the above address.

    41	   Why support DOSREF instead of relying on one of those public domain
    42	 "interrupt lists"?  Sheer size, for one.  Even in LHarc format DOSREF
    43	 bulks out to over a megabyte, making it too large for most sysops to
    44	 consider keeping online.  Registered users also get support via:
    45	
    46	        The Courts of Chaos BBS (TechRef support board)
    47	        RIME/RelayNet
    48	        BIX
    49	        CompuServe
    50	        airmail
    51	
    52	  You get the very latest edition of this manual on disk, with no worries
    53	 about corrupted or tampered text.  DOSREF is a quality product, in use
    54	 by the US Navy, CalTech, Borland, NEC, Wang, General Motors, Citicorp,
    55	 Rockwell, Honeywell, Digital Research, Central Point Software, 20th Century
    56	 Fox, Associated Press, hospitals, universities, and government agencies
    57	 around the world.
    58	
    59	  The Registered User reference consists of over a megabyte of the compressed
    60	 technical reference, appendices, and sample source code. That's about three
    61	 megabytes of raw data when uncompressed, or several times larger than the
    62	 shareware version.
    63	
    64	  The Registered User version contains information on device drivers, mouse
    65	 programming, Virtual Control Program Interface, Microsoft Windows 2.x, hard
    66	 drives, hardware information, virus and Trojan programs, EMS 3.2, LIM 4.0,
    67	 EEMS 3.2, CD-ROM, network programming, DOS 5.0, and more.
    68	
    69	  Registered users will be advised by mail of updates.
    70	
    71	  Several people who have downloaded copies over three years old have written
    72	 to see if I was still supporting the Reference.  The answer is yes.  Not only
    73	 that, but my book contract calls for keeping the information current.  If
    74	 you're concerned, just drop a postcard.

   101	  Do you live outside the US?  If so, you're probably familiar with the
   102	 hassles of keeping up with the latest information - the three to five month
   103	 lead time for US publication, plus time for local book dealers to catalog
   104	 new releases, plus problems in trying to order... plus the delays while your
   105	 book comes in on special order, goes through Customs, the inevitable price
   106	 hikes through all the middlemen, taxes...  not only is DOSREF priced
   107	 well below the price of good printed computer books in the US, it's probably
   108	 far cheaper than you could expect to pay for US books locally.  Plus your
   109	 order will show up in your very own mailbox by air mail.
