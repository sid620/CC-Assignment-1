    10	The following HUGE collection is probably shorter than the book, and not
    11	so well edited, but it hasn't been posted in a long time, so here it is.

    16		Excerpts (edited) from net.rumor, March, 1986, with later
    17		additions, including a huge number from a rec.humor posting.  I
    18		did some reformatting and a spelling check.  Have at...

    23		The Tektronix 4051 (one of the first desk-top computers) had a
    24		microprocessor (6800 I think) deep inside it.  Although the
    25		machine's native language was Basic, there were (undocumented)
    26		hooks to download and run machine code.  The machine also had a
    27		synthesized bell.  The result, of course, was that 4051 was one
    28		of the favorite musical instruments in some parts of Tek.

    41		A friend of mine once told me how he used to do just that at U
    42		of Delaware.  He used to do it from a terminal room where you
    43		couldn't see the machine itself, but you'd know when it happened
    44		-- the disk would pull either its power plug or its connection
    45		to the mainframe off, and the machine would crash.
    46	
    47		The TRS-80 Model 1 used to put out so much RF interference, that
    48		one way of adding sound to ANY program was to put a small AM
    49		radio right by the machine, and listening to the electronic
    50		"music".  Some programs even used this trait of the trash-80,
    51		instead of connecting up the external speaker.

    56		In 1978, a company in my area which specialized in fruit orchard
    57		temperature alarm systems (it being necessary to awaken the
    58		farmers to start the smudge pots and ventilators (giant fans) in
    59		order to prevent damage to the fruit) decided they wanted to go
    60		into the TRS-80 I peripherals business.  They hired me as an
    61		engineering technician and programmer.
    62	
    63		There I was, working on programs to drive the peripherals, and
    64		having even the simplest programs crashing and going haywire for
    65		no apparent reason.  Being brought up to never assume it's the
    66		machine's fault, I spent several weeks trying to figure out what
    67		I was doing wrong.
    68	
    69		The one day my boss asked me to go to the company next door and
    70		assist them with a problem (they built hydraulic lift units,
    71		like the ones you see being used in construction...turned out we
    72		built the electronic control boxes for their lifts).  I walk
    73		into the shop, and am confronted by 12 extra heavy duty
    74		arcwelding machines (these guys were welding steel up to 2"
    75		thick!).  After solving their problem, I traced the power mains.
    76		Sure enough, we were drawing our AC feed from the same source
    77		they were, no transformers between us.
    78	
    79		A few hours, a couple of isolation transformers and caps later,
    80		and all of a sudden my code runs perfectly.
    81	
    82		The boss still didn't believe it, when I showed him the finally
    83		working code...  he had pretty much decided I was a flop as a
    84		programmer.  They decided two weeks later not to go into
    85		computers...  too volatile, they said.

    98		Back when I was an undergrad at Oberlin College, I had the
    99		pleasure of working as an operator on their Xerox Sigma 9.  The
   100		best part of the job was bringing down the machine.  The console
   101		displayed "Thhhhhhats all Folks!!!", while the processor treated
   102		you to a rendition of the Star Spangled Banner on the CPU alarm.

   106	
   107		Speaking of doing things to power lines...I remember a story I
   108		heard from my circuits professor in Colorado.  It seems that
   109		they received a computer from the government (I can't remember
   110		the make, but it wasn't anything I had heard of before).  This
   111		computer was a bit of a beast.  It ran off of 3-phase power, and
   112		had a disk that was between 3 and 4 feet in diameter.  Well,
   113		several students were involved in setting up the disk drive one
   114		night, and when the professor left he told them that they could
   115		connect everything, but not to power it up until he checked it
   116		over.
   117	
   118		Well, you know students...they wired it up and turned it on.
   119		For those of you who are not to familiar with 3-phase power, if
   120		you reverse any 2 out of the 3 wires, the polarity changes.
   121		Well, they managed to reverse 2 of the wires, causing the disk
   122		to spin backwards.  Now, since the heads are designed to float
   123		on a cushion of air above the disk, they went down instead of
   124		up, and the disk ended up with a nice groove right down the
   125		middle.  Needless to say, the prof wasn't pleased when he came
   126		in the next morning and found his nice new disk turned into so
   127		many magnetic shavings....

   132		And then there's the old trick of manipulating an IBM 029
   133		keypunch so that it punches cards which are all holes.  Great
   134		bookmarks; I still have a few.
   135	
   136		Ideally you want to have a roomful of keypunches on hand,
   137		because the mean time between jams when punching those things is
   138		only a few cards.  What would happen if one of them went into a
   139		high-speed card reader, I don't know.  The mind boggles.
   140	
   141		(For the benefit of the fuzzy-cheeked youngsters in the crowd,
   142		punchcards need a certain amount of mechanical strength to
   143		survive machine handling.  All-holes cards are weak and tear
   144		easily.  Normal punchcards are constrained to have [as I recall]
   145		at most one punch per column in rows 1-7, so that the central
   146		region of the card is mostly solid.)

   151		While working on a project at Litton Systems, I heard of this
   152		embarrassing moment.
   153	
   154		One project (for the military) required that the military
   155		supplied technicians be taught how to service the computers they
   156		had bought.  The lessons were proceeding well with the explicit
   157		instructions "Don't apply the power until we check it."
   158		Naturally, somebody jumped the gun.  Immediately, 120V AC was
   159		applied across the core memory (yes, core, not silicon).  The
   160		result?  A pile of slag and a whopping replacement bill.

   163		/ net.rumor / loral!jlh / Mar 5, 1986 /
   164	
   165		I remember 4 or 5 years back when we were running all our
   166		microcode and state machine development on a PDP 11 under RSX11.
   167		Seems time for the annual preventitive maintenance came around,
   168		and one of the tests is to ensure the drive can read and write
   169		correctly to each and every block of a disk.  The DEC field
   170		service tech looked at our rack of disks, saw one labeled 'Jay's
   171		scratch', and decided to use that for a disk.  Well, you know
   172		engineers.  A disk is a scratch disk until you put something you
   173		need on it, at which time it is the working disk.  You also know
   174		engineers never re-name a disk once it has a label on it.  Jay
   175		comes in the next day, mounts his disk, and reads out a bunch of
   176		E5's.  Seems he lost about 3 months of work, only some of which
   177		he had listings of.  I think the field service rep also caught
   178		hell for doing that to a customer's disk without asking anyone.

   181		/ net.rumor / ucla-cs!davis / Mar 6, 1986 /
   182	
   183		I was working in a somewhat large data center not to long ago.
   184		Seems the company thought they could save some money on
   185		maintenance costs by going self service.  Well it seems that a
   186		year or two later another great cost savings idea was to hire
   187		C.E.'s that had only 6 months training in the electronics
   188		field!!!  Well the time came to install a new super
   189		minicomputer, tape cabinet, and disk cabinet.  Well they put the
   190		new C.E.  in charge of the whole project.  He connected the
   191		cables from the disk cabinet to the CPU, then connected the
   192		cables from the tape drive to the CPU.  All set!
   193	
   194		He plugged in the tape drive and then the disk cabinet to A.C.
   195		When he went to plug in the CPU he noticed that the electrical
   196		outlet was a different kind than that of the computer.  But this
   197		C.E.  was smart.  He thought of a way that he could remove the
   198		plug and install a plug that would fit in the outlet.  (Then the
   199		company would not have to pay for an electrician).  Good Idea
   200		except that he switched the HOT and the GROUND wires when
   201		installing the new plug.  As we all know computers are well
   202		grounded.  Well the grounding also is good in cables that
   203		connect to peripherals as well as within the peripherals
   204		themselves.  Of course this bright C.E.  turned on the disk
   205		cabinet, tape cabinet, and CPU before plugging in the CPU plug.
   206	
   207		You should have seen the smoke and sparks when he plugged in the
   208		CPU.  The tape drive was shot, the disk cabinet was shot and the
   209		CPU was shot!!!!!  At least none of the terminals were connected
   210		at the time.  It took 4 C.E.s 1 week of constant work to repair
   211		the damage.  Ever see a memory board with the chips blown to
   212		kingdomcome?

   221		In 1970 ('71?)  Fresno State's computer room was the target of a
   222		firebomb thrown by some protesting students.  The fire
   223		department arrived and hosed everything down.  The fire damage
   224		was negligible.  But then the FD decided that since it was
   225		electrical equipment, they should be using CO2 extinguishers
   226		instead.
   227	
   228		Either water or CO2 would have been okay alone; but when the CO2
   229		was sprayed on top of the water, it formed carbolic acid [or is
   230		it carbonic, I don't remember].  Destroyed all of the equipment,
   231		the disks, and the tapes.  Took about a year and a half to
   232		recreate their records from hardcopy.

   239		machine after observing that almost all of the damage was bent
   240		sheet metal and unplugged connectors.  He supposedly set up a
   241		service bureau in his home.  I'm not sure I believe this story.

   251		When MCIMail first went on the air, they charged for hardcopy
   252		mail delivery by the character (actually, 5000-character unit).
   253		You could mail yourself or a friend a few reams of paper for $1
   254		by sending a file of formfeeds.  They fixed their charging when
   255		we pointed this out.
   256	
   257		Also, their password-generator occasionally spits out somewhat
   258		racy words (they have the form consonant-vowel-consonant-...
   259		-vowel, 8 characters in all).  The generator checks for most of
   260		the obvious bad ones, but it seems a few must slip by the
   261		censors.  We suggested that they ought to charge extra for the
   262		racy ones, on the grounds that they would be so much easier to
   263		remember.  This idea was rejected, though its originator got
   264		such a password for the thought.

   279		Not only is it true, it has also happened a lot more than just
   280		once.  In fact, this is one of the simplest computer scams
   281		going.  One of the cleverest ones I ever heard about involved
   282		someone working for a company (a fruit company, I believe) who
   283		had the computer change (just slightly) the recorded times (and
   284		prices) of the company's transactions on the commodities
   285		exchanges.  His profits came from the slight changes (say,1/16
   286		of a point) in the contract prices that occur all the time
   287		during a normal trading day.
   288	
   289		I have seen several books which talk about these and other
   290		schemes in detail.  Unfortunately, the names and dates are often
   291		not revealed as most companies are loath to have the general
   292		public find out the ease with which these types of crimes can be
   293		carried out, as well as the difficulty of discovering them once
   294		they have occurred.  One of the most revealing items is the fact
   295		that computer criminals are almost always caught only because
   296		discrepancies in their lifestyles are noted (e.g.  buying a
   297		40-foot yacht on a $20k salary).  In fact, the longest running
   298		crime I heard about, which involved a programmer (I believe) in
   299		a prominent New York bank, went on for close to 10 years.  The
   300		culprit escaped detection so long because he had a $30,000-a-
   301		month gambling habit and was losing his illegal income as fast
   302		as he got it.  He was finally caught when his bookie was
   303		arrested as part of a police 'sting' operation, and his name was
   304		found on the books as one of the largest customers.
   305	
   306		As for finding more out about such things, all the information I
   307		have came from browsing through the MIT engineering library for
   308		a few afternoons, so I imagine that any good college library
   309		should have at least some material on this.  Good luck in
   310		finding out some actual names and dates, however!

   315		My mom (a CPA) was on an audit of a large S & L several years
   316		ago where they caught somebody doing this.  As I recall, the
   317		person was getting away with around $10-20K a year with the scam
   318		(not quite "megabucks", but still pretty healthy).
   319	
   320		The roundoff error was pretty much invisible to the auditors.
   321		The tricky part for the crook was actually writing the check (or
   322		funds transfer) so he could collect the money.  This was what
   323		showed up on the books someplace and resulted in him getting
   324		caught.

   334		There are exceptions.  During the fifties a military clerk
   335		working for the NSA had a wreck in his hydroplane.  Since he had
   336		access to a lot a top secret data they assigned an agent to
   337		watch over him while he was under anesthesia to ensure that he
   338		wouldn't babble anything.  It wasn't until later when he
   339		disappeared and moved to Moscow that anyone thought to ask how a
   340		low paid clerk could afford to buy a hydroplane.

   345		I've resisted for many days, but I give up.  My friend Doug used
   346		to work in a bank, in the OLD days.  Their master file was on
   347		punched cards, with FOUR accounts per card.  After Doug had
   348		programmed the daily update and put it in production, the bank
   349		examiners came to him saying, "We have noticed a drop in
   350		revenues in the minimum-balance account."  Doug explained his
   351		program:  "...and when the average balance for the month is
   352		below the minimum, the surcharge is applied."  They said, "No,
   353		no!  When the current balance has EVER fallen below the minimum,
   354		the surcharge should be applied."  Doug said that didn't seem
   355		very fair, but they made the rules and he would fix the program.
   356	
   357		Months later, the examiners came round again, quite
   358		suspiciously.  They told him that they had noticed another drop
   359		in revenues in the minimum balance account.  Doug explained that
   360		he had fixed the program, but he would surely look into the
   361		matter right away.  After examining his program again, he went
   362		into the computer room to check the actual deck of cards that
   363		the operators used.  He soon discovered the problem.
   364	
   365		He had added four patch cards to the end of the deck, one for
   366		each account on a master file card.  Three of them were gone.
   367		It seems that as the deck was used day after day, the last card
   368		had gotten grubbier and grubbier.  Eventually, the card reader
   369		would not feed it.  But the program seemed to work fine anyway!
   370		Then the new last card died, etc.
   371	
   372		The bank examiners were satisfied.  Doug was relieved.  And now
   373		we all know that patching is not the right way to go.

   378		A fellow I worked with once told me a horror story that happened
   379		when he was working as an operator at MIT.
   380	
   381		The system they were using had recently been converted to using
   382		a new type of coated fiberglass disk, to replace the old, heavy
   383		metal-platter kind.  No problem there.  Well, the system they
   384		had this "Emergency Stop" plug on it that you would pull when an
   385		emergency occurred (they assumed it was for, say, a flood in the
   386		machine room).  One late evening, a couple of the operators were
   387		sitting around being bored, and decided to see what would happen
   388		when they pulled "Emergency Stop".  Immediately after pulling
   389		it, they heard a strange sound in the disk cabinet.  Looking
   390		over, they saw an arm emerge from the side of the cabinet, on

   412		NBS was running version 6 Unix on a PDP-11/45 with four RL02

   423		Ok, my two quickies...
   424	
   425		Several years ago I was working on a portable real-time system
   426		we had custom built (using an LSI-11/1, 4KB, home-brewed O/S.)
   427		There were two of them in the universe and were working hard on
   428		two separate research studies.  Filled my heart with glee when I
   429		went to lift mine and out of its guts poured several ounces of
   430		coffee...(not me, never found out who.)

   432		A couple of years ago I was drinking coffee in my favorite
   433		coffee shop (maybe I should just stay away from the coffee!)
   434		when their phone rang, they shouted from behind the counter that
   435		it was for me, there was an alarm going in one of the machine
   436		rooms and I should get right over there.

   438		Ran over to find an operator standing there with a finger on the
   439		Halon hold button, we had a two zone alarm going so it was about
   440		to dump the tanks (I remember the operator looking very pleased
   441		at their current career choice).  It didn't look like there was
   442		any fire, so I began running around pulling up floor tiles
   443		(after, of course, disabling the fire system) looking for the
   444		offending sensors, 90Db going off in my ears.  Suddenly I notice
   445		this bad stinging pain in my arm, great I'm thinking, the big

   463		Speaking of 7094s, I once worked at an installation that had two
   464		of these.  The "console printer" on these computers was a large
   465		machine that looked (and maybe was) a 407 accounting machine.
   466		The 7094 didn't have any kind of internal clock but the 407 did
   467		and its patch panel was wired up so every time a line was
   468		printed on it, the time was appended at the right margin.  Thus
   469		elapsed time of a job could be determined by looking at the time
   470		printed when the $JOB card was printed and when the EXIT message
   471		was printed.
   472	
   473		Someone found out, however, that the timer did not advance while
   474		printing was in progress, so the times were a little inaccurate.
   475		To get a free run on the computer, all you had to do was keep
   476		the 407 continually busy and the timer would never advance.  A
   477		program could issue a print to the printer every so often (not
   478		very often due to the slowness of the printer) and never be
   479		billed for a cent.  It did drive the operators crazy though
   480		because everytime a line was printed on the 407, they went over
   481		to look to see if it was telling them something significant to
   482		the running of the job.

   498		A while back I was the tech support person for a minicomputer
   499		OEM.  Our customers were located all over the SF Bay area, we
   500		were located in Sunnyvale.  Since the customers were spread
   501		around, I usually tried to diagnose and fix problem over the
   502		phone.
   503	
   504		One day a Berkeley customer called me to complain that there
   505		were sparks and bad smells coming from the computer.  I assured
   506		him that that was ridiculous - computers don't generate sparks.
   507		He said that it sure did - every time he tried to plug in his
   508		modem.  I told him to try it again while I was on the phone, so
   509		I could try to diagnose the problem.  He laid the phone's
   510		handset on the table rather than putting me on hold (it wouldn't
   511		reach over to the computer, but it was in the same room).
   512		Things were quiet for a few seconds, and then I could hear a
   513		loud yelp that made its way across the computer room and through
   514		the phone.  He came back on the line and said the computer had
   515		bit him.
   516	
   517		Clearly, this was an on-site job - not something I could
   518		diagnose from his description - so I drove up to Berkeley.  When
   519		I got there, I saw the flat ribbon cable that connected the
   520		modem to the terminal interface - the power wire was on the
   521		edge, and for the whole length of the cable the plastic
   522		insulation had melted off, leaving the bare wires.  Hmmm, I
   523		thinks to myself, what could cause such a thing?
   524	
   525		I whipped out my handy-dandy volt-o-meter and tested the outlets
   526		to which the various pieces of equipment had been connected.
   527		All were 110 volts -- looked good.  It finally occurred to me to
   528		check the polarity of the sockets -- and sure enough -- they
   529		were wired wrong.  It was a very old building, and whoever had
   530		done the latest wiring in the computer room was obviously no fan
   531		of consistency.  The modem and the computer tried to share a
   532		common ground, but in reality there was a whopping potential
   533		difference between them, and when they were hooked up, sure
   534		enough, the computer generated sparks and bad smells --
   535		something computers are not generally supposed to do.

   540		Okay, one more computer "horror" story -- this one's kind of
   541		cute.
   542	
   543		We were trying to sell a $60,000 system to a family-run company
   544		whose "computer expert" was in his 60's.  We had a program
   545		called "Biosum" that would calculate the biorhythms for two
   546		people and add the sine waves together and tell you how
   547		compatible the two people are.
   548	
   549		The day of the biggest demo, the customer brings in his mother
   550		(head of the clan) to see what the company is going to be
   551		shelling out their money for.  The customer wanted to show his
   552		mother something fun on the computer, so we fired up Biosum.
   553		Unfortunately, the mother had been born in the 1800's, and you
   554		know how sloppy BASIC programmers are when it comes to date
   555		conversions - especially 18 year-old programmers who think "20
   556		years ago" qualifies as ancient history.  When the program asked
   557		for her birthdate and she typed it in (she was just starting to
   558		get a thrill out of the machine), the program crashed very
   559		ungracefully.  Talk about embarrassing...
   560	
   561		They bought the system anyway, but I don't think the matriarch
   562		ever really liked it.

   570	
   571		There was a computer system that was experiencing intermittent
   572		power failures that were proving impossible to track down.
   573		Every means of recording device and electrical filter was used,
   574		but to no avail.  The power failures always seemed to happen
   575		soon after lunch time, but for no apparent reason.  After months
   576		of agonizing work, the technician finally figured it out:
   577	
   578		The room on the other side of the wall from the computer room
   579		was the men's bathroom.  The grounding for the computer room
   580		circuits went to the water pipes that serviced one of the
   581		toilets.  The building was rather old, and the toilets were in
   582		some need of repair.  It seems that when one sat on the toilet
   583		seat, the weight of the sittee would cause the whole
   584		construction to lean forward a bit - not much, but enough to
   585		cause the marginally attached grounding wires to separate from
   586		the water pipes as the pipes bent along with the toilet - voila
   587		- the computer re-boots.

   614		Pat Hume, one of the very senior profs in CS at U of T, once
   615		told the story of how he broke the FERUT.  FERUT was FERranti U
   616		of T, one of the first computers in Canada -- a great
   617		vacuum-tube monster.  It had something like a ten-step procedure
   618		for powerdown.  From time to time this machine got modified.
   619		One day Hume was the last user of the day, and the time came to
   620		shut it down.  Somebody had added an extra step to the shutdown
   621		procedure, presumably as the result of some modification, but
   622		either the writing was illegible or the instructions weren't
   623		clear.  He did the best he could, and smoke started coming out.
   624		He hastily finished the powerdown procedure, and called
   625		Ferranti.  They naturally said "your service contract is nine to
   626		five, we'll be there tomorrow morning".
   627	
   628		Next morning, the Ferranti technical crew showed up and spent
   629		all morning in the machine room.  From Hume's description, one
   630		got the impression of technicians half-inside the computer
   631		briskly hurling parts out.  Hume, a rather junior professor at
   632		the time, sat in his office all morning waiting for the word on
   633		the multi-million-dollar computer he'd broken.  People walking
   634		past in the hall would look in with pitying expressions.
   635	
   636		Towards noon, the Ferranti senior man walked into Hume's office
   637		with a double armload of parts, dumped them on his desk, and
   638		said "that's it".  Machine restored to operation, junior
   639		professor not having to contemplate spending the next fifty
   640		years paying back its price...  But the really cute part was
   641		that the machine's reliability was markedly better after this
   642		episode.  He'd managed to apply just enough stress to blow out
   643		all the marginal parts.

   653		(Being a hardware engineer at heart, I still shiver when I think

   655	
   656		Seams there was a cleaning lady that was assigned to the floor
   657		that had the computer on it (a Zerox SIGMA 5 if it really

   659		raised tile floor just had to be cleaned up.  After seeing that
   660		the soap and wax did not take all the marks out, she then tried
   661		steel wool!
   662

   664	
   665		Since the cooling fans draw from the bottom, all the evaporating

   667		PC cards and backplane made a good home for all the small pieces
   668		of steel wool that flew by later.

   673		Yet another old classic war story.
   674	
   675		It seems that there was a certain university that was doing
   676		experiments in behavior modification in response to brain
   677		stimulation in primates.  They had this monkey with a number of
   678		electrodes embedded in it's brain that were hooked up to a
   679		PDP-11.  They had several programs that would stimulate
   680		different parts of the monkey's brain, and they had spent over a
   681		year training the monkey to respond to certain stimuli.
   682	
   683		Well, eventually the PDP developed problems, and field service
   684		was called in.  Due to some miscommunication, the field service
   685		representative was not informed of the delicacy of this
   686		particular setup, and the people running the experiment were not
   687		informed that field service was coming to fix the machine.  The
   688		FS representative then booted up a diagnostic system I/O
   689		exerciser.  After several minutes of gyrations, the monkey
   690		expired, its brain fried.

   698		large main frame manufacture previously.
   699	
   700		It seems they delivered a new machine to an overseas site and
   701		during installation every time they applied power to one of the
   702		memory bays they blew every circuit breaker in the computer
   703		room.  After resetting the circuits they again applied power to
   704		the memory bay with the same results.  Since this was a new
   705		machine they crated it up and shipped it back and got a
   706		replacement.
   707	
   708		When they got the damaged memory bay back the started to tear it
   709		down to fine the cause of the short.  Well what they found was a
   710		small hole about 3/8 in.  in diameter going from top to bottom
   711		through some of the memory arrays, which cause a very effective
   712		short.  After a lot of research they found the cause.
   713	
   714		It seems that after the memory had passed test and evaluation
   715		and quality assurance the bay was crated and put in the
   716		warehouse to await delivery.  At some time during its storage an
   717		electrician was hired to do some work and since it was a secure
   718		building the security guard had do go with him.  The electrician
   719		at one point said that he had to go back down to his truck to
   720		get a drill and the guard asked why and the electrician said he
   721		needed to drill a hole right here (pointing to a spot on the
   722		floor).  The guard then responded by pulling out his sidearm and
   723		proceeded to blow a hole at the appropriate spot which happened
   724		to be right above where the memory bay was being stored.
   725	
   726		The last he knew the guard had been reprimanded and re-assigned

   753		This reminds me of a nasty accident I had in the Power
   754		Electronics Laboratory.  I had a terminal connected to a
   755		6809-based microcomputer board.  The board was in turn connected
   756		through an interface, driver circuit and isolation transformer
   757		to an SCR power module.  The module was connected directly to
   758		the 117-volt line, which was protected by a 50-amp breaker.
   759	
   760		In the course of debugging the circuit, I had connected an
   761		oscilloscope -- isolated, of course -- to the circuit.  I
   762		connected one channel, with its ground wire, to some point in
   763		the power circuit.  I had other channels of the scope connected
   764		to the microcomputer interface.  I understood that the
   765		microcomputer ground now became hot, but this was okay since the
   766		microcomputer power supply and terminal were both isolated -- or
   767		so I thought.  Then I turned on the 50-amp breaker switch to
   768		energize the power circuit.  BANG!!!
   769	
   770		A large current, enough to pop the 15-amp breaker supplying the
   771		computer and terminal, went from the power circuit, through one
   772		set of scope leads, through the scope, through another set of
   773		scope leads, through the computer ground trace, through the
   774		ground wire in the RS-232 cable and into the terminal.  The
   775		goddamn terminal had its RS-232 signal ground strapped to the
   776		earth ground in the 117-volt line.  The current blew a trace on
   777		the computer board.  When it finished off that path, it
   778		proceeded to find the path of next lowest resistance -- the line
   779		driver and receiver chips in the computer board and the
   780		terminal.
   781	
   782		All four chips, plus some TTL chips in the terminal, were burned
   783		out.  But one of those chips had a hole blown right through it!
   784		I could see remains of the substrate through the hole.
   785		Fortunately, the 15-amp breaker tripped before anything else was
   786		damaged.  But the 15-amp breaker was slightly damaged -- it
   787		tends to stick a little upon turning on.  (I left my mark in the
   788		lab.)
   789	
   790		All of this goes to prove that that third wire in the line cord
   791		does not always promote safety.  In this case, it created a
   792		hazard.  From now on, I will always use a ground cheater for
   793		terminals when working in that lab.

   798		I have two quick but nasty stories.  These are true so for
   799		everyone who has been defending horror stories in net.rumor by
   800		saying there all folk lore, sorry.
   801	
   802		Back in the summer of '84 I was setting up a PC lab at my
   803		school.  We were converting an old chem.  lab, and of course had
   804		to make some major modifications, including installing air
   805		conditioning to handle the heat.  After setting up about 50 Dec
   806		Pro 350s we had the normal break in trouble but soon everything
   807		settled down and ran fine until about mid October.
   808	
   809		I came in one Saturday morning to open the lab and found it a
   810		little warm, but didn't think anything about it.  After cramming
   811		close to 100 freshmen into the lab to work on their homework,
   812		the temperature reached close to 90 and 3/4s of the machines
   813		were down with random hardware errors.  Seems that building
   814		services had decided on Friday afternoon that it was time to
   815		turn off the air conditioner, and fire up the heat for the
   816		winter.  They had of course locked the door behind them, and we
   817		had riveted all the windows shut that summer to prevent theft.
   818		The whole lab was down until late Monday when we finally
   819		convinced building services that we would need our air
   820		conditioner all winter.
   821	
   822		The cause of the second one was a little more difficult to find.
   823		Recently one of our customers was having trouble with a group of
   824		terminals getting periodic line noise, sometimes to the point of
   825		locking up the comm processor.  After finding nothing wrong in
   826		the hard or software a team of crack support people went to
   827		site.  There they found a bunch of RS232 lines almost 600 ft.
   828		long that ran through an elevator shaft.  Every time the
   829		elevator came by with it's big electric motor on top the RS232
   830		line would pick up the RF noise like any good antenna and drive
   831		the comm board insane.

   840	
   841		The most amusing incident I've ever heard along these lines (I
   842		*think* I read it in the book _Computer_Crime_) involved a guy
   843		who modified a payroll program for his large company.  The
   844		program processed an alphabetically-sorted list of employees, so
   845		he would shave a few cents from each account as he processed,
   846		then make the results into a check for the last guy in the list
   847		-- which happened to be one he had set up with his mailing
   848		address on it.  The name was really flaky, started with "Zy" or
   849		something like that.  Anyway, his employer decided to do a
   850		morale-boost/public-relations move by awarding a trip or
   851		something neat like that to the first and last employee in the
   852		personnel/payroll database....It didn't take them long to link
   853		the non-existent employee at the end with the programmer in
   854		question.

   858	
   859		This is the truth as I know it, but with enough mystery to
   860		constitute rumor.
   861	
   862		Back in college I knew a real whiz, the sort of guy who cut his
   863		computer classes because he was off consulting for Large Unnamed
   864		Companies, but passed them anyway.  Well, once he showed up with
   865		a substantial bandage on his elbow, covering stitches, after
   866		being gone a couple of days.  He wouldn't say much, only that
   867		he'd been standing too close to a disc drive when it exploded,
   868		and that his job was destructive testing.
   869	
   870		Later he told me a story of how he'd purposely blown a large
   871		system, which the experts at the company said couldn't be done,
   872		as part of this testing.  He said he downloaded some software to
   873		a system in a locked room thousands of miles way, and saw the
   874		results on closed circuit TV.
   875	
   876		The system had a CPU in the middle and a line of disc drives on
   877		each side.  He claims he caused the drives to blow up, starting
   878		at the outsides and working in, at just the right times to
   879		propagate a combined shock wave into the CPU.  If that wasn't
   880		enough, just as the shock wave arrived, he had the CPU power
   881		supply do something nasty which smoked the circuits.
   882	
   883		Apparently this was all production hardware, so naturally the
   884		company (supposedly one of the three-letter-acronym giants)
   885		didn't want word to get out.
   886		___________
   887	
   888		I think this guy was the same one who told me a gory story about
   889		a high-speed removable-cartridge disc drive with a cover
   890		interlock.  When the drive was spinning you couldn't open the
   891		cover.  The story is that the interlock was broken, but an
   892		operator didn't notice the disc was still spinning when he
   893		lowered a pack removal cover on it.  He was holding the cover by
   894		a center handle that immediately went to high RPMs, and you can
   895		imagine the rest.

   903		True story from my own past.
   904	
   905		I worked for a small business dp timesharing and software
   906		development firm in Stamford, Connecticut in 1976.  We were so
   907		successful in OEMing DEC PDP-11s with our business software that
   908		year that the owner decided to give himself a treat.  He moved
   909		out of his nondescript office suite and moved into a penthouse
   910		suite in a professional building.  In fact, he proudly
   911		announced, we'd be the highest point in Stamford and have a
   912		great view.
   913	
   914		Well, we moved in (quite a struggle since the elevator only went
   915		to the floor below) and started processing again, and within the
   916		weak started to notice a larger than usual number of soft
   917		crashes.  Then we had a hard disk crash.  Naturally we suspected
   918		that things had been jarred in the move or coming up the stairs.
   919		We had a FE come in and check it out and repair the disk.  The
   920		FE didn't find anything wrong.  The same thing happened the next
   921		week; we lost a hard disk and suffered numerous soft crashes
   922		which we tracked down to faulty disk reads.  FE came out, and
   923		looked for the problem and couldn't find it when all of a sudden
   924		he detects a surge on our power.  So, we are told we need a
   925		clean power line.
   926	
   927		Next week we have an electrician in and get a clean line pulled
   928		up 14 stories.  But still we have these hard and soft disk
   929		failures.  Frustrated, we have the FE call in a specialist.  The
   930		specialist comes in doesn't find anything right away, then
   931		suddenly "blip" detects a surge on our ground!?  So, they tell
   932		us we need a clean ground.  We get an electrician and tell him
   933		this, and he looks at us strange but puts in a new ground.  Next
   934		week same thing; lots of soft disk errors and this time we lose
   935		two platters on our 11/45 (recently arrived 11/03 with only
   936		floppy disks is cruising just fine though).
   937	
   938		We're really frustrated now, our MTBF (which we report to our
   939		customers in the monthly service level report) is in the toilet!
   940		The owner is hot about this.  DEC local FE and specialist can't
   941		figure it out.  Finally, they call in an engineer from Mass.  He
   942		strolls through our front door walks over to where the 11/45
   943		(including disks in same cabinet) is, right next to the window.
   944		He doesn't even look at the computer, just stares out the window
   945		for a few seconds.  Finally, he turns to us and says,
   946		"Interesting, by the way, can you tell me what those antennas
   947		are for?"  as he points out the window at the other side of the
   948		roof.
   949	
   950		"I don't know, just TV antennas I guess" says my boss.  The
   951		engineer asks us to call maintenance just to check.  Meanwhile
   952		this engineer is showing the local FE and specialist how he can
   953		get blips on his scope from the venetian blinds, his tie clip
   954		and just about everything else.  Turns out the antennas were
   955		microwave and radio paging antennas.  This being the high point
   956		in Stamford made it an ideal site (in fact the antenna rented
   957		for 10X the price of the penthouse suite!).  Everytime some
   958		doctor was paged in Stamford, the antennas would send out a
   959		signal that induced a current in everything around.  Being only
   960		20 feet away everything in our office was hit especially in our
   961		hard disks which used a magnet and induction coil to position
   962		the heads over the proper track!  Some signals would cause the
   963		head to over or undershoot the specified track causing the soft
   964		crashes, while others cause the head to actually hit the
   965		platter.  The floppies on the 11/03 weren't affected because
   966		they didn't use induction coils.
   967	
   968		They had to move the office down to the first floor where it had
   969		a view of...  the parking lot!  (However, in fairness to the
   970		11/45 and its disks I must also say that it later did a long
   971		stint at one of our customer's sites, in a "Polyfill" factory.
   972		The fibers in the air were so thick that the filters on the air
   973		conditioner had to be cleaned daily or it would actually burn
   974		out--but the 11/45 and disks functioned smoothly (I, however got
   975		a raging sore throat and sometime will find I have some lung
   976		disease!))

   984		I once got to visit the data processing shop for Frito-Lay
   985		headquarters in Dallas, Texas (there's a Dallas in Oregon, too,
   986		you know).  They are a huge IBM shop...
   987	
   988		The favorite war story at Frito-Lay was about the arrival of a
   989		new 308x (not sure of exact model) mainframe.  It was one of the
   990		first that IBM shipped - possibly a beta-unit.  The guts of the
   991		machine are liquid-cooled - when you look inside the machine you
   992		see what look like liquid cooled heads from a modern motorcycle.
   993		In any case, the machine literally melted down one night.
   994		Turned out that the cleaning crew decided they needed some water
   995		for window washing...  The spigot for the coolant supply was
   996		mounted on the top of the cabinet and equipped with a standard
   997		looking water valve!

  1005		It seems a customer was having trouble with the floppy drive on
  1006		his 9836 computer.  He would write his files to disk every night
  1007		before he went home to find the next morning the disks were
  1008		unreadable.  This went on for a few weeks so he decided to call
  1009		HP.  After the usual telephone interrogation the CE decided he
  1010		would have to go on-site.
  1011	
  1012		The CE tried to read the customer's floppy to no avail.
  1013		Assuming a damaged disk, they tried a new one.  To test the
  1014		drive the CE initialized a new floppy, installed it into the
  1015		drive, wrote a file only to read it back perfectly.  Being a
  1016		good CE he cleaned the heads on the disk drive, ran the
  1017		diagnostics and sure enough, everything looked fine.  Since both
  1018		he and the customer were satisfied no problem existed, they
  1019		decided the disk PM was worth the trip.
  1020	
  1021		The next day the customer called the CE back because his disks
  1022		were unreadable.  The CE went back to the customer site and
  1023		again, the disks were unreadable.  He reviewed the command
  1024		sequence used to create the files and all was correct.  They
  1025		cleaned the heads again, ran the diagnostics only to discover no
  1026		problems.  A new, initialized floppy worked fine.  Just in case
  1027		the diagnostics had gone awry, the CE, over the next couple of
  1028		weeks, began to replace parts of the two drives.  (Intermittent
  1029		problems are always the most difficult to expose.)  Finally the
  1030		customer had two brand new drives only to find he could not read
  1031		his disks.
  1032	
  1033		The CE, becoming very frustrated, asked himself,"If I were a
  1034		floppy disk why would I become unreadable?"  EUREKA!!
  1035	
  1036		It seems that every night, so that he would not forget to bring
  1037		his files to work the next day, the customer would put them in a
  1038		convenient place-right next to the door.  HE HAD THEM STUCK TO
  1039		THE FRIDGE WITH A MAGNET!!  Of course the CE checked the
  1040		immediate area of the computer for anything magnetic, but who
  1041		would have thought...

  1066		Date:  28 Jan 89
  1067	
  1068		I started there:
  1069	
  1070		1) A computer kept crashing, and every time service was called,
  1071		it worked fine.  It turned out that one of the users would come
  1072		in, sit down at the console and put his papers and stuff on the
  1073		top covering the cooling vents.  When it crashed, he'd pick up
  1074		his stuff and leave, removing the evidence.  Service people
  1075		didn't figure this one out until they decided to watch him work
  1076		to see why it crashed.
  1077	
  1078		2) We had an IBM cluster controller controlling some 3270
  1079		terminals.  We paid $5000 for an upgrade that would allow more
  1080		users to be connected to the controller.  The IBM service rep
  1081		came in and REMOVED a board, that was put there to deliberately
  1082		slow things down.
  1083	
  1084		3) (This one happened to me) A Northern Telecom 3270 terminal
  1085		caught fire, with flames coming out of the top.  I guess I was
  1086		doing some hot stuff.  I was not putting stuff on top of the
  1087		terminal cooling slots.
  1088	
  1089		4) Somebody working on an Airline Reservation System, trying to
  1090		get maximum response out of the machine, was looking at a OS
  1091		listing and found a delay loop that was executed by a timer
  1092		interrupt every 100th of a second.  Removing it brought the
  1093		performance up, but they had to replace one of the chips in the
  1094		machine that wasn't fast enough.

  1100	
  1101		...the GE 415 and 425 CPUs were identical except that the 415
  1102		had an extra wire that slowed the clock down a bit.  To upgrade
  1103		to the 425, after paying your money, the wire was removed.  Some
  1104		users knew about this and one of them made up a realistic
  1105		looking letter supposedly from GE saying something to the
  1106		effect:  "CAUTION.  Do not remove the wire from pin 4AB to 7FL
  1107		in the CPU enclosure.  This wire is located approximately 7
  1108		inches up from the bottom of the backplane in bay 2 and should
  1109		not be removed by using a GE 112-3 wire unwrapping tool, first
  1110		not removing the wrapping from 4AB, then pulling the wire from
  1111		under the other wiring to its bound end at 7FL, followed by not
  1112		unwrapping the bound end from 7FL.  Not removing this wire will
  1113		result in the normal clockspeed which is 1.6 times slower than
  1114		with the wire removed and will not cause corresponding increases
  1115		in system throughput."  Naturally most of these wires got
  1116		removed.
  1117	
  1118		Another interesting but kludgy fix to a problem came from a user
  1119		of an IBM 7044.  The 7044 had a HALT instruction that stopped
  1120		the CPU clock.  The user was doing some realtime processing or
  1121		something of the sort and didn't like the idea of the CPU ever
  1122		being able to stop itself.  He asked IBM how much it would cost
  1123		to disable the instruction and they gave him some large quote
  1124		which contained the implicit message "We don't want to do it and
  1125		this price is set high enough to make you change your mind about
  1126		the request."  The user didn't want to pay the money so he fixed
  1127		up a photodiode over the light on the console that was on when
  1128		the CPU was running and hooked it up to a solenoid that would
  1129		push the RUN button whenever the light went out.  The cost was a
  1130		couple of dollars.

  1205		Yet another true story:
  1206	
  1207		I was at GE Consulting's Training and Education Center in
  1208		Albany, NY taking a course on the PC.  Well, there were some
  1209		inexperienced PC users there, so we had to go through the
  1210		"basics" for them (ie, the do's and don't's of disk handling)
  1211	
  1212		Well, according to the instructor, there had been one student
  1213		who had driven up from Bridgeport, CT (corporate offices are
  1214		there).  He had stayed at a nearby motel overnight, leaving his
  1215		briefcase in the trunk of the car.  (Oh, let me add that it was
  1216		sub-zero weather at the time of this incident).  In the morning
  1217		he arrived at T&E, opened up his briefcase, took out a floppy
  1218		disk, inserted into a drive...  then *c-r-a-c-k*!!!  It
  1219		shattered into little pieces.

  1240		How about the young computer salesman giving some client a
  1241		demonstration of the new electronic word-processor?  He loads up
  1242		a large document, and says:  "watch this!".  He hits a couple of
  1243		keys, and converts every "i" in the document to an "a", making
  1244		the text unreadable.
  1245	
  1246		"And it you can change it all back, just like this" he
  1247		proclaims, subsequently converting all "a"s back to "i",
  1248		including those that had been "a"s originally.
  1249	
  1250		Of course, it happened to a friend of a friend of mine.. :-)
  1251	
  1252		Another one my father told me:
  1253	
  1254		My dad was an electronics engineer in Greece, for a company that
  1255		imported various high-tech lab equipment.  One of them (A HP
  1256		spectrophotometer, I think) was controlled by a special built-in
  1257		computer, running optional proprietary software.  Each optional
  1258		package was copy protected.  To enforce that, installing the
  1259		package could only be done by a tech-rep; after the
  1260		installation, the disks were automatically erased, and the
  1261		program was kept in battery-backed RAM.
  1262	
  1263		Anyway, at some point the computer lost all its programs.  A
  1264		call had to be made to Germany, for new disks to be sent as a
  1265		replacement.  My dad could not find the reason for this, and he
  1266		was really surprised when the client called again, with the same
  1267		problem next week.  Call Germany again, install the disks again,
  1268		then next week guess what happened:  The lab calls again.  But
  1269		there was a definite pattern:  The lab always found the system
  1270		down on a Wednesday morning.  Obviously, whatever went wrong
  1271		happened on Tuesday nights only....
  1272	
  1273		After more than a month of downtime, someone realized that the
  1274		cleaning lady came to the room every Tuesday night.  Someone
  1275		went to check her and found out that she carried a nine-year old
  1276		kid with her.  The kid had discovered the machine's on-off
  1277		switch, with a few buttons next to it.  When the machine was on,
  1278		pressing those buttons made cute sounds (audible warnings!)
  1279		which are supposed to alert you to the fact that holding the
  1280		button down for a few seconds would completely reset the
  1281		machine.  I guess the kid thought of it as an oversized musical
  1282		instrument.  The mom turned the machine off before she left,
  1283		erasing error codes etc.  No-one knows how much this story cost
  1284		the lab in downtime.....

  1394		I have two stories to relate.  Both have to do with IBM machines
  1395		(the large variety):
  1396	
  1397		1) Back when core memory was in use one could "listen" to the
  1398		   memory with a transistor radio.  A game among system
  1399		   programmers was to access memory in such a manner as to
  1400		   produce recognizable tunes on the radio.
  1401	
  1402		2) Printers produce a buzzing with varying frequency depending
  1403		   on the text being printed (this is because of the rate at
  1404		   which the hammers strike the slugs in the print chain).  The
  1405		   same system programmers would also compete to see who could
  1406		   print a job that played specific (and known) tunes.
  1407	
  1408		One further story that comes to mind.  It is said that specific
  1409		models of IBM mainframes had a bug whereby "branching backwards
  1410		over a page boundary to a paged out page would leave the
  1411		supervisor bit turned on in the PSW in the stored PSW".  I never
  1412		was able to verify this but it makes some sort of sense when you
  1413		look at the hardware that IBM uses.

  1423		computer operator was obviously bored, he invited me into the
  1424		sanctum sanctorum - the computer room.  The computer was a CDC
  1425		3600 and had a curving console about 8 feet long with several
  1426		hundred lights and switches (in those days, there was no such
  1427		thing as terminal input).  On the far wall was a bank of a dozen
  1428		1/2" tape drives with vacuum column tape tension control.
  1429	
  1430		He loaded up a deck into the card reader (the only command input

  1432		PLAYED the Stars and Stripes Forever and assorted Sousa marches,
  1433		using the tones on the console (every light had its own tone)
  1434		for the high low notes and the tape drives for the low notes.
  1435		At the same time, all the lights on the console were blinking on
  1436		and off.  Since I am now a full-time programmer, I finally
  1437		appreciate the work it must have taken a system level programmer

  1462		the alphabet plus special characters.
  1463	
  1464		These chaps read the chain and created a file in their system
  1465		that had all of the characters of one pass in it.  They gave the
  1466		command to print the file.  Upon doing so the printer starts to
  1467		spin the chain, then SMACK!  Trying to print all of those
  1468		characters at once while the chain was moving, didn't quite

  1480		quantitative and with little background in statistics."  ( I
  1481		hope this is no longer true of MBA's.)
  1482	
  1483		Anyway, writing such an interface in FORTRAN IV was no picnic,
  1484		but I tried to make it very friendly.  Plain English questions,
  1485		examples of correct answers, range checks to determine validity

  1491		said "Five".  Puzzled, I asked if I could watch her run the

  1495		That's when I realized what nonquantitative really meant.  Even
  1496		though FORTRAN IV had no character string handling capability
  1497		(you had to declare your characters as INTEGER or REAL), I had

  1530		sitting beside one of the cabinets.  He said that the connection
  1531		between the chips' prongs and their sockets sometimes became
  1532		poor, and often when the system acted up the cure was to bang on
  1533		the cabinet with the mallet to reseat the chips.  He also said
  1534		anytime they had a photo of the lab taken, they made sure the

  1549		The particular hack that Mr.  Hinojosa and I described

  1652		...Seems I was a young hotshot programmer-type and was working
  1653		in the corporate research unit of a big company (lets see, it
  1654		makes LOTS of bandaids).  Well, it was the first time I ever
  1655		used a machine with a disk drive in a room that I could find
  1656		(much less have permission to enter).  Never having had a
  1657		computer with version numbers before (this was RSX-11M 3.0 --
  1658		dating myself huh?)  I never purged my directory.  Also given
  1659		that I was hacking an immense Data-entry and retrieval system in
  1660		Fortran-IV (more dating (-:  ), TKB would do intense things to
  1661		the drive, which was fragmented beyond belief.
  1662	
  1663		This tended to upset the system manager, one Mark Googleman, no

  1665		Since two hackers on one machine naturally tend to competition

  1673		taped papers to the floor with one's name on it in the computer

  1689	
  1690		The headline would be:  UNIX crashes IBM system.
  1691	
  1692		It seems that we had obtained an UNIX system and were using it
  1693		for the first time.  In those days UNIX was brand new and the
  1694		rest of the world had never heard of it.
  1695	
  1696		Any rate, we had attached our PDP-11/45 to an IBM 370-155 system
  1697		running JESS-2.  This meant the PDP-11 pretended to be a RJE
  1698		card-reader/printer/punch station.  Things were going quite well
  1699		and the Bell Labs software worked great.
  1700	
  1701		Then one day we found that our RJE line was disconnected and the
  1702		IBM people refused to allow us to talk with the IBM machines.
  1703		The reason, they claimed, was that most of the time that UNIX
  1704		submitted an RJE job the IBM would promptly crash with no error
  1705		report.
  1706	
  1707		Finally it was determined that when the IBM people had sysgen'd
  1708		the line they claimed it was a 2780 with a 80 character line and
  1709		we were a 2770 with a 132 character line.  This didn't cause
  1710		problems unless our line and the next adjacent line both
  1711		submitted jobs at once.
  1712	
  1713		But I thought it amusing that DEC equipment could crash an IBM
  1714		system at will.

  1726		it has a small man inside.
  1727	
  1728		While he was speaking, a CDC technician (the late Rachmim Moreno, a
  1729		small man indeed) had just finished some routine maintenance and
  1730		stepped out of the machine.
  1731	
  1732		Another story, which took place on April 1st 1984:
  1733	
  1734		I was requested to present Unix software tools to the Software
  1735		Workbench undergraduate course.  After talking about grep, SCCS,
  1736		lex and what not, I described an experimental expert system that
  1737		creates applications by combining UNIX tools.  Given an English
  1738		description of an application, the system produces user manuals.
  1739		Given an ``O.K.'', it would go on and produce the actual
  1740		software.
  1741	
  1742		The system was a success:  it kept some of the students busy for
  1743		a long time.  Here it is, reconstructed from memory:
  1744	
  1745		#!/bin/csh -f

  1747		echo "Type a short description followed by a control-D"

  1786		Date:  7 Feb 89
  1787	
  1788		There's another great story involving computers-that-have-
  1789		lights.  This one involves Ivan Sutherland, co-founder of Evans
  1790		& Sutherland (the pioneering computer-graphics firm), developer
  1791		of Sketchpad (the very first computer-graphics tablet device, I
  1792		believe), and winner of the "Father of Computer Graphics" aware
  1793		some years ago.
  1794	
  1795		While in college, Sutherland worked with one of the very
  1796		earliest Von Neumann architecture (stored-program) computers...
  1797		I've heard this specific machine referred to as "THE Von Neumann
  1798		machine".  This computer had a very limited amount of memory
  1799		storage.  Rather than using ferrite cores, RAM memory, or such
  1800		modern devices, it used "storage tubes"...  tiny little CRTs
  1801		similar in operation to the tubes used in some "storage screen"
  1802		graphics terminals (anybody used a Tektronix 4010 lately?).
  1803		These little devices would store a rectangular array of bits in
  1804		each tube.  It was actually possible to SEE the bits by looking
  1805		at the phosphor-coated target area in each screen.
  1806	
  1807		One of the disadvantages of this storage technology (aside from
  1808		low capacity) is that the tubes have a limited lifetime.
  1809		"Burn-in" eventually occurs (as owners of Tektronix storage
  1810		scopes can attest) as the phosphor structure ages and breaks
  1811		down, and eventually the tubes must be replaced.
  1812	
  1813		The engineers who maintained this computer had some
  1814		special-purpose diagnostic programs, which would run "ripple
  1815		patterns" through memory and would look for bit-patterns that
  1816		weren't stored properly (a similar test is done when diagnosing
  1817		memory problems in most computers).  With the Von Neumann
  1818		machine, though, it was often possible to identify tubes that
  1819		were on the way downhill, simply by looking at the array of
  1820		tubes in the cabinet and seeing which ones had a dim or uneven
  1821		appearance during the ripple test.
  1822	
  1823		One day, Sutherland [and a cohort, I believe] substituted a
  1824		program deck of their own devising for the memory-test deck that
  1825		the engineers used.  This substitute deck did not run the usual
  1826		memory test; instead, it loaded a certain specific bit-pattern
  1827		into memory and then halted the machine.
  1828	
  1829		During the next routine-maintenance period, the engineer reset
  1830		the machine, booted the deck, and the program immediately
  1831		halted.  Puzzled, the engineer reset and rebooted again, and the
  1832		same thing occurred.  Suspecting that some portion of memory had
  1833		failed so completely that the program could not run, the
  1834		engineer opened the panel to the storage-tube rack.
  1835	
  1836		There, shining out at him in carefully-lit bits, was a
  1837		four-letter word.
  1838	
  1839		A sign soon appeared in the computer room...  "Programmers will
  1840		NOT mess around with the hardware-diagnostic program decks!"
  1841

  1843		I've probably forgotten some of the details and have gotten
  1844		others wrong.]

  1857		Well, one day we received this big three foot square box from

  1859		could be sending us.  The person with the order said he had
  1860		asked for 30 lower case options.  The ADM3A terminal has an
  1861		upper and lower clamshell like case.  When the box was opened we
  1862		found they had sent us 30 lower halfs to the terminal case.

  1869		One time, in a college library, I ran across a book of computer
  1870		folklore.  It had a story about a young whiz kid hired as a
  1871		computer programmer, who didn't like the way that computer
  1872		operators were ordered to blindly follow directions.  So he took
  1873		a scratch removable disk pack apart, replaced the platters with
  1874		phonograph records, and put it back together.  Then, from his
  1875		terminal, he called for it to be mounted.  The operator could
  1876		tell that the disk pack was different (plastic is lighter than a
  1877		disk platter) but mounted it anyway, destroying a disk drive.
  1878	
  1879		In the late '60s, Georgia Tech went to a computer registration
  1880		system.  In Spring, 1969, George P.  Burdell (the mythical
  1881		Georgia Tech student created during the war years) was
  1882		registered for every class on campus.  I've heard that he aced
  1883		them all, too.
  1884	
  1885		Finally, in the early '70s, Georgia Tech installed a Univac
  1886		1108, so we heard all the Univac stories.  One of the stories
  1887		revolved around an operator, sitting sleepily at his computer
  1888		console about 2am, watching the backups.  The status messages
  1889		disappear from his screen, a large (CBS-style) eye appears on
  1890		the screen, it winks, and then the screen pops back to normal.
  1891		Those were the days of fast memory and memory mapped screens, so
  1892		its possible...
  1893	
  1894		Just one more.  On that same Univac, a friend discovered a
  1895		security hole.  It seems you could checkpoint (stop and save) a
  1896		job to tape to, say, shut the machine down for maintenance.  You
  1897		could later restart the job from the tape at the exact point you
  1898		stopped it.  My friend discovered that you could checkpoint the
  1899		job, change the privileged mode bit (guard mode, supervisor mode
  1900		etc.  -- the thing that prevented students from breaking into
  1901		the machine) to 1, and restart it -- as a privileged job.  He
  1902		was found out, though -- operators became suspicious when they
  1903		went from 0 checkpoints per month to several check-point tapes
  1904		per day.

  1930		displayed in fairly large incandescent bulbs on the front panel,
  1931		which needed high powered drivers.  Turning the bits on and off
  1932		made plenty of radio noise.  I've heard legends of PDP-9
  1933		programmers who would routinely leave a radio on the console as
  1934		a debugging aid.
  1935	
  1936		...There was a legendary card deck that, when run through an old
  1937		electromechanical accounting machine, would print out an
  1938		American flag while playing the Star Spangled Banner.
  1939	
  1940		Speaking of printers, here are two silly stories from about
  1941		1969.  At that time they used 360/20s as RJE terminals to the
  1942		360/91 mainframe.  The '91 crashed all the time, so while
  1943		waiting for the '91 to come back up we would toggle in little
  1944		programs from the console, or laboriously punch an up to 80 byte
  1945		program on a card, then use the "load" button to read and start
  1946		the program.  There was constant competition for the most
  1947		interesting single-card program.  My best was an expensive mimeo
  1948		machine that read in a deck of cards and listed it over and
  1949		over.
  1950	
  1951		In one case, we experimented with the Universal Character Set
  1952		buffer in the printer.  The 1403 printer had interchangeable
  1953		print trains, but different trains would have different
  1954		character layouts.  The UCS buffer told what character was at
  1955		what position on the train.  When it printed a line, it would
  1956		see what characters were at the right position, fire the
  1957		appropriate hammers, move the train ahead one position, fire the
  1958		appropriate hammers, and so on until the entire line was
  1959		printed.  So as an experiment, we filled the entire UCS buffer
  1960		with the same character, then printed lines of that character.
  1961		It printed about a page and a half real fast, then the cover
  1962		opened about half way (it automatically opened whenever the
  1963		printer ran out of paper, to warn the operator and dump
  1964		ever-present coffee cups on the floor) and then blew a fuse.  We
  1965		cleared out.  It hadn't occurred to us we could blow fuses with
  1966		software.
  1967	
  1968		In another case, we experimented with the carriage control tape.
  1969		Things like "skip to new page" or "vertical tab" were
  1970		implemented with a loop of paper tape that had 66 rows, one for
  1971		each line on a page, and 12 columns.  You could do a skip to
  1972		channel 1, and it would advance the paper and the tape until it
  1973		found a hole in column 1.  By convention, column 1 was top of
  1974		page, column 2 top and middle of page, but you could program it
  1975		any way you want.  We tried various combinations and everything
  1976		worked just fine until we tried a skip to channel 12.
  1977		Unfortunately, there weren't any punches in column 12, so the
  1978		paper just whizzed through the printer at full speed.  We pushed
  1979		the printer stop button.  Nothing.  We pushed the CPU stop
  1980		button.  Still nothing.  Finally the CPU System Reset button
  1981		stopped the printer.  Being good ecologists, we fed the paper
  1982		back into the feed box, then ran.

  2016		Yet another true IBM story:
  2017	
  2018		My girlfriend's father is a service tech for IBM.  He had one
  2019		computer that would periodically lock up for no apparent reason.
  2020		He tried replacing all sorts of boards, drives, and other
  2021		hardware to no avail.  Finally, he called in the specialists.
  2022	
  2023		The specialists arrived with many special tools, and in one case
  2024		a very special tool.  In an old style case, in a custom-molded
  2025		velour covered interior, sat the Vibra-matic -- a rubber mallet.
  2026		They had brought this as a joke, but....
  2027	
  2028		It turned out that the power supply wasn't completely welded to
  2029		the ground, and the vibration of the machine caused intermittent
  2030		power failures of extremely short duration.  This was fixed, and
  2031		tested with the specialists banging on the chassis with the
  2032		Vibra-matic while my girlfriend's father stuck his head inside
  2033		to look for vibration.  Luckily the owners of the machine never
  2034		saw them.

  2041		Heard recently from an IBM field service manager:
  2042	
  2043		A huge travel agency in Florida (a major booker of Caribbean
  2044		cruises for blue-haired retired ladies) recently bought an IBM
  2045		3090 to handle the reservation database.  When the deal was
  2046		consummated, the proud new owner asked IBM to install it in a
  2047		big glass room right behind the receptionist's area so all the
  2048		customers could see the flashing lights and spinning tape reels
  2049		as they walked in -- a testimony to the modernity of the agency.
  2050	
  2051		Good idea, except there are no blinking lights on a 3090.  So
  2052		the service manager offered to build some.  They hired a
  2053		theatrical designer to come up with a suitably futuristic "set",
  2054		got curved glass walls to minimize reflections, and installed
  2055		the mainframe behind the "real-looking" facade.  The customer
  2056		declared that it was exactly what he had in mind, regardless of
  2057		what the actual computer looks like.
  2058

  2066		(This is just a rumor, but it's a *neat* rumor....)
  2067	
  2068		It seems (allegedly) that certain Microsoft compilers are smart
  2069		enough to figure out when they are being benchmarked.  Any time
  2070		the parser sees the "standard" 10,000-prime-numbers algorithm,
  2071		it dumps that section of code and substitutes a set of
  2072		hand-tuned, gut-level machine code designed to do that one thing
  2073		as fast as possible!  I don't think it actually just printed
  2074		them out from a table, but you get the idea....
  2075	
  2076		Also:  (this is true)
  2077	
  2078		One has to be careful when trying to benchmark optimizing
  2079		compilers.  These things *are* smart enough to notice that while
  2080		you're doing all those expensive floating point calculations,
  2081		you're never actually doing anything with the answer...  so the
  2082		compiler just figures it all out once, and replaces all the
  2083		calculations with a simple assignment.
  2084	
  2085		Prime Computer once had a compiler optimize their competitor's
  2086		benchmark down to a single NOP -- and for several years they
  2087		gleefully used this "performance" figure in their ads.

  2092		Date:  9 Feb 89
  2093	
  2094		Back in the good ol' days of card readers, a game we discussed
  2095		was how to obtain passwords.  Jobs were submitted by setting
  2096		your deck of cards on a counter.  An operator would grab all the
  2097		jobs on the counter, run them through the reader, and return
  2098		them with their output later.
  2099	
  2100		We're talking CDC hardware here, so various combinations of
  2101		6-7-8-9 or 7-8-9 punches indicated End of Job, or End of Record.
  2102		Well, there was a magic combination (6-8-9?)  that was
  2103		interpreted as "read binary, and ignore other control punches
  2104		except the magic combination."
  2105	
  2106		So, the devious programmer submits two jobs, the first has a
  2107		program to read binary data, followed by a 6-8-9 and (for the
  2108		operator's consumption only) a 6-7-8-9.  The second job just has
  2109		a 6-8-9 to switch the system out of binary mode.  The two jobs
  2110		are placed on the counter is such a way that the first job will
  2111		be the first one through the card reader and the second job will
  2112		be the last one through the card reader, with other students
  2113		jobs in between.  Viola', you've got a whole list of accounts
  2114		and passwords.
  2115	
  2116		Of course, the operator might become suspicious when 10 jobs go
  2117		in and only one comes out.  Or, he might scramble the order of
  2118		the jobs left on the counter defeating the plan.  I'm not sure
  2119		anybody actually did this, but it strikes me as an easy way to
  2120		breach security.

  2124		Subject:  Operating system comments
  2125		Date:  9 Feb 89
  2126	
  2127		Another subclass of computer folklore is the occasional barbed
  2128		comment that one can find when reading through source code.
  2129		Operating-system programmers seem particularly prone to witty,
  2130		shamefaced, or other slightly-off-center comments in their code.
  2131	
  2132		Some examples come to mind (some of the details may be
  2133		incorrect; it's been a long time since I read any of this code):
  2134	
  2135		1) DEC RSX-11M (???)  operating system.  System fault handler
  2136		   module.  If a bus-check fault occurs (indicating possible
  2137		   hardware problems with some device on the bus), the O/S traps
  2138		   to a fault-handler routine that tries to identify the
  2139		   offending hardware and reset it.  If, while attempting to
  2140		   recover from a bus-check fault, a second such fault occurs,
  2141		   the system traps again...  this time to a routine which
  2142		   simply masks off all processor interrupts and hangs in a
  2143		   tight loop.  It's necessary to manually reset the machine to
  2144		   unhang it.
  2145	
  2146		   The comment on the loop reads, "The death of God left the
  2147		   angels in a strange position."
  2148	
  2149		2) There are a couple of comments in the output-symbiont (print
  2150		   spooler) code in the old Xerox CP-V operating system.  At the
  2151		   top of a long block of convoluted and otherwise undocumented
  2152		   code, there appears a taunting:
  2153	
  2154			"See if you can figure out what I'm doing here."
  2155	
  2156		   Somewhat further on, there's a really dubious code-construct
  2157		   (I don't recall just what was being done), adorned with the
  2158		   comment:
  2159	
  2160			"I'm ashamed of this"
  2161	
  2162		3) In the synchronous-terminal (BISYNC) module in the CP-6
  2163		   operating system's communications software, there's a routine
  2164		   that constructs synchronous data blocks (the ones that start
  2165		   out with the characters "syn, syn, dle", and so forth).  The
  2166		   code comment reads
  2167	
  2168			"With a SYNC SYNC here...
  2169			 and a SYNC SYNC there..."
  2170	
  2171		   The module is labeled "EIE_IO".
  2172	
  2173		4) A related module, which was responsible for driving the Unit
  2174		   Record Peripheral printer, was labeled "Y@URP".

  2179		Date:  8 Feb 89
  2180	
  2181		At Carnegie-Mellon, the standard carriage tape had an empty
  2182		channel.  An easy way to get on the bad side of the operators
  2183		was to use the right character as a FORTRAN print control
  2184		character.  (The tape was designed so that the printer
  2185		implemented nearly all of the FORTRAN carriage control
  2186		features.)  It was never a problem until someone wrote a SNOBOL
  2187		program and forgot to print a space at the beginning of each
  2188		line.  The operator wasn't near the machine at the time and 1403
  2189		fed the paper faster than it could stack!
  2190	
  2191		...I hereby claim the best sound of any printer music.  At
  2192		Sanders Technology, a defunct company that pioneered the letter
  2193		quality dot matrix printer, I decided to come up with some real
  2194		music.
  2195	
  2196		After a disappointing start, I designed some fonts that were
  2197		variable numbers of vertical bars in 1/2 inch wide characters.
  2198		The printer's horizontal resolution was 0.001", better than
  2199		laser printers, but not good enough for decent music.  I had to
  2200		compute line spacings in 0.0001" units and round to the nearest
  2201		0.001".  About an octave and a half would fit in a 2Kb PROM
  2202		(this was before 16K ram chips made down-loaded fonts
  2203		practical).
  2204	
  2205		Next I arranged "A Bicycle Built for Two", since that was the
  2206		first song a computer ever played (you've heard it in the movie
  2207		2001).  It also was a hack on Daisywheel terminals, our main
  2208		competition.  It was impressive.  And attracted a fair amount of
  2209		attention at the trade shows.
  2210	
  2211		I later did three Christmas carols, and even a version of Le
  2212		Marseilles (sp?)  for a potential French customer.
  2213	
  2214		Since the only real language we had was Fortran, I wrote TECO
  2215		programs to generate the font from a source file of frequency
  2216		and character bindings, and another TECO program that read a
  2217		simple music language and generated the lines of text needed to
  2218		play the song.  Not only could I set the meter, the program had
  2219		to reverse the order of the characters for the right-left
  2220		passes.
  2221	
  2222		I still have two of those printers.  NH Mensa prints its
  2223		newsletters on one.  Unfortunately, I'm running out of ribbons
  2224		and the pins are beginning to crack.  Smart printer.  Does its
  2225		own justification, handles proportional fonts, mixed fonts, all
  2226		sorts of stuff.  Its control language is readable, inspired by
  2227		runoff.  Between the printer, a CP/M system and a screen editor
  2228		(written as a macro for a TECO variant), who needs an IBM PC?

  2353		When the Viking Mars probes where launched, no one thought

  2459		I had gotten a program from a friend that delivered a random
  2460		message from a file.  These messages tended to be ridiculous or
  2461		to make fun of computers we were using.  The Gould S.E.L we had
  2462		just gotten in had a (deservedly, IMO) reputation for being all
  2463		screwed up.  So I put messages in the file such as:
  2464	
  2465		MPX/32 NOT FOUND. ENTER OPERATING SYSTEM IN HEX ON CONSOLE.
  2466	
  2467		and set up the system-wide login procedure to execute the
  2468		"fortunes" program when anyone logged in.  Unfortunately, I was
  2469		late the next morning, and it seems a new guy (who had always
  2470		been protected from "this JCL stuff" before) had logged in,
  2471		gotten the above message, and spent 1/2 hour looking through the
  2472		documentation for the hex code for the O.S.
  2473	
  2474		When I got in, each time I tried to login (on 4 separate

  2522	
  2523		Actually, the print chains are not in alphabetical order.  They
  2524		are magically ordered by some arcane formula.  Some of the
  2525		printers are designed so that the hammer will strike the
  2526		character just as the correct character is at the correct place
  2527		in the line (the chain rotates at very fast speeds).  Often,
  2528		many characters will get printed at the same time, and no more
  2529		than 2 rotations of the chain are ever needed to print a line
  2530		(which is why they are fast).  Presumably, the right set of
  2531		characters on a line will cause all the hammers (132) to strike
  2532		at the same time (while the chain is rotating).
  2533	
  2534		I had related a story like this to a friend in college and
  2535		(unknown to me) had decided to try it.  He spent a night
  2536		carefully going over the chain and determining the proper
  2537		sequence to send.  The next evening, he decided to print his
  2538		file, and had me watch (only one line was printed).  The job
  2539		printed and we ran downstairs.  The printer was still rocking
  2540		slightly.  Opening up the cover, the chain was still intact, but
  2541		had come completely off the drive that held it.  We tore out the
  2542		offending sheet of paper with the incriminating line (smudged
  2543		and garbled) and complained to the operator on duty that the
  2544		printer was broken again.  I don't think my friend ever tried it

  2551	
  2552		...A few years ago I worked for a *VERY* small company called
  2553		Metalsoft which made software for sheet-metal punch machines.
  2554		Prior to my joining the company, the software department
  2555		consisted of one person (my boss), Voldi Way, who was 15 years
  2556		old.  The only product we had then was a NC program editor which
  2557		Voldi wrote in BASIC to run on an IBM PC (it actually was pretty
  2558		nice for the price in spite of all this).
  2559	
  2560		I was there to help design a full CAD/CAM system to
  2561		automatically write NC programs, but I still had to help support
  2562		the old program.  Voldi put a few "undocumented features" in
  2563		this program which he never told anyone about, including the
  2564		president of the company (well...  I knew, but *I* wasn't going
  2565		to say anything).
  2566	
  2567		In any case, one morning someone at a sheet metal shop far away
  2568		(I think Atlanta), called a file f*ckoff or some such thing and
  2569		the editor responded with, "My, are we having a bad day?  You
  2570		really should try to relax more," or something like that.  The
  2571		NC-programmer then called the president of our company (Carl)
  2572		and said he had cussed at the computer and it had *answered*
  2573		him!  Carl said, "No it didn't," and claimed over and over again
  2574		that it couldn't do that.
  2575	
  2576		After he got off the phone he came into our office and started
  2577		asking questions at which time Voldi and I both began laughing
  2578		hysterically.  It took dozens of users about 8 months to notice
  2579		this "feature", which had around 100 words that it recognized,
  2580		and a few dozen responses including some that made the computer
  2581		unusable for 10 to 15 minutes (like telling the user that it was
  2582		formatting the hard disk).  Needless to say, the feature
  2583		disappeared in the next release.

  2606		stop by the coffee machine on his way into the computer room and
  2607		walk in with his cup in one hand, his cigarette in the other.
  2608		On several occasions he was observed to place his cigarette

  2779		and 2000 systems.  For those who have never owned one of these
  2780		cuties, they were designed in 1959 (I think) and were
  2781		constructed of discrete transistors, as ICs hadn't been invented
  2782		yet.  We're talking room size machines.
  2783	
  2784		The tape drives were a mix of transistors and vacuum tubes
  2785		(6AU6's, 12AU7's on the picker cleat driver, 807's in the servo
  2786		amps, I think).  Since the tubes needed a warm up period and the
  2787		transistors didn't, the tape drive power supplies had a
  2788		complicated startup sequence using some largish relays.
  2789	
  2790		One day, I got a call about a tape drive (transport in those
  2791		days) that was acting very bizarre.  As soon as they hit the on
  2792		switch, the tape reels would take off in opposite directions and
  2793		stretch the 1" tape down to a little thread about 1/16" in
  2794		diameter before it broke.  (The motors were slightly larger than
  2795		a car's starter - no joke)
  2796	
  2797		As I entered the computer room, I was met with several high
  2798		ranking types scratching heads.  I listened to the complaints,
  2799		watched the transport go crazy for a bit, and went to work.
  2800		Without saying a single word, I shut the machine off and hit the
  2801		left side of the power control panel (directly over the power-on
  2802		sequence relay) with my fist.  I re-loaded a tape, turned on the
  2803		power and watched everything come up OK.  I turned and left,
  2804		still without a word.
  2805

  2826		When mailing labels were printed, both the key value and a
  2827		special code used by the mailing machines was required on the
  2828		top line of the label.  We ran out of space on the label.
  2829

  2834		all of the letters and digits!
  2835

  2860		which performed a table lookup of every word which a committee
  2861		of about a dozen of the raunchiest people in the department
  2862		could come up with.  But what about short phrases?  And how
  2863		about maintenance of the table?  Whose budget does this come out

  2876		...This posting brought back to mind my experiences with an SDS
  2877		machine one summer at a NASA base I worked at.  I believe the
  2878		machine was an SDS 930, but I may be mistaken.
  2879	
  2880		It did not like to have its main memory cabinet door closed
  2881		(crashing after a few moments if anyone had the timerity to
  2882		close it!), so it always sat there with one door partly open.
  2883	
  2884		It had a card reader that was interesting.  It read the cards
  2885		length-wise (column 1->80) rather than width-wise (row 9->12).
  2886		So, if the cards were a little out of spec (low bidder on a
  2887		government contract), it would either read two cards at a time,
  2888		or eat one card at a time.  When one was eaten you could recover
  2889		it from inside the reader -- neatly folded into a many-creased
  2890		accordian that was cute to look at but impossible to read.
  2891	
  2892		The previous poster also mentioned that their machine did not
  2893		like to awaken in the morning.  Here at the Indian Hill location
  2894		of Bell Labs we had one machine that did not mind awakening, as
  2895		long as it was not Monday.  It hated Monday mornings.  It was
  2896		one half of a duplex pair of IBM 360/67's.  Each Monday the
  2897		machines would be IPLed and each Monday the Left Half would come
  2898		up all ready to work, while the Right Half balked and struggled
  2899		and refused to come up for at least another hour.  The Comp
  2900		Center staff tried all kinds of things to try to cure or get
  2901		around the problem (let it run all weekend, lie to it and tell
  2902		it that Monday was Tuesday, etc.), but it had that habit as long
  2903		as I can remember working on it.

  2922		On another level of computing, a couple of years ago I designed
  2923		and built a board for my S-100 system that would treat
  2924		Colecovision game cartridges as if they were mapped input
  2925		devices.  This way I was able to read the object code onto disk
  2926		and eventually into memory.  I would then dis-assemble the
  2927		program to find out how they worked.  I don't recall which game
  2928		it was, but near the end of the code was the text reading
  2929		something to the effect of:
  2930	
  2931		"If someone at Atari is reading this, please say hello to Jim
  2932		Pym."
  2933	
  2934		The name is made up, but you get the point.  Similarly, you
  2935		could find some names scattered in the code that never showed up
  2936		in the game itself, and I seem to recall (though I'd have to go
  2937		back and check) someone actually including a love note in the
  2938		code as a dedication.

  2948		A computer repairman was one day called to a grade school to

  2952		boards, housing walls, etc.  He had never seen any coating like
  2953		this in any other computer.  The repair of the processor
  2954		involved simply blowing out the dust.
  2955	
  2956		A few days later he was on another service call within the
  2957		school for another computer.  Walking by the room that contained
  2958		the unit he had previously fixed, he decided to peek into the
  2959		room to see how it was doing.  What he saw explained the white
  2960		dust.  He saw several boys beating the chalk board erasers next

  2986		...Here's a folk tale.  The person who told me says he was
  2987		there, and I believe him.
  2988	
  2989		Several/many years ago, when Tops-10 was the most exciting
  2990		operating system at DEC (that is, before Tops-20), and when
  2991		ANF-10 was considered networking (hmmm...  I guess it still
  2992		would be), some interesting hacks were perpetrated.  My favorite
  2993		two stories:
  2994	
  2995		The ANF-10 nodes were PDP-11's, some serving as terminal
  2996		concentrators, some as front-ends to the 10's.  A person made
  2997		some modifications to the code to run in the terminal
  2998		concentrator version so that, if you asked to be connected to a
  2999		node that wasn't currently available, it would respond "That
  3000		node is not available.  Would you care to play Adventure while
  3001		you wait?", and was in fact prepared to play adventure if
  3002		requested.
  3003	
  3004		The "reverse video" hack:  this was done "to" a particular
  3005		person that people didn't much like.  The terminal concentrator
  3006		code was changed to make his terminal work backwards.  "Home"
  3007		was the bottom right corner.  Carriage return returned you to
  3008		the rightmost column.  Line feed moved you up a line.  And so
  3009		forth.  The terminal escape sequences were parsed, interpreted,
  3010		and reissued suitably modified.
  3011	
  3012		I probably once knew who the perpetrators (and victims) were,
  3013		but it's all lost in the mists of time for me now.  Sorry for
  3014		not giving proper credit.

  3024		While working as a lab consultant, he was approached by a woman
  3025		(a business major) who was having problems with an IBM PC drive.
  3026		So he goes over to the machine to examine it.  It seems that the
  3027		drive performed correctly, but took ten times longer than usual
  3028		to retrieve the proper information.  Upon examination of the
  3029		drive itself, he noticed TWO diskettes had been shoved into the
  3030		drive (which happens to be a difficult feat).  Her explanation?
  3031		"I thought it would double the capacity."
  3032	
  3033		He also told me about the time someone put a 3.5" disk into a
  3034		5.25" drive...  They had to take the machine apart to retrieve
  3035		the broken pieces.

  3048		up a photocopy of the tape (rather than a magnetic copy).
  3049	
  3050		We all got a laugh out of it.  To make things even better, the

  3059	
  3060		During the 1970's my organization used quite a bit of punched
  3061		tape.  In fact, in a storeroom there are still about a dozen
  3062		VERY expensive rolls of unused metallized mylar punched tape
  3063		which we used for creation of, ahem, archive tape records.  The
  3064		definition of "archive" media sure has changed, huh?
  3065	
  3066		We still have a thermal punched tape splicer, along with a rack
  3067		that has a high-speed Remex tape reader and punch.  None of this
  3068		stuff has seen use in at least five years, but I have not had
  3069		the heart to order its disposal.
  3070	
  3071		I did, however, concede to changing times, and junked our
  3072		Decision Data 8020 interpreting card reader/punch about 4 years
  3073		ago when we axed an PDP-11/44.  I remember when that card
  3074		reader-punch was ordered in 1974 at a cost of around $8K.  It
  3075		was our only card device which was shared among development
  3076		systems when necessary.  We even designed a custom interface
  3077		using an 8080 with software driver so that it could run on
  3078		either an 11/03 QBUS or on UNIBUS.  We wanted interpreting
  3079		capability, in addition to having a standalone keypunch (which
  3080		the 8020 would also do), so we never bought any native DEC card
  3081		equipment.
  3082	
  3083		In one lab where we had two ASR-33's, which have now been gone
  3084		for several years, a piece of oiled punched paper chad will
  3085		STILL worm its way out of the baseboard moulding every once and
  3086		a while.  Unfortunately, more than one chad box was accidentally
  3087		dumped -- so the floor has been well "seeded" over the years.

  3096	
  3097		He tried out his Macintosh MIDI equipment, and everything worked
  3098		perfectly.  In those days, in the early mid-eighties, one had to
  3099		rely on 512K, and an external disk drive (no hard drive).
  3100	
  3101		Then he went up to Chicago (?)  for a performance for an
  3102		audience.  He picked up all the equipment on the stage -- it
  3103		didn't work at all.
  3104	
  3105		So the next couple of hours he tried to figure out what is
  3106		wrong, and the audience started to show up...
  3107	
  3108		But then, Aha!, somebody discovered that the external disk drive
  3109		was placed on the left side of the Macintosh -- not on the right
  3110		side, as it should according to the manual.  The Mac has its
  3111		transformers on the left side, and their magnetic field
  3112		interfered with the drive.
  3113	
  3114		So they moved the drive over to the right side, everything all
  3115		of a sudden working perfectly, and the performance was carried
  3116		in land.

  3126	
  3127		There was a large Univac installation there, and some
  3128		ultra-high-speed card readers.  He hollowed out an entire box of
  3129		punch cards (about 2.5 feet of cards, for all you youngsters)
  3130		and filled them with old old old bananas.  He then submitted
  3131		this deck as a job.  The operators were used to multi-box jobs,
  3132		so they usually just picked up the entire box of cards and
  3133		dumped them in the high-speed readers.  It took over 3 weeks of
  3134		maintenance before the reader was working reliably again, and
  3135		the control room reeked of banana for weeks afterwards...
  3136	
  3137		When crucial data on tape was lost at my university, the gurus
  3138		in the computer room would retrieve as much data as possible,
  3139		then fill in the gaps by soaking the tapes in a solution that
  3140		made the individual bits show up as 1 or 0 (dark or light) under
  3141		a magnifier.  They'd then hand-assemble the missing sections
  3142		from the visual inspection.
  3143	
  3144		I once spent an entire night (over 12 hours) trying to get my
  3145		compiler (working up to that point) to work again so I could
  3146		work on it some more for my compilers course.  At the end, I had
  3147		reduced the problem down to a program (C code) that basically
  3148		declared an integer "i", said "i=5", then printed "i".  The
  3149		program printed a floating-point number...  I was so angry I got
  3150		the idiot who had been mucking around with the C compiler from
  3151		Bell Labs in the lab at 7am on Sunday morning to fix the damned
  3152		thing.

  3154		Our aged PDP-10 finally died one weekend when we had an
  3155		unusually hot Sunday (there was no operator support on Sundays
  3156		until 6pm) and it turned out the fall leaves had never been
  3157		cleared from the AC vents by the university physical plant.  The
  3158		temperature got over 100 degrees F in the computer room, and the
  3159		old CPU on the 10 wouldn't even whimper afterwards.

  3171		copy of my disk as per your request," only to find a photocopy
  3172		attached to the letter.  They did copy both sides, at least.
  3173	
  3174		This is the same company (my wife worked there) where an irate
  3175		customer couldn't save his records to disk.  The error message
  3176		he reported would only have appeared on a full disk, but he
  3177		claimed that he checked the space remaining and it was "okay".
  3178		Turns out that the program he ran to check remaining space on a
  3179		disk drive returned the amount of free space, expressed in
  3180		Kbytes.  A full disk, therefore, returned the string 0k (where 0
  3181		= zero).
  3182	
  3183		Then there was the customer who complained because the new
  3184		software release wouldn't print.  This customer just *knew* he'd
  3185		caught the software company in a bug and he was demanding his
  3186		money back.  My wife stepped through the whole process, set up a

  3188		amount of time duplicating his situation.  At last she
  3189		determined that the only possible failure was that his printer
  3190		wasn't on line.

  3304	
  3305		In the early 1970's at Georgia Tech there lived a Univac 1108
  3306		running under the Exec 8 operating system.  The 1108 had
  3307		commands that began with an @, and they would hang up the
  3308		terminal until you were done.  So, for example, an:
  3309	
  3310			@MSG,W Operator, please mount tape 1234...
  3311	
  3312		would send a message to the operator, but wouldn't return
  3313		control to your terminal until the operator replied.  Anyway,
  3314		some fellow at Univac got the idea of double-@ commands, which
  3315		would allow you to play through while the single @ commands were
  3316		working -- kind of like the & feature of Unix.
  3317	
  3318			@@MSG,W Operator...

  3320		would allow you to go on, but required the operator to answer a
  3321		console question.  After our "new" OS was installed, the Rich
  3322		Electronic Computer Center published a bulletin about how to use
  3323		this new feature.  Soon afterwards, a student filled a file with
  3324		4K of these operator reply statements and started it...
  3325	
  3326		Results -- the operator's console was flooded with messages, all
  3327		of which required a reply.  He had to bring the machine down,
  3328		dump the memory, and reboot.  The next morning, the system staff
  3329		went through the dump and removed the student's login from the
  3330		system.

  3338	
  3339		I worked as a student "computer consultant" for Austin College
  3340		(no, not UT) during my undergrad years.  One Saturday the entire
  3341		Organic Chem class was in trying to do some simulated analysis
  3342		of compounds.  A (minor) friend and (major) crush of mine walked
  3343		in to find all the terminals in use, so I took her down to the
  3344		machine room to allow her to use one of the terminals there.
  3345	
  3346		I think the terminal was an ADM-something with a detached
  3347		keyboard.  At any rate, the keyboard started acting up, causing
  3348		the program to simulate all sorts of tests she didn't want.
  3349		After jiggling the cord several times, which fixed the problem
  3350		for about 1.5 minutes each, I finally stated that it needed
  3351		"manual adjustment", picked the keyboard up, lowered it a
  3352		carefully eyed 2 inches, and dropped it to the desktop.
  3353	
  3354		It worked fine for the next 4 hours until I left.  She looked at

  3365		taken by mail) a few years ago, there were a few campers that
  3366		would choose only one program.  One girl "Natasha" was extremely
  3367		interested in the high wire, and deathly afraid of the computer
  3368		rooms.  Room 1 was around 25 PC's, Room 2 was //e's, and Room 3
  3369		was a bunch of Mac 128's...  (That was HIGH tech then....)

  3374		like the surface of the pool, and the trapeze is spewing debris

  3376		to be indoors, and after MUCH coaxing, we get Natasha to draw a
  3377		picture on the "cute little harmless computer"...

  3381		the "A" symbol means letters, and she's going to title her
  3382		creation...  All of a sudden there is a HUGE CRASH -- lightening
  3383		strikes the transformers outside...  As she touches it, the
  3384		keyboard starts smoking, and the image of her picture melts down

  3386		This poor girl was so traumatized that she'll NEVER touch a Mac

  3389		By the way, the lightbulbs overhead exploded, the //e
  3390		motherboards were OK, but their power supplys were black inside,
  3391		and smelled like a campfire...  they all had to be replaced.
  3392		Half/2 the Macs were wrecked violently -- smoking keyboards,
  3393		etc...  the other half just needed new fuses...  And the grand
  3394		finale -- the IBM's were a total loss, and some of the IBM color
  3395		monitors had flames coming out of the top...
  3396	
  3397		I was told Natasha ran so far it took a half hour to catch
  3398		her...  As I remember it, I got a fire extinguisher, and was
  3399		having a blast dousing the IBM's...  However, knowing
  3400		"selective" memory being what it is, I was probably crouching

  3488		prior day's business to prove the the system was ready for
  3489		production.
  3490	
  3491		Until about 10 years ago, we would do this by copying all the

  3529		feet in diameter (I have difficulty believing this).  He claimed

  3531		sufficient to warp the ship's decks as the ship rocked and
  3532		heaved while underway.
  3533	
  3534		A first-hand story:  this one actually happened to me.  When I
  3535		was a student at the University of Texas, I was employed at a
  3536		computer lab programming one of the early generation desktop
  3537		computers.  The machine was an 8080 (later Z80) CP/M machine
  3538		with an S-100 bus in an IMSIA (sp?)  cabinet.  The IMSIA cabinet
  3539		was about the size of a modern IBM-PC but about twice as high.
  3540		The chassis was aluminum with a steel cover.  The power cord for
  3541		the system entered the cabinet through the rear and was
  3542		connected directly to a terminal strip (two parallel rows of
  3543		screws in a heavy piece of bakelite).  The terminal strip was
  3544		mounted on the backplane of the cabinet which was a sheet of
  3545		aluminum about 1/8" thick.
  3546	
  3547		Well one day I was merrily typing away on a terminal when an
  3548		hair-raising event occurred.  A jet of fire and sparks spewed
  3549		out of the rear of the computer cabinet accompanied by brilliant
  3550		ultraviolet light.  It was as though someone had started up an
  3551		arc welder inside the computer.  The lab filled with ozone and
  3552		smoke.  The welding continued for about a two full seconds
  3553		before it ceased of its own accord.  It took a couple of minutes
  3554		to get my heart out of my throat and get up the nerve to unplug
  3555		the machine.  When I examined the computer I found a 3/8" hole
  3556		in the aluminum backplane of the computer which had obviously
  3557		been torched out.  The desk was covered with molten globules of
  3558		aluminum which hardened into little pills.
  3559	
  3560		The computer lab was in a building filled with engineering labs
  3561		which contained all kinds of heavy equipment.  Apparently one or
  3562		more large machines had been switched on or off and a hell of a
  3563		big power spike had come down the line.  Evidently one of the
  3564		screws in the computer's terminal strip was just a little bit
  3565		too long and the tip of the screw was just a little bit too
  3566		close to the aluminum backplane of the cabinet which was
  3567		grounded of course.  This closeness allowed the power spike to
  3568		arc between the tip of the screw and the backplane.  The arc
  3569		continued until the hole it was melting in the backplane grew
  3570		too large to sustain the arc.
  3571	
  3572		The amazing part of this story was that the computer was
  3573		completely unharmed save some cosmetic damage.  Even the fuses
  3574		were intact (they were "downstream" from the terminal strip).
  3575		Furthermore, the building fuse hadn't blown.  Basically, after
  3576		about ten minutes to get my nerve back, I plugged the computer
  3577		back in, cleaned the aluminum pills off my desk, and went back
  3578		to work like nothing had happened.  Try that with your Taiwan
  3579		clone!  (Later on I trimmed down all the screws in the power
  3580		strip.)

  3673		"You said in your beginners column of <month/year forgotten>
  3674		that nothing I could enter at the keyboard would harm my
  3675		computer at all.
  3676	
  3677		"Well, I entered a Coke at the keyboard, and believe me it did
  3678		some kind of damage."

  3685		DISCLAIMER:  So help me God, this is the absolute truth.  I
  3686		should know, because I was there.
  3687	
  3688		Many moons ago (1982), I was on contract as a P/A to one of
  3689		those credit card companies that shall remain nameless.  I was
  3690		attached to the project that was completely rewriting the
  3691		billing process.  The approved implementation included a massive
  3692		number of database tables that the Credit Department would
  3693		maintain to control their billing cycles, appearance of the
  3694		statement for different types of customers, interest charge
  3695		calculation, and so on, ad nauseum.
  3696	
  3697		Well, as the project trundled on toward completion, the end user
  3698		became aware of the manpower effort that would be required to
  3699		initialize all of these tables.  (In retrospect, their reaction
  3700		was really quite excessive.)  Our illustrious Project Manager
  3701		said at the time, "No problem.  We'll just promote the TestBed
  3702		environment."  I'm sure that you can imagine our reaction, as
  3703		the mischievous minds of programmers tend to generate humorous
  3704		testing environments.
  3705	
  3706		Sure enough, despite all of the programmers's and testers's
  3707		objections, the TestBed environment was promoted to Production
  3708		"...with those changes that are deemed necessary by the Credit
  3709		Department."  Apparently, they did not catch all of the
  3710		"necessary changes" because in the first week, the Credit
  3711		Department mailed 1,500 statements to delinquent customers with
  3712		the Reminder Notice:  "Pay up, or we'll rape your wife."
  3713	
  3714		Judging by the memo that was distributed to the MIS Department
  3715		following this debacle, the rest of the organization failed to
  3716		see the humor in this.

  3723		This reminds me of a particularly nasty trick we (myself and a
  3724		fellow named Mike something) played in High School (1972?).  In
  3725		our FORTRAN course all of the students's card decks were packed
  3726		in boxes and shipped out to run at some magic computer elsewhere
  3727		in the city; turnaround was about 2 days.  Well, Mike was
  3728		somewhat of a system hack and had "discovered" that there was a
  3729		way to read all other JCL (yep, IBM) in a deck as data.  We just
  3730		had to try it out.
  3731	
  3732		I wrote a super simple parser (scan a line for READ, WRITE,
  3733		DO...)  and an output formatter which did a fair job of
  3734		duplicating the real compiler's output.  We just slipped the
  3735		"special" JCL in at the start of the deck and viola...  the
  3736		students received realistic looking compiles but with fake error
  3737		messages like, "READ statement in wrong place" or, "You cannot
  3738		WRITE here".  Well, the instructor just didn't know what to make
  3739		of this (he was new to this stuff too) and we finally had to
  3740		'fess up.  As I remember it I got one of my very few detentions
  3741		for costing the class a whole computer run but it was worth it
  3742		to see the teacher's face.
