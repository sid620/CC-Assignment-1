     1	BATON ROUGE, La., February 4, 1992 -- Fifth Generation Systems today
     2	announced the release of FastBack Plus Windows and FastBack Plus Network,
     3	the latest additions to its industry-standard FastBack Plus high-speed
     4	backup product line.
     5	
     6	"Our goal is to provide users across multiple platforms the same
     7	reliability and ease of use associated with FastBack for DOS," said Barry
     8	L. Bellue, president and chief executive officer of Fifth Generation
     9	Systems. "With our Windows and network additions, we've taken the
    10	market-leading backup utility and made it faster and easier to use in any
    11	operating environment: DOS, Windows, Macintosh and a variety of common
    12	network operating systems." FastBack Windows
    13	
    14	FastBack Plus Windows Version 1.0 runs under Microsoft Windows version 3.0
    15	or higher, allowing the user to back up files on hard disk(s) in the
    16	background while other Windows applications are being run.
    17	
    18	"A user can begin a backup using FastBack Plus Windows, minimize the
    19	window, and then proceed to work on other tasks such as spreadsheets or
    20	word processing applications," said Sandra Lyle, FastBack Plus product
    21	marketing manager. "Users will only notice FastBack Plus Windows'
    22	non-obtrusive operation when they are prompted to insert additional disks
    23	for the backup."
    24	
    25	"This is the fastest Windows-based backup utility available today," said
    26	Ryc Brownrigg, director of product development. "Rather than porting our
    27	product to Windows, we've developed FastBack Plus Windows to operate as
    28	fast in Windows' multitasking mode as it does in a dedicated DOS system."
    29	
    30	Besides the technical superiority of the product, FastBack Plus Windows has
    31	been aesthetically designed to take full advantage of Windows' visual user
    32	interface.
    33	
    34	"The developers have done a great job creating graphics that are true
    35	visual representations of each feature. The icons are exceptionally
    36	well-conceived and allow even the most inexperienced user to rapidly make
    37	the transition from the simple Express Menu to the more complex backup
    38	functions," Lyle said.
    39	
    40	Other features of FastBack Plus Windows include:
    41	
    42	o EXPRESS MENU -- Easy-to-use, one-step process for quickly backing up
    43	files and programs.
    44	
    45	o QUICK TAG -- Mouse-based pointer for selecting files and directories to
    46	backup.
    47	
    48	o AUTO-FORMAT -- Disks or tapes do not need to be formatted prior to
    49	backup.
    50	
    51	o ADAPTIVE DATA COMPRESSION -- Compresses data 20 to 80 percent, depending
    52	on the file type and compression method, greatly reducing the number of
    53	backup data disks required.
    54	
    55	o ALTERNATE DEVICES -- Allows backing up of files to more than one disk
    56	drive, if available, greatly reducing total backup time since disks can be
    57	replaced on one drive while the other is receiving the data from the
    58	backup files.
    59	
    60	o FILE ENCRYPTION -- Data can be encrypted at various levels, including
    61	government-approved DES, to assure data integrity and security.
    62	
    63	o INTER-PLATFORM COMPATIBILITY -- Files backed up under Windows can be
    64	restored on a Macintosh or DOS system; files backed up under DOS or
    65	Macintosh can be restored under Windows.
    66	
    67	o ADVANCED ERROR CORRECTION -- Recovers data from heavily damaged backup
    68	diskettes. 
    69	
    70	o ON-LINE HELP -- Complete on-line help functions.
    71	
    72	o MULTIPLE DEVICE COMPATIBLE -- Ability to backup to any DOS device,
    73	including removable hard drives, Bernoulli cartridges and optical media.
    74	
    75	FastBack Plus Windows is available at a suggested retail price of $189.
    76	Site licenses are also available. FastBack Plus Windows for systems
    77	running Microsoft Windows 3.0 or higher will be available through the
    78	dealers on February 19.
    79	
    80	FastBack Plus Network 
    81	
    82	FastBack Plus Network, Version 1.0, facilitates automated backup of the
    83	network server to large-capacity SCSI (Small Computer Systems Interface)
    84	drives at any scheduled time. This enables backup when the server is not
    85	being used by other systems on the network. Fastback Plus Network has all
    86	of the features of FastBack Plus Windows, except for the graphical Windows
    87	interface and background processing capabilities, and works on Novell
    88	Netware, Banyan Vines or any other PC-based network operating system.
    89	FastBack Plus Network is available at a suggested retail price of $225.
    90	The product is currently shipping. Like all products from Fifth Generation
    91	Systems, FastBack Plus Windows and FastBack Plus Network are backed by the
