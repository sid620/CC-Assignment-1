     7	================================================================
     8	
     9	     The Ven-Tel 9600 Plus External Modem provides secure, high
    10	speed communications over both dial-up and leased lines.
    11	Designed according to the CCITT V.32 specifications, it supports
    12	MNP Levels 2, 3, and 4 and is compliant with the internationsl
    13	error correction standard v.42.  In addition, it provides MNP
    14	Level 5 and V.42bis data compression, for throughput up to 36,000
    15	bps.
    16	
    17	================================================================
    18	
    19	FULL FEATURED V.32 MODEM
    20	
    21	     The 9600 Plus External Modem offers an array of features
    22	providing the flexibility needed for most applications.  It
    23	offers full duplex communication at both high (9600 & 4800 bps)
    24	and low (2400, 1200, 0-300 bps) speeds and operates in both
    25	asynchronous and synchronous modes over two-wire dial-up or
    26	leased lines.  Designed according to the CCITT V.32
    27	specifications for Trellis Coded Modulation, it also supports
    28	V.22bis, V.22, V.23, V.21, Bell 212A, 103 and 202.
    29	
    30	ERROR CORRECTION GUARANTEES ACCURATE TRANSMISSION
    31	
    32	     The 9600 Plus provides error correction using MNP Levels 2,
    33	3, and 4 and is compliant with the international error correction
    34	standard V.42.  Therefore, worldwide error-free communication is
    35	provided whether transmitting domestically or internationally.
    36	
    37	TRANSFER DATA AT SPEEDS UP TO 36,000 BPS
    38	
    39	     With MNP Level 5 data compression, the 9600 Plus offers
    40	throughput of up to 19,200 bps.  When used in the Ven-Tel "V.32
    41	Turbo" mode with V.42bis, the modem is capable of data transfer
    42	speeds up to 36,000 bps.  In addition, the DTE may transmit data
    43	to the modem at speeds up to 38,400 bps thereby allowing the user
    44	to take full advantage of the DTE's higher speed for increased
    45	productivity.
    46	
    47	COMPATIBLE WITH LOCAL AREA NETWORKS
    48	
    49	     The 9600 Plus is fully compatible with Novell, 3Com, Banyan
    50	and other LAN products, providing high speed LAN-to-LAN, PC-to-
    51	LAN, or mainframe/mini-to-LAN communication.
    52	
    53	ACCESS SECURITY PROTECTS SYSTEM
    54	
    55	     Access Security restricts remote modem users from accessing
    56	the local PC or terminal, thus reducing the possibility of
    57	compromising confidential data or uploading damaging files.
    58	Three user access levels of security are provided - Callback,
    59	Programmed Callback, and PassThrough Access - as well as local
    60	and remote security supervisor access.  Up to 15 remote user
    61	names, passwords, and callback numbers may be stored in the non-
    62	volatile memory of the 9600 Plus.
    63	
    64	REMOTELY CONFIGURE THE 9600 PLUS
    65	
    66	     Ven-Tel's proprietary Remote Options Access and Downloading
    67	(R.O.A.D.) enables the system manager to access and reconfigure
    68	the 9600 Plus from any location, thereby providing optimum
    69	control of the network.  Through R.O.A.D. access, the system
    70	manager can now isolate configuration problems with a simple
    71	phone call.
    72	
    73	AT AND V.25BIS DIALERS ENABLE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATION
    74	
    75	     The 9600 Plus supports the popular AT commands used by most
    76	communications software as well as the V.25bis asynchronous and
    77	synchronous dialer.  The V.25bis dialer provides compatibility
    78	with international dialing commands and allows operation with
    79	communication software supporting V.25bis, HDLC, SDLC, and BSC
    80	commands.
