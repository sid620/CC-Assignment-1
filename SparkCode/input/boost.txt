     1				AUDIO BOOST ON THE AMIGA 500
     2	----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     3	This hardware hack is not advanced and gives you a much higher volume out
     4	of your Amiga (With good quality!)
     5	
     6	First remove the screws (This will destroy your warrenty!) from the Amiga
     7	shell (even the screws for the drive!) now carefully open your Amiga,
     8	There are some pigs holding the shell at it's place so don't break those!
     9	(as i have!)   Now remove the screws from the metallic shield and gently
    10	remove the keyboard cable! (Remember the direction the connector are!)
    11	now remove the drive! (Yet another time remember how it was connected!)
    12	now find the filter (LF347) near this circuit you find the condensators
    13	at 22uF (you will actually find two!) the condensators are named C334 and
    14	C324 and two resitors named R334 and R324 now take a dual switch and connect
    15	it like this:
    16	
    17			SWITCH:
    18	
    19	    +------------1  4------+
    20	    |                      |
    21	    | +----------2  5----+ |
    22	    | |                  | |
    23	    | |          3  6    | |
    24	    | |                  | |
    25	    | |                  | |
    26	    | + +C334            | + +C324
    27	    +--  R334            |
    28				 + R324
    29	
    30	And now you can boost more sound of ya Amiga, but be carefull you can destroy
    31	your speekers if ya pump up the volume too much!
    32	(The level meter on my gettoblaster goes to max if i turn on my boost)
    33	
    34	I must say that if your Amiga brakes down cause of this little hardware hack
    35	then don't blame me!
    36	
    37	And if you are not good at soldering then let someone else do it! (even if
    38	the soldering on this hack is really easy!) and DON'T USE A HIGH WATTAGE
    39	SOLDER IRON! (MAX 25 WATT)
