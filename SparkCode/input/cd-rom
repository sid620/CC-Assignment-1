     4	CD Summary Introduction
     5	
     6	As requested by many people, I will post this CD Summary over the next
     7	several days in five parts of which this is the first.  I received
     8	requests from rec.audio, comp.ivideodisc, and comp.graphics -- so I will
     9	post it to all these groups.  I'm not sure that it is appropriate for
    10	comp.graphics but I DID receive multiple requests to post it there.
    11	
    12	The summary is somewhat technical but more important it is factual: I
    13	wrote it after reading the original CD standards documents available from
    14	Sony or Philips to CD licensees.  If you are interested in the standards
    15	documents, you need to contact them directly -- sorry, I don't have a
    16	specific contact or phone number.
    17	
    18	I do work for Apple but this summary contains a minimum of Apple
    19	references.  I hope everyone agrees that the result is in keeping with net
    20	policy on the matter.

    34	Abstract
    35	
    36	This summary describes how information is encoded on Compact Disc (CD)
    37	beginning with the physical pits and going up through higher levels of
    38	data encoding to the structured multimedia information that is possible
    39	with programs like HyperCard.  This discussion is much broader than any
    40	single standards document, e.g. the CD-Audio Red Book, while omitting much
    41	of the detail needed only by drive manufacturers.
    42	
    43	Salient Characteristics
    44	
    45	1.  High information density -- With the density achievable using optical
    46	encoding, the CD can contain some 540 megabytes of data on a disc less
    47	than five inches in diameter.
    48	
    49	2.  Low unit cost -- Because CDs are manufactured by a well-developed
    50	process similar to that used to stamp out LP records, unit cost in large
    51	quantities is less than two dollars.
    52	
    53	3.  Read only medium -- CD-ROM is read only; it cannot be written on or
    54	erased.  It is an electronic publishing, distribution, and access medium;
    55	it cannot replace magnetic disks.
    56	
    57	4.  Modest random access performance -- Due to optical read head mass and
    58	data encoding methods, random access ("seek time") performance of CD is
    59	better than floppies but not as good as magnetic hard disks.
    60	
    61	5.  Robust, removable medium -- The CD itself is comprised mostly of, and
    62	completely coated by, durable plastic.  This fact and the data encoding
    63	method allow the CD to be resistant to scratches and other handling
    64	damage.  Media lifetime is expected to be long, well beyond that of
    65	magnetic media such as tape.  In addition, the optical servo scanning
    66	mechanism allows CDs to be removed from their drives.
    67	
    68	6.  Multimedia storage -- Because all CD data is stored digitally, it is
    69	inherently multimedia in that it can store text, images, graphics, sound,
    70	and any other information expressed in digital form.  Its only limit in
    71	this area is the rate at which data can be read from the disc, currently
    72	about 150 KBytes/second.  This is sufficient for all but uncompressed,
    73	full motion color video.
    74	
    75	CD Summary Part 2
    76	
    77	CD  Data  Hierarchy
    78	
    79	Storing data on a CD may be thought of as occurring through a data
    80	encoding hierarchy with each level built upon the previous one.  At the
    81	lowest level, data is physically stored as pits on the disc.  It is
    82	actually encoded by several low-level mechanisms to provide high storage
    83	density and reliable data recovery.  At the next level, it organized into
    84	tracks which may be digital audio or CD-ROM.  The High Sierra
    85	specification then defines a file system built on CD-ROM tracks.  Finally,
    86	applications like HyperCard specify a content format for files.
    87	
    88	The Physical Medium
    89	
    90	The Compact Disc itself is a thin plastic disk some 12 cm. in diameter.
    91	Information is encoded in a plastic-encased spiral track contained on the
    92	top of the disk.  The spiral track is read optically by a noncontact head
    93	which scans approximately radially as the disk spins just above it.  The
    94	spiral is scanned at a constant linear velocity thus assuring a constant
    95	data rate.  This requires the disc to rotate at a decreasing rate as the
    96	spiral is scanned from its beginning near the center of the disc to its
    97	end near the disc circumference.
    98	
    99	The spiral track contains shallow depressions, called pits, in a
   100	reflective layer.  Binary information is encoded by the lengths of these
   101	pits and the lengths of the areas between them, called land.  During
   102	reading, a low power laser beam from the optical head is focused on the
   103	spiral layer and is reflected back into the head.  Due to the optical
   104	characteristics of the plastic disc and  the wavelength of light used, the
   105	quantity of reflected light varies depending on whether the beam is on
   106	land or on a pit.  The modulated, reflected light is converted to a radio
   107	frequency, raw data signal by a photodetector in the optical head.
   108	
   109	Low-level Data Encoding
   110	
   111	To ensure accurate recovery, the disc data must be encoded to optimize the
   112	analog-to-digital conversion process that  the radio frequency signal must
   113	undergo.  Goals of the low level data encoding include:
   114	
   115	1.  High information density.  This requires encoding that makes the best
   116	possible use of the high, but limited, resolution of the laser beam and
   117	read head optics.
   118	
   119	2.  Minimum intersymbol interference.  This requires making the minimum
   120	run length, i.e. the minimum number of consecutive zero bits or one bits,
   121	as large as possible.
   122	
   123	3.  Self-clocking.  To avoid a separate timing track, the data should be
   124	encoded so as to allow the clock signal to be regenerated from the data
   125	signal.  This requires limiting the maximum run length of the data so that
   126	data transitions will regenerate the clock.
   127	
   128	4.  Low digital sum value (the number of one bits minus the number of zero
   129	bits).  This minimizes the low frequency and DC content of the data signal
   130	which permits optimal servo system operation.
   131	
   132	A straightforward encoding would be to simply to encode zero bits as land
   133	and one bits as pits.  However, this does not meet goal (1) as well as the
   134	encoding scheme actually used.  The current CD scheme encodes one bits as
   135	transitions from pit to land or land to pit and zero bits as constant pit
   136	or constant land.
   137	
   138	To meet goals (2) to (4), it is not possible to encode arbitrary binary
   139	data.  For example, the integer 0 expressed as thirty-two bits of zero
   140	would have too long a run length to satisfy goal (3).  To accommodate
   141	these goals, each eight-bit byte of actual data is encoded as fourteen
   142	bits of channel data.  There are many more combinations of fourteen bits
   143	(16,384) than there are of eight bits (256).  To encode the eight-bit
   144	combinations, 256 combinations of fourteen bits are chosen that meet the
   145	goals.  This encoding is referred to as Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation (EFM)
   146	coding.
   147	
   148	If fourteen channel bits were concatenated with another set of fourteen
   149	channel bits, once again the above goals may not be met.  To avoid this
   150	possibility, three merging bits are included between each set of fourteen
   151	channel bits.  These merging bits carry no information but are chosen to
   152	limit run length, keep data signal DC content low, etc.  Thus, an eight
   153	bit byte of actual data is encoded into a total of seventeen channel bits:
   154	 fourteen EFM bits and three merging bits.
   155	
   156	To achieve a reliable self-clocking system, periodic synchronization is
   157	necessary.  Thus, data is broken up into individual frames each beginning
   158	with a synchronization pattern.  Each frame also contains twenty-four data
   159	bytes, eight error correction bytes, a control and display byte (carrying
   160	the subcoding channels), and merging bits separating them all.  Each frame
   161	is arranged as follows:
   162	
   163	Sync Pattern24 + 3channel bits
   164	Control and Display byte14 + 3
   165	Data bytes12 * (14 + 3)
   166	Error Correction bytes 4 * (14 + 3)
   167	Data bytes12 * (14 + 3)
   168	Error Correction bytes 4 * (14 + 3)
   169	
   170	TOTAL588channel bits
   171	
   172	Thus, 192 actual data bits (24 bytes) are encoded as 588 channel bits.
   173	
   174	Editorial:  A CD physically has a single spiral track about 3 miles long.
   175	CDs spin at about 500 RPM when reading near the center down to about 250
   176	RPM when reading near the circumference.
   177	
   178	Disc with a 'c' or disk with a 'k'?  A usage has emerged for these terms:
   179	disk is used for eraseable disks (e.g. magnetic disks) while disc is used
   180	for read-only (e.g. CD-ROM discs).  One would presumably call a frisbee a
   181	disc.

   185	CD Summary Part 3
   186	
   187	First Level Error Correction
   188	
   189	Data errors can arise from production defects in the disk itself, defects
   190	arising from subsequent damage to the disk, or jarring during reading.  A
   191	significant characteristic of  these errors is that they often occur in
   192	long bursts.  This could be due, for example, to a relatively wide mark on
   193	the disc that is opaque to the laser beam used to read the disc.  A system
   194	with two logical components called the Cross Interleave Reed-Solomon
   195	Coding (CIRC) is employed for error correction.  The cross interleave
   196	component breaks up the long error bursts into many short errors; the
   197	Reed-Solomon component provides the error correction.
   198	
   199	As each frame is read from the disc, it is first decoded from fourteen
   200	channel bits (the three merging bits are ignored) into eight-bit data
   201	bytes.  Then, the bytes from each frame (twenty-four data bytes and eight
   202	error correction bytes) are passed to the first Reed-Solomon decoder which
   203	uses four of the error correction bytes and is able to correct one byte in
   204	error out of the 32.  If there are no uncorrectable errors, the data is
   205	simply passed along.  If there are errors, the data is marked as being in
   206	error at this stage of decoding.
   207	
   208	The twenty-four data bytes and four remaining error correction bytes are
   209	then passed through unequal delays before going through another
   210	Reed-Solomon decoder.  These unequal delays result in an interleaving of
   211	the data that spreads long error bursts among many different passes
   212	through the second decoder.  The delays are such that error bursts up to
   213	450 bytes long can be completely corrected.  The second Reed-Solomon
   214	decoder uses the last four error correction bytes to correct any remaining
   215	errors in the twenty-four data bytes.  At this point, the data goes
   216	through a de-interleaving process to restore the correct byte order.
   217	
   218	Subcoding Channels and Blocks
   219	
   220	The eight-bit control and display byte in each frame carries the subcoding
   221	channels.  A subcoding block consists of 98 subcoding bytes, and thus 98
   222	of the 588-bit frames.  A block then can contain 2352 bytes of data.
   223	Seventy-five blocks are read each second.  With this information, it is
   224	now straightforward to calculate that the CD data rate is in fact correct
   225	for CD digital audio (CD-DA):
   226	
   227	Required CD digital audio data rate:  44.1 K samples per second * 16 bits
   228	per sample * 2 channels = 1,411,200 bits/sec.
   229	
   230	CD data rate:  8 bits per byte * 24 bytes per frame * 98 frames per
   231	subcoding block * 75 subcoding blocks per second = 1,411,200 bits/sec.
   232	
   233	The eight subcoding channels are labeled P through W and are encoded one
   234	bit for each channel in a control and display byte.  Channel P is used as
   235	a simple music track separator.  Channel Q is used for control purposes
   236	and encodes information like track number, track type, and location
   237	(minute, second, and frame number).  During the lead-in track of the disc,
   238	channel Q encodes a table of contents for the disk giving track number and
   239	starting location.  Standards have been proposed that would use the
   240	remaining channels for line graphics and ASCII character strings, but
   241	these are seldom used.
   242	
   243	Track Types
   244	
   245	Tracks can have two types as specified in the control bit field of
   246	subchannel Q.  The first type is CD digital audio (CD-DA) tracks.  The
   247	two-channel audio is sampled at 44.1 Khz with sixteen bit linear sampling
   248	encoded as twos complement numbers.  The sixteen bit samples are separated
   249	into two eight-bit bytes; the bytes from each channel alternate on the
   250	disc.   Variations for audio tracks include pre-emphasis and four track
   251	recording.
   252	
   253	The other type of track specified by the subchannel Q control bit field is
   254	the data track.  These must conform to the CD-ROM standard described
   255	below.  In general, a disc can have a mix of CD digital audio tracks and a
   256	CD-ROM track, but the CD-ROM track must come first.
   257	
   258	Editorial:  This first level error correction (the only type used for CD
   259	Audio data) is extremely powerful.  The CD specification allows for discs
   260	to have up to 220 raw errors per second.  Every one of these errors is
   261	(almost always) perfectly corrected by the CIRC scheme for a net error
   262	rate of zero.  For example, our tests using Apple's CD-ROM drive (which
   263	also plays audio) show that raw error rates are around 50-100 per second
   264	these days.  Of course, these are perfectly corrected, meaning that the
   265	original data is perfectly recovered.  We have tested flawed discs with
   266	raw rates up to 300 per second.  Net errors on all of these discs?  Zero!
   267	I would expect a typical audio CD player to perform similarly.  Thus I
   268	expect this raw error rate to have no audible consequences.
   269	
   270	So why did I say "almost always" corrected above?  Because a sufficiently
   271	bad flaw may produce uncorrectable errors.  These very unusual errors are
   272	"concealed" by the player rather than corrected.  Note that this
   273	concealment is likely to be less noticeable than even a single scratch on
   274	an LP.  Such a flaw might be a really opaque finger smudge; CDs do merit
   275	careful handling.  On the two (and only two) occasions I have found these,
   276	I simply sprayed on a little Windex glass cleaner and wiped it off using
   277	radial strokes.  This restored the CDs to zero net errors.
   278	
   279	One can argue about the quality of the process of conversion of analog
   280	music to and from digital representation, but in the digital domain CDs
   281	are really very, very good.
   282	
   283	CD Summary Part 4
   284	
   285	CD-ROM Data Tracks
   286	
   287	Each CD-ROM data track is divided into individually addressable blocks of
   288	2352 data bytes, i.e. one subcoding block or 98 frames.  A header in each
   289	block contains the block address and the mode of the block.  The block
   290	address is identical to the encoding of minute, second, and frame number
   291	in subcode channel Q.  The modes defined in the CD-ROM specification are:
   292	
   293	Mode 0 -- all data bytes are zero.
   294	
   295	Mode 1 -- (CD-ROM Data):
   296	Sync Field - 12 bytes
   297	Header Field - 4
   298	User Data Field - 2048
   299	Error Detection Code - 4
   300	Reserved - 8
   301	Error Correction - 276
   302	
   303	Mode 2 -- (CD Audio or Other Data):
   304	Sync Field - 12 bytes
   305	Header Field - 4
   306	User Data Field - 2048
   307	Auxiliary Data Field - 288
   308	
   309	Thus, mode 1 defines separately addressable, physical 2K byte data blocks
   310	making CD-ROM look at this level very similar to other digital mass
   311	storage devices.
   312	
   313	Second Level Error Correction
   314	
   315	An uncorrected error in audio data typically results in a brief, often
   316	inaudible click during listening at worst.  An uncorrected error in other
   317	kinds of data, for example program code, may render a CD unusable.  For
   318	this reason, CD-ROM defines a second level of error detection and error
   319	correction (EDC/ECC) for mode 1 data.  The information for the EDC/ECC
   320	occupies most of the auxiliary data field.
   321	
   322	The error detection code is a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) on the sync,
   323	header, and user data.  It occupies the first four bytes of the auxiliary
   324	data field and provides a very high probability that uncorrected errors
   325	will be detected.  The error correction code is essentially the same as
   326	the first level error correction in that interleaving and Reed-Solomon
   327	coding are used.  It occupies the final 276 bytes of the auxiliary data
   328	field.
   329	
   330	Editorial:  This extra level of error correction for CD-ROM blocks is one
   331	of the many reasons that CD-ROM drives are much more expensive than
   332	consumer audio players.  To perform this error correction quickly requires
   333	substantial extra computing power (sometimes a dedicated microprocessor)
   334	in the drive.
   335	
   336	This is also one reason that consumer players like the Magnavoxes which
   337	claim to be CD-ROM compatible (with their digital output jack on the back)
   338	are useless for that purpose.  They have no way of dealing with the CD-ROM
   339	error correction.  They also have no way for a computer to tell them where
   340	to seek.
   341	
   342	Another reason that CD-ROM drives are more expensive is that they are
   343	built to be a computer peripheral rather than a consumer device, i.e. like
   344	a combination race car/truck rather than a family sedan.  One story,
   345	probably apocryphal but not far from the truth, has it that a major
   346	Japanese manufacturer tested some consumer audio players to simulate
   347	computer use:  they made them seek (move the optical head) from the inside
   348	of the CD to the outside and back again.  These are called maximum seeks.
   349	The story says they managed to do this for about 24 hours before they
   350	broke down.  A CD-ROM drive needs to be several orders of magnitude more
   351	robust.  Fast and strong don't come cheap.
   352	
   353	CD Summary Part 5
   354	
   355	The High Sierra File System Standard
   356	
   357	Built on top of the addressable 2K blocks that the CD-ROM specification
   358	defines, the next higher level of data encoding is a file system that
   359	permits logical organization of the data on the CD.  This can be a native
   360	file system like the Macintosh Hierarchical File System (HFS).  Another
   361	alternative is the High Sierra (also known as the ISO 9660) file standard,
   362	recently approved by the National Information Standards Organization
   363	(NISO) and the International Standards Organization (ISO), which defines a
   364	file system carefully tuned to CD characteristics.  In particular:
   365	
   366	1.  CDs have modest seek time and high capacity.  As a result, the High
   367	Sierra standard makes tradeoffs that reduce the number of seeks needed to
   368	read a file at the expense of space efficiency.
   369	
   370	2.  CDs are read-only.  Thus, concerns like space allocation, file
   371	deletion, and the like are not addressed in the specification.
   372	
   373	For High Sierra file systems, each individual CD is a volume.  Several CDs
   374	may be grouped together in a volume set and there is a mechanism for
   375	subsequent volumes in a set to update preceding ones.  Volumes can contain
   376	standard file structures, coded character set file structures for
   377	character encoding other than ASCII, or boot records.  Boot records can
   378	contain either data or program code that may be needed by systems or
   379	applications.
   380	
   381	High Sierra Directories and Files
   382	
   383	The file system is a hierarchical one in which directories may contain
   384	files or other directories.  Each volume has a root directory which serves
   385	as an ancestor to all other directories or files in the volume.  This
   386	dictates an overall tree structure for the volume.
   387	
   388	A typical disadvantage in hierarchical systems is that to read a file
   389	(which must be a leaf of the hierarchy tree) given its full path name, it
   390	is necessary to begin at the root directory and search through each of its
   391	ancestral directories until the entry for the file is found.  For example,
   392	given the path name "Wine Regions:America:California:Mendocino", three
   393	directories (the first three components of the path name) would need to be
   394	searched.  Typically, a separate seek would be required for each
   395	directory.  This would result in relatively poor performance.
   396	
   397	To avoid this, High Sierra specifies that each volume contain a path table
   398	in addition to its directories and files.  The path table describes the
   399	directory hierarchy in a compact form that may be cached in computer
   400	memory for optimum performance.  The path table contains entries for the
   401	volume's directories in a breadth-first order; directories with a common
   402	parent are listed in lexicographic order.  Each entry contains only the
   403	location of the directory it describes, its name, and the location in the
   404	path table of its parent.  This mechanism allows any directory to be
   405	accessed with only a single CD seek.
   406	
   407	Directories contain more detailed information than the path table.  Each
   408	directory entry contains:
   409	
   410	Directory or file location.
   411	File length.
   412	Date and time of creation.
   413	Name of the file.
   414	Flags:
   415	Whether the entry is for a file or a directory.
   416	Whether or not it is an associated file.
   417	Whether or not it has records.
   418	Whether or not it has read protection.
   419	Whether or not it has subsequent extents.
   420	Interleave structure of the file.
   421	
   422	Interleaving may be used, for example, to meet realtime requirements for
   423	multiple files whose contents must be presented simultaneously.  This
   424	would happen if a file containing graphic images were interleaved with a
   425	file containing compressed sound that describes the images.
   426	
   427	Files themselves are recorded in contiguous (or interleaved) blocks on the
   428	disc.  The read-only nature of CD permits this contiguous recording in a
   429	straightforward manner.  A file may also be recorded in a series of
   430	noncontiguous extents with a directory entry for each extent.
   431	
   432	The specification does not favor any particular computer architecture.  In
   433	particular all significant, multibyte numbers are recorded twice, once
   434	with the most significant byte first and once with the least significant
   435	byte first.
   436	
   437	Multimedia Information
   438	
   439	Using the file system are applications that create and portray multimedia
   440	information.  While it is true that a CD can store anything that a
   441	magnetic disk can store (and usually much more of it), CDs will be used
   442	more for storing information than for storing programs.  It is the very
   443	large storage capacity of CDs coupled with their low cost that opens up
   444	the possibilities for interactive, multimedia information to be used in a
   445	multitude of ways.
   446	
   447	Programs like HyperCard, with it's ease of authoring and broad
   448	extensibility, are very useful for this purpose.  Hypercard stacks, with
   449	related information such as color images and sound, can be easily and
   450	inexpensively stored on CDs despite their possibly very large size.
   451	
   452	Editorial:  The High Sierra file system gets its name from the location of
   453	the first meeting on it:  the High Sierra Hotel at Lake Tahoe.  It is much
   454	more commonly referred to as ISO 9660, though the two specifications are
   455	slightly different.
   456	
   457	It has gotten very easy and inexpensive to make a CD-ROM disc (or audio
   458	CD).  For example, you can now take a Macintosh hard disk and send it with
   459	$1500 to one of several CD pressers.  They will send you back your hard
   460	disk and 100 CDs with exactly the same content as what's on your disk.
   461	This is the easy way to make CDs with capacity up to the size of your hard
   462	disk (Apple's go up to 160 megabytes).  True, this is not a full CD but
   463	CDs don't need to be full.  If you have just 10 megabytes and need 100
   464	copies, CDs may be the best way to go.
   465	
   466	If you are buying a CD-ROM drive, there are several factors you might
   467	consider in making your choice.  Two factors NOT to consider are capacity
   468	and data rate.  The capacity of all CD-ROM drives is determined solely by
   469	the CD they are reading.  Though you will see a range of numbers in
   470	manufacturers' specs (e.g. 540, 550, 600, and 650 Mbytes), any drive can
   471	read any disc and so they are all fundamentally the same.  All CD-ROM
   472	drives read data at a net 150 Kbytes/sec for CD-ROM data.  Other data
   473	rates you may see may include error correction data (not included in the
   474	net rate) or may be a mode 2 data rate (faster than mode 1).  All drives
   475	will be the same in all of these specs.
   476	
   477	[ Editorial:  The last paragraph is wrong on both points.  This may have
   478	been true in 1988, when this article was written, but is no longer true
   479	today (in 1992).  A few drives cannot read CDROMs with more than about
   480	620 megabytes on them.  There is a huge variation in speed.  Today only
   481	the slowest drives read at 150 kb/sec.  Most read at least 300 and at
   482	least one (the Pioneer DRM-600X) reads at 600 kb/sec. ]

   514	Atari owners have been waiting with baited breath for CD-ROM to arrive
   515	on the Atari platform. Actually the CD-ROM portion has been around for
   516	quite a while but now you can add Photo CD to the long list of tools
   517	available on the Atari ST, TT030, and Falcon030.
   518	
   519	This is a guide to CD-ROM in general and what it all means to the user.
   520	Its purpose is to go beyond the endless lists of terms on optical media
   521	and CD-ROM and explain how it can work for you. Included is a glossary
   522	of terms so one can have something to refer to when an unknown term
   523	appears.

   593	/*********************************************************************/
   594	--==-- A) What is CD-ROM?
   595	
   596	Physically, CD-ROM is the same compact disc that has become the standard
   597	for the delivery of music. It is a plastic disc, 4-3/4" (12cm) in
   598	diameter, on which data is recorded digitally. There is also a 3-1/2"
   599	(8cm) form factor, equivalent to the mini-disc music product (although
   600	this size is currently used only in Sony's Data DiscMan portable reader).
   601	Because compact disc is a digital medium, it is a natural for delivery of
   602	information of a variety of types - text, photos, audio,
   603	computer-generated graphics, video and software - to a computer host.
   604	
   605	CD-ROM has many unique features that suit it to information delivery. It
   606	has a capacity of approximately 650 million characters (about 200 million
   607	characters for the mini-disc). This capacity is analogous to any number of
   608	measures. It is equivalent to over 1500 high-density floppies (1.44
   609	megabyte disk size), or over 200,000 pages of printed text. By using a
   610	lower sampling frequency for recording audio, it can hold many hours of
   611	sound. It can hold upwards of 10,000 high quality photographs. By using
   612	compression and decompression techniques (in partnership with the host
   613	computer), these numbers can be greatly increased.
   614	
   615	It is a very durable delivery medium. It is not indestructible, but it is
   616	not subject to magnetic fields as hard disks are, and it can be mailed
   617	with minimal protection. The disc itself weighs only an ounce or two, and
   618	thus is highly portable. Technical standards enable a CD-ROM to be
   619	"portable," in a computer sense, across many types of systems.
   620	
   621	Because compact discs are mastered and inexpensively replicated in
   622	quantity, CD-ROM is an ideal medium for "publishing" many copies of large
   623	volumes of information. Because the discs are digital and have a high
   624	capacity, they are amenable to entirely new categories of products - such
   625	as multimedia - which have not been "published" in the past, because there
   626	was no practical means to do so.
   627	
   628	Thus there are large databases that have formerly been accessible only
   629	online being published, in whole or in part, on CD-ROM. We see multimedia
   630	presentations, which formerly were only accessible from large magnetic
   631	discs, being packaged and distributed like other publications. CD-ROM has
   632	inspired new methods for the delivery of existing materials, it has
   633	inspired the creation of radically new materials, and it has inspired a
   634	complete re-thinking of traditional publishing and distribution processes.
   635	For this reason, we see CD-ROM as the catalyst and the means for a
   636	"revolution" in publishing.
   637	
   638	Compact disc was created and defined in a series of proprietary standards
   639	by a joint effort of Sony and Philips. Compact disc-audio was introduced
   640	as a commercial product in 1982. The first CD-ROM applications were
   641	introduced for sale in late 1985. CD-I was announced in 1986, the first
   642	commercial products were sold in the fall of 1991. CDTV was first sold in
   643	the spring of 1991. The MPC specification was introduced in 1991, and the
   644	first MPC-compliant upgrade kits and titles were launched in late 1991. Of
   645	course, there are new CD-ROM based devices coming from Sony (via the
   646	handheld Data Discman and the so-called Bookman), Tandy (VIS) and
   647	cartridge-based game systems producers like Sega, NEC and Nintendo.
   648	
   649	CD-ROM differs from CD-audio in that certain data are added to meet the
   650	needs of computer operating systems, and to assure that the data you
   651	receive are the same as the data originally recorded. To meet the needs of
   652	a computer's operating system, a header is required that describes the
   653	nature and location of the data on the disc. This is called a
   654	volume-table-of contents, or VTOC in computer-ese. The integrity of the
   655	data is assured through the use of multiple layers of error-correction
   656	codes, which further distinguish CD-ROM from CD-audio. The structure and
   657	use of these components are mandated by standards such as the Yellow Book
   658	(which defines the recording of data for computer use, extending the
   659	CD-audio standard described in the Red Book), and ISO 9660, an
   660	international standard that defines the VTOC.
   661	
   662	Within these constraints, there are many ways to deliver information for
   663	specific platforms and applications. These differing methods have lead to
   664	the proliferation of "CD-ROM formats" - such as CD-ROM-XA, CD-I and so
   665	forth. These are described in detail below. However, all formats conform
   666	first to the CD-audio standard, second to the CD-ROM standard, and third
   667	to the extended specifications required for each format. In short, CD-I is
   668	a format of CD-ROM, CDTV is a format of CD-ROM, etc.
   669	
   670	CD-ROM requires a computer to read, interpret and display data, and to
   671	deal with the interactive nature of CD-ROM access and use. The initial
   672	products were exclusively computer host-based: the drive is attached as a
   673	peripheral to a personal computer. In recent years, a new category of
   674	products has emerged: the so-called "information appliances," such as
   675	CD-I, VIS, Data Discman, etc. These products also use computers, but the
   676	computer-ness is embedded in the use of the product. The technical aspects
   677	of many of these products are described below.
   678	
   679	
   680	--==-- B) What is the difference between "disc" and "disk"?
   681	
   682	The convention is that "disc" refers to optical media, while "disk" refers
   683	to magnetic media. The distinction is important, because the different
   684	spellings signify very different products. Most trade media seem to be
   685	oblivious to the distinction.
   686	
   687	By the way, the absolutely correct way of referring to CDROM is "CD-ROM."
   688	This author and others often remove the hyphen because a) it does not
   689	change the meaning and b) it is easier to type. CD-ROM should not be
   690	shortened to "CDR" because CD-R refers to compact disc-recordable
   691	systems, or CD-Write Once.
   692	
   693	
   694	--==-- C) How standardized is CD-ROM?
   695	
   696	CD-ROM is one of the most thoroughly standardized computer sub-systems in
   697	the history of the business. The medium is standard, and the drives that
   698	read the medium are defined by standards. The format of the header which
   699	enables cross-platform access to data - ISO 9660 - is standardized.
   700	
   701	Not all is perfect, however. CD-ROM developers must do business in the
   702	real world comprised of a variety of computer platforms, operating
   703	systems, and other factors. So the information content on a CD-ROM remains
   704	- to some extent - dependent on the system which will access and use the
   705	data.
   706	
   707	
   708	--==-- D) What is SCSI, and why is it important to CD-ROM?
   709	
   710	The Small Computer System Interface (SCSI - generally pronounced
   711	"scuzzee"), is a standard which permits the connection of up to 7
   712	different devices to the host computer. Each device still requires its own
   713	driver software.
   714	
   715	The use of SCSI requires an interface board inserted in an expansion slot
   716	of a PC. Macintosh and UNIX systems are natively SCSI-based. One advantage
   717	of SCSI is that expansion slots are conserved - instead of a proprietary
   718	interface board required for each device, several can share the same
   719	interface. Devices such as scanners, printers, hard drives, CD-R drives
   720	like Philips CDD-521, MO drives, WORM drives, and some network cards
   721	(usually ethernet), can use SCSI in addition to CD-ROM drives.
   722	
   723	Virtually all CD-ROM drive manufacturers have one or more models that are
   724	SCSI compatible. In most cases, the consumer has a choice of acquiring the
   725	interface board from the CD-ROM drive vendor, or using a board from a
   726	third party. At the risk of offending some vendors by exclusion, note that
   727	interfaces from Adaptec, UltraStor and Future Domain receive many comments
   728	on the CD-ROM Forum.
   729	
   730	A new variation on SCSI has emerged. The original standard, now called
   731	SCSI-1, has been enhanced with a new specification called SCSI-2. SCSI-2
   732	has standardized audio commands for CD-ROM drives. So using a SCSI-2
   733	"play" command will work on all SCSI-2 CD-ROM drives, eliminating the need
   734	for unique audio device drivers for each CD-ROM drive. SCSI-2 is
   735	backwardly compatible with SCSI-1, so a SCSI-1 device will work with a
   736	SCSI-2 interface board.
   737	
   738	In addition, SCSI-2 will offer faster transfer speed for devices that can
   739	support it, and the capability to transfer 16- and 32-bit paths in
   740	addition to the normal 8-bits. Standard SCSI connectors have 50 pins, a
   741	new wide SCSI has a 68-pin connector. SCSI-2 has not been formally
   742	approved yet, although some vendors are offering products with these
   743	features.
   744	
   745	(My thanks to Albert Dayes for providing the majority of this data.)
   746	
   747	 NOTE:  The Atari TT is SCSI based and the Atari Falcon030 is SCSI-2
   748	        based, and with Atari and third party host adapters like ICD one
   749	        can have SCSI-1 or SCSI-2 adapters available for use on the Atari
   750	        ST series of computers.
   751	
   752	
   753	--==-- E) How is CD-ROM related to laserdisc (videodisc)?
   754	
   755	In the mid-1970's a number of companies introduced a 12" disc product
   756	which could deliver movies and other graphical/video content superior to
   757	that of videotape formats. What we know now as the laserdisc, or
   758	videodisc, has been up, and it has been down, in terms of market
   759	acceptance. It has been of consistent interest for training and
   760	educational purposes, because it provided an "interactive" capability for
   761	the use of video material that tape does not provide. Recently, videodisc
   762	has seen a resurgence in the consumer marketplace.
   763	
   764	Laserdisc is an analog format: the data are recorded on the disc just as
   765	in any other analog medium like video or audio tape. CD-ROM is a digital
   766	format. Laserdisc gives a superior quality video picture and high quality
   767	sound. Laserdisc is not a good medium for delivery of text, software or
   768	manipulatable data elements. Digital video technology is still being
   769	perfected, but no one would claim that CD-ROM can deliver as a good a tv
   770	picture as laserdisc.
   771	
   772	The advantage CD-ROM brings to the table is the ability to mix and match a
   773	wide variety of data elements through retrieval or authoring software. If
   774	the sole requirement of the consumer is high-quality video, then laserdisc
   775	is the right product to buy. If, however, the requirement is for random
   776	access to large volumes of mixed-format data, a high degree of
   777	interactivity, or converging published data with other computer
   778	applications, then CD-ROM is the right product. It is this flexibility
   779	(albeit with limitations in the video arena) that has captured the
   780	attention of many new publishers.
   781	
   782	
   783	--==-- F) What are the CD-ROM standards?
   784	
   785	The standards have two levels, the physical and logical level. The
   786	physical defines how the actual disc is made (size, material, etc). The
   787	logical defines how a device driver or operating system will view the data
   788	that is placed on the disc.
   789	
   790	There is a broad standard that gives the physical characteristics of the
   791	disc and this is called the "Yellow Book." The "Yellow Book" defines all
   792	the physical requirements for any CD-ROM disc. The "Yellow Book" has
   793	everything basically that the "Red Book" has and more. Audio CDs are
   794	defined by the "Red Book," and the "Yellow Book" allows for CD-ROM to have
   795	either data or audio tracks or a hybrid that allows for both types of
   796	tracks on a CD-ROM. This hybrid is usually referred to as mixed mode.
   797	
   798	The logical format one can also think of as the filesystem of the CD-ROM.
   799	In the 1986 the High Sierra format was made and when the ISO
   800	(International Standards Organization) modified it became the ISO-9660
   801	standard. This ISO-9660 standard is very important since it allows for any
   802	type of system to be able to read it. Platform independence was one of the
   803	very important features of the ISO-9660 standard. One does notice that it
   804	has a strong MS-DOS influence in its overall design and in some of the
   805	limits.
   806	
   807	It is important to note that logical format can be any filesystem and does
   808	not necessarily mean ISO-9660. For example some discs are in Apple
   809	Macintosh HFS (Hierarchical File System) rather than ISO-9660.
   810	
   811	CD-ROM/XA allows everything listed above and it added a compressed audio
   812	capability. Also, the layouts of the tracks on the physical disc have been
   813	modified to allow for more specific track information. CD-I and Photo CD
   814	are built on top of this enhancement to CD-ROM. The audio is ADPCM and it
   815	is interleaved with data. This allows for nicely synchronized audio
   816	without taking away CPU time. It is not used very much currently but this
   817	may change in the future.
   818	
   819	Rich Bowers, Executive Director of the OPA sums it up nicely.
   820	
   821	    Its primary purpose was to interleave audio with other data, in effect
   822	    to synchronize audio with a visual presentation.  Think in terms of
   823	    making the sound come out in synch with the lips moving.
   824	
   825	    When you consider it, there are basically two kinds of data: those
   826	    which are time-sequence dependent and those which are not. A database
   827	    retrieval or the presentation of a single graphic is independent of
   828	    other data from a time perspective. Audio is absolutely tied to a
   829	    time-sequence. Video data is also dependent on time-sequencing,
   830	    although we have some freedom in representing motion because the
   831	    psychological phenomenon that lets us fill in the blanks in our minds,
   832	    in essence to see things that aren't there. Audio is less flexible
   833	    that way.
   834	
   835	    XA is a physical means of storing data that depends on the
   836	    time-sequencing of related data. A new standard called HyTime (about
   837	    which I hope to have a file uploaded soon) is a production technique
   838	    for dealing with time-sequenced data, based on the SGML mark-up
   839	    strategy.
   840	
   841	
   842	Rock Ridge extensions to the ISO-9660 standard allow all the features of
   843	the UNIX filesystem to be used. These extra information is stored the
   844	System Use fields defined in the ISO-9660 standard. The information that
   845	is stored there for UNIX/POSIX include uid, gid, permissions, file mode
   846	bits, file types, setuid, setgid, sticky bit, file links, device nodes,
   847	symbolic links, POSIX filenames, reconstruction of deep directories and
   848	time stamps.
   849	
   850	
   851	--==-- G) What benefit is CD-ROM to me?
   852	
   853	The benefits can be quite numerous once you start listing all of them.
   854	First we can discuss some of the possible uses for CD-ROMs.
   855	
   856	Desk Top Publishing = Large amount of clip art, fonts and images can be
   857	& Graphic Designers   found for relatively low cost from many vendors.
   858	                      Kodak Photo CD's can have a great impact in this
   859	                      area as well.
   860	
   861	Musicians &         = CD-ROM discs can hold a huge amount of different
   862	Audio Engineers       samples and sound effects covering a large range
   863	                      of topics at a very reasonable cost. Generic
   864	                      sequences for MIDI will also be available in the
   865	                      future.
   866	
   867	Writers             = Reference materials including dictionaries,
   868	                      quotations and complete works by a large variety
   869	                      of authors on one disc.
   870	
   871	Programmers         = Walnut Creek has 600 megabytes of source code for
   872	                      under $40. Being able to store all that source
   873	                      code in a concise place is a major benefit of
   874	                      CD-ROM. One can get C source code which includes
   875	                      a part of BSD UNIX (including the networking code),
   876	                      X-Windows (X11R5), and entire GNU source code for
   877	                      under $50. The entire library of the C USERS
   878	                      JOURNAL plus all of the program source code
   879	                      listings in the magazine (since 1987) for $50.
   880	
   881	Marketing Managers  = Census data can be purchased on CD-ROM in a raw
   882	                      ascii data format and can be loaded into a database
   883	                      or spreadsheet for endless "what if" type of
   884	                      manipulation. Also there are many CD-ROMs that
   885	                      target specific geographical regions that can be
   886	                      very useful for niche markets.
   887	
   888	Space Exploration   = One can purchase CD-ROMs from the different space
   889	                      missions for under $10 each from the NASA Space
   890	                      Science Data Center.
   891	
   892	Geology and         = The US Geological survey has quite a few CD-ROMs
   893	Mapping               consisting of the entire USA or specific geographical
   894	                      regions for quite a low cost. One interested in
   895	                      graphics could generate some nice 3D graphic models.
   896	
   897	Games               = Games are coming to CD-ROM slowly but surely.
   898	
   899	Health Providers    = Important Medical Journals, and medical research
   900	                      papers are available now on CD-ROM.
   901	
   902	Lawyers             = There are a few CD-ROMs of all the laws for specific
   903	                      states and even compilations from West Publishing,
   904	                      one of the largest law publishers which also includes
   905	                      an on-line service for lawyers.
   906	
   907	Optical Publishing  = Custom designed CD-ROMs that contain complete
   908	                      specifications and documents is a very strong
   909	                      growing area of the CD-ROM market. This also
   910	                      includes multi-media titles as well and much
   911	                      more.
   912	
   913	Education           = Interactive learning using multi-media on CD-ROMs.
   914	                      Research papers and much more are available in this
   915	                      exploding market.
   916	
   917	Religion            = The Bible (in many versions), Koran and many other
   918	                      works from different religions all on one disc.
   919	
   920	Family Album        = Store all the family pictures on a single disc using
   921	                      Photo CD.
   922	
   923	Anyone              = Archiving important data for later retrieval. This
   924	                      data can be anything: financial, marketing, C source
   925	                      code, software, games, papers, audio, etc.
   926	
   927	General             = There is a tremendous amount of information on
   928	                      CD-ROM discs in just plain ASCII format that anyone
   929	                      can use with their computer. Just import it into
   930	                      a word processor, spreadsheet or database and
   931	                      there are endless possibilities.
   932	
   933	One could go on and on about the possibilities.
   934	
   935	
   936	What types are available for the Atari currently?
   937	
   938	All discs that are ISO-9660 compliant and contain raw data, sound, clip
   939	art, images, etc, can be used on the Atari immediately. Currently there
   940	are not any CD-ROMs specifically designed for the Atari ST except for a
   941	couple that include many different shareware programs. You can not run
   942	programs on CD-ROMs designed for other platforms like the IBM PC or the
   943	MAC; it just like attempting to run a PC program from your Atari... it
   944	won't work.
   945	
   946	This will change once more people get CD-ROM drives on the Atari and start
   947	asking for titles. The Atari Falcon030 and the TT030 have both been to
   948	shown to work with Kodak's Photo CD at the recent Fall 1992 Comdex show.
   949	It was working directly with an application (a DeskTop Publishing program)
   950	called Calamus SL.
   951	
   952	The key here is the hardware and software is available to use CD-ROMs on
   953	the Atari is available NOW! Both Atari and ICD have drivers available that
   954	work with SCSI CD-ROM drives.
   955	
   956	
   957	--==-- H) How much does it cost to produce my own CD-ROM disc?
   958	
   959	One can take 600 megabytes of a hard disk and save it to tape, then send
   960	to some specific publishers and they will convert it to a single CD-ROM
   961	for $200. One could probably use Beckemeyer's SCSI TAPE KIT or Oregon
   962	Research Associates Diamond Back III to perform that operation.
   963	
   964	One should check to be sure that the publisher can handle the current tape
   965	format. The format usually used is TAR. TAR allows for files to be backed
   966	up and restored on many different platforms. In addition, it can split
   967	large files and each tape is independent of the other tapes when it comes
   968	to restoration.
   969	
   970	If one wants to be able to create One-Offs or CD-WO discs one needs to
   971	spend around $12,000 for everything one would need. Then you can create
   972	your own discs at your convenience and then send it off to the duplicator
   973	for more copies when you need to. The CD-WO media is under $50 so it isn't
   974	too expensive from a media point of view.
   975	
   976	The most expensive part of the creating One-Offs is CD-Writer itself which
   977	ranges from around $7000 and up depending on the features available.
   978	These devices are usually SCSI devices and create a CD disc (audio or
   979	data) in about 30 to 70 minutes on average. The software to create a disc
   980	image (usually called the pre-mastering phase) is around $2500 and up.
   981	Plus a computer to handle all of that can be $3000 and up. Prices are
   982	dropping all the time so it might now be too long before many people have
   983	personal CD-Writers.
   984	
   985	
   986	--==-- I) What is Kodak's Photo CD?
   987	
   988	Is a new standard based upon an extension CD-ROM/XA specification since
   989	it adds additional information at the track level. This new format is
   990	called the CD-Bridge format and it is what Kodak's Photo CD is based on.
   991	
   992	    The Photo CD system, jointly developed by Eastman Kodak Company
   993	    and Philips stores 35-mm photographs as well as text, graphics
   994	    and sound on compact discs.  It offers several benefits to
   995	    consumers and professionals:
   996	
   997	    * rapid retrieval and display of images
   998	
   999	    * consistent and optimum image quality
  1000	
  1001	    * access to powerful image manipulation
  1002	
  1003	    * access to high-quality, continuous tone printing
  1004	
  1005	    * support for a wide range of colors;
  1006	
  1007	    * image duplication without degradation
  1008	
  1009	    * support for current and future television formats
  1010	
  1011	
  1012	How much does it cost to get my film on a Photo CD?
  1013	
  1014	The average cost is around $24 for an average roll of film. One gets the
  1015	negatives, prints and a Photo CD. One should contact their local
  1016	photofinisher or Kodak for the location of the one in your area.
  1017	
  1018	The picture resolutions range from 128 x 192 to 2048 x 3072 and all 5
  1019	resolutions are in 24-bit color. How big is image of the highest
  1020	resolution?  It is around 20 megabytes in size. One can place between 100
  1021	- 150 images (PAC) on a MASTER Photo CD. Software is available on
  1022	computers that can convert these formats to a compatible graphic standard
  1023	(ie GIF, TIFF, TARGA, etc). The five picture formats that are included in
  1024	each image PAC are as follows:
  1025	
  1026	Image     Resolution
  1027	==========================
  1028	
  1029	Base/16 = 128 x 192  pixels
  1030	Base/4  = 256 x 384  pixels
  1031	Base    = 512 x 768  pixels
  1032	4Base   = 1024 x 1536  pixels
  1033	16Base  = 2048 x 3072  pixels
  1034	
  1035	In image PAC is a compressed form that includes all 5 resolutions of a
  1036	single image and ranges from 4 to 6 megabytes on average. When used in a
  1037	program, the image is decompressed so that it can be displayed.
  1038	
  1039	Stand-alone Photo CD players will play both standard audio CDs and display
  1040	Photo CD images on the television screen. Anyone will be able to enlarge
  1041	and manipulate the Photo CD images on a television to create custom Photo
  1042	CD albums with the players. Kodak's Photo CD players and Philips CD-I
  1043	players both work quite nicely.
  1044	
  1045	
  1046	For use with a CD-ROM on a computer system one needs to have the following:
  1047	
  1048	* CD-ROM/XA (mode 2 from 1 sectors) and CD-BRIDGE format compatibility
  1049	* Display system (24-bit color is recommended for best results)
  1050	* Software driver that can read/access Photo CD discs.
  1051	
  1052	In the future, Kodak Photo CD logos will be placed on compatible drives.
  1053	
  1054	
  1055	How is a photograph placed on a Photo CD?
  1056	
  1057	* KODAK PCD Film Scanner digitizes 35-mm negatives or slides. The film is
  1058	  scanned at a minimum resolution of 2048 x 3072. The three RGB values
  1059	  (primary colors Red, Green, and Blue) are given 12-bits each for color
  1060	  values.
  1061	
  1062	* Image data is encoded and color adjustments are performed in addition to
  1063	  compression. This is all done to achieve consistent, high quality
  1064	  prints. The image color is reduced to 24-bits.
  1065	
  1066	* The digitized image is then written to a Photo CD disc. It is written to
  1067	  disc via CD-Writer device.

  1103	
  1104	
  1105	One can find out more information on Photo CD by contacting
  1106	the Kodak Information Center (KIC).
  1107	
  1108	
  1109	--==-- J) What is multi-session and why is it important to Photo CD?
  1110	
  1111	Multi-Session is the ability to read more than one table of contents. One
  1112	can think of a book when thinking of table of contents. A single session
  1113	drive can only read one session. This is similar to a 10 chapter book and
  1114	only being able to read the first chapter. With multi-session, one can
  1115	read all sessions that were written at different times. If this were a
  1116	book you would be able to read all 10 chapters.
  1117	
  1118	The advantage of multi-session is being able to place photographs taken at
  1119	different times. For example if one takes pictures during summer vacation
  1120	they can be placed on a Photo CD disc. At Christmas time you take more
  1121	pictures and they can be added to the disc as well. Every time one adds a
  1122	new set of pictures to a disc it is called a session. So one can see what
  1123	a useful feature Multi-Session capability is.
  1124	
  1125	NOTE: Multi-Session works with all forms of CD-ROM data including Kodak's
  1126	      Photo CD. So having multi-session one is not limited to the types of
  1127	      data that can be added to the disc later on.

  1130	--==-- K) Interview with Scott Brownstein - Manager Advanced Projects at
  1131	          Kodak (summary of the interview)
  1132	
  1133	AD = Albert Dayes
  1134	SB = Scott Brownstein
  1135	
  1136	
  1137	AD: How long was the development process for Photo CD?
  1138	SB: Approximately 5 years.
  1139	
  1140	AD: Ending in January 1992?
  1141	SB: Yes
  1142	
  1143	AD: What computer was used for the development of Photo CD?
  1144	SB: Many different types ranging from MACs to VAX clusters to
  1145	    Sun SPARCstations, etc.
  1146	
  1147	AD: There are currently only 5 formats for Photo CD including
  1148	    Master, PRO, Catalog, Medical and Portfolio.
  1149	
  1150	NOTE: a general overview of the different formats was not part
  1151	      of the interview.
  1152	
  1153	    MASTER format has a pac format with 5 different resolutions and can
  1154	    store about 100 to 150 images.
  1155	
  1156	    PRO format which has higher resolution and supports larger film
  1157	    formats other than 35-mm. These include 70mm, 120mm and 4 x 5 inch,
  1158	    etc.
  1159	
  1160	    CATALOG format has low resolution than base images and can contain up
  1161	    to 6000 images.
  1162	
  1163	    MEDICAL format is for storing CT (Computed Tomography) and MRI
  1164	    (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) pictures in addition to standard film
  1165	    formats. It can also be used for other diagnostic scans like
  1166	    Ultrasound, PET (Positron Emission Tomographic) and Angiogram.
  1167	
  1168	    PORTFOLIO format allows the mixing of images, text and audio and
  1169	    branching capability, all on one disc. These images are base
  1170	    resolution.
  1171	
  1172	END NOTE:
  1173	
  1174	AD: How does the Catalog format work?
  1175	SB: It contains about 800 video pages and each page can have multiple
  1176	    images on it. Each image has an index and can be used to present a
  1177	    presentation. Using indexes and branching one can generate a unique
  1178	    presentation.
  1179	
  1180	    Using Kodak's Shoebox software you can find any image by using a
  1181	    keyword search. The Shoebox software works with smaller storage
  1182	    requirements all the way up to very large jukeboxes with a capability
  1183	    of over 100 Photo CD discs on-line at one time.
  1184	
  1185	AD: And the Portfolio?
  1186	SB: It allows for the mixing of text, audio and images and Kodak will have
  1187	    authoring tools out in 1993. The audio in this case can be either CD
  1188	    audio (Red Book) or ADPCM. The branching is just an access method and
  1189	    in this case interactive programmed access.
  1190	
  1191	AD: What makes the PRO format different from the MASTER format?
  1192	SB: The PRO format can use film sizes larger than 35-mm and allows for a
  1193	    max resolution of 8,000 x 12,000. It also has data encryption and
  1194	    security features. For example watermarking. Each image can be given
  1195	    its own unique key to effectively lock the image.
  1196	
  1197	    The watermark allows for the picture to display but have a message
  1198	    across it like "PROOF" or "COPYRIGHT 1992", etc. So without knowing
  1199	    the key this watermark will always be displayed on top of the image.
  1200	    Once the person uses the correct key then the watermark will be
  1201	    removed from the image being displayed.
  1202	
  1203	AD: Are images scanned at 24-bit resolution?
  1204	SB: No, they are scanned at 12-bits per RGB (Red, Green and Blue values).
  1205	    The software then compresses it to 24-bits.
  1206	
  1207	    The 24-bits is actually made up of 8-bits for luminance and the rest
  1208	    for chroma.
  1209	
  1210	AD: What is Kodak's Picture Exchange?
  1211	SB: Basically it allows people to store images on a consignment basis.
  1212	    The fees are based on storage, referral and cross platform.
  1213	
  1214	AD: How does one access Kodak's Picture Exchange?
  1215	SB: Anything with 9.6 (9600 baud) and higher can have access.
  1216	
  1217	AD: What has been the response to Photo CD?
  1218	SB: It has been extremely positive. Having cross platform capability and
  1219	    ISO-9660 helps quite a bit. In addition it reaches both the low and
  1220	    the high end with the same technology. Also with Kodak providing
  1221	    automatic scanning equipment speeds up the process of translating film
  1222	    to Photo CD discs.
  1223	
  1224	AD: What about multi-session? Are all of Kodak's Photo CD players
  1225	    multi-session?
  1226	SB: Yes all Kodak's Photo CD players are multi-session and so are CD-I
  1227	    players. The newer CD-ROM drives are also getting that capability as
  1228	    well. In addition they can all play regular audio CDs.
  1229	
  1230	AD: What about CD-WO and multi-session?
  1231	SB: This entire area of CD technology is very exciting. So instead of
  1232	    being stuck with a 100 megabyte CD you can now add to it. One can add
  1233	    any type of data because of multi-session technology. Since there is
  1234	    no blank spaces between the data after the drive reads it, it will
  1235	    think that it has just a larger CD-ROM. Normal CD-audio will not work
  1236	    since it is not part of the specification. It is a problem with audio
  1237	    CDs needing TOCs. But if the audio is recorded in the first session it
  1238	    will be fine.
  1239	
  1240	    The advantage of this technology is 1) it is WRITABLE and 2) it is
  1241	    PRESSABLE. Consider the low cost of floppy disks but then think of
  1242	    long it takes to write data to one. Once you have a CD you can just
  1243	    have them pressed. The average time to press a CD is about 4 to 6
  1244	    seconds or approximately 100 megabytes per second. It makes perfect
  1245	    distribution and duplication sense. With a recordable CD it is almost
  1246	    the same as having a 600 megabyte floppy.
  1247	
  1248	AD: What is the most important aspect of Kodak Photo CD technology?
  1249	SB: Actually there are three things:
  1250	    a) cross platform
  1251	    b) digital audio and digital video
  1252	    c) high end (PRO market) and low end (Consumer market)
  1253	
  1254	AD: Thank you
  1255	
  1256	
  1257	--==-- L) Which is the best CD-ROM drive to buy?
  1258	
  1259	First thing it must be a SCSI CD-ROM drive! If you just want to read data
  1260	disks you can buy one of the older generation drives. Make sure that the
  1261	maker of the driver software has tested your drive so you will not be
  1262	stuck when it doesn't work. In this case contact ICD or Atari. Also if you
  1263	need Photo CD compatibility you need one that is both multi-session and
  1264	CD-ROM/XA compatible. Most of these new drives are either just becoming
  1265	available or will be coming out in early 1993. Price range is under $800.
  1266	
  1267	The drivers for regular CD-ROMs are available from Atari and ICD. One
  1268	should contact either of the two companies for additional information.
  1269	
  1270	At COMDEX, in the Atari Booth the CD-ROM drive being used for Photo CD was
  1271	a Toshiba TXM3301B1. This is a single-session model and software at the
  1272	time was only single session.
  1273	
  1274	Currently the software only supports MULTI-SESSION on the TT030 and Atari
  1275	Falcon030, and only SINGLE session on the ST. It is a possibility that
  1276	multi-session capability will work on the ST in the future. Michael
  1277	Bernards wrote the driver software for Photo CD on the Atari and Calamus
  1278	SL (DTP) Photo CD access software.
  1279	
  1280	Calamus SL has an Photo CD importer that supports all five resolutions of
  1281	an image.
  1282	
  1283	One should contact the references given below for additional information
  1284	on availability of the Photo CD drivers. Kodak certifies CD-ROM drives
  1285	that are compatible with Photo CD as well. The best method is to ask on an
  1286	on-line service and consult magazines or call the Kodak Information
  1287	Center. Also consult with the maker of driver software since they usually
  1288	have a compatibility list of drives they have tested as well.
  1289	
  1290	Toshiba, Pioneer, Sony and other have stated they will have CD-ROM drives
  1291	that will support CD-ROM/XA, multi-session and Photo CD.
  1292	
  1293	The current CD-ROM/XA, multi-session Photo CD compatible drive from
  1294	Toshiba is TXM3301E1. This one is the only one currently shipping.
  1295	Upgrades from earlier versions of the TXM3301 are possible (depending on
  1296	serial number) contact Toshiba for more information.
  1297	
  1298	The year 1993 is not only the year of the Atari Falcon030 but the year of
  1299	the CD-ROM/XA multi-session CD-ROM drives. Many will be coming out all
  1300	during the 1993 year and prices are dropping!
  1301	
  1302	
  1303	RECOMMENDATION:  Buy a CD-ROM/XA multi-session SCSI drive. The cost is not
  1304	                 that much higher than normal SCSI drives and you will be
  1305	                 able to enjoy a long future with Photo CD and CD-ROM.
  1306	
  1307	Summary:
  1308	
  1309	For general use:
  1310	
  1311	1) SCSI CD-ROM drive (external)*
  1312	2) SCSI host adapter (TT030 and Atari Falcon030 have built in SCSI ports.
  1313	                     The ST family requires SCSI host adapters like
  1314	                     ICD).
  1315	3) SCSI driver software that supports CD-ROM drives. **
  1316	4) SCSI cables and power cables as needed.
  1317	
  1318	For multi-session, and Photo CD support:
  1319	
  1320	1) SCSI CD-ROM/XA, multi-session and Photo CD (external)*
  1321	2) SCSI host adapter (TT030 and Atari Falcon030 have built in SCSI ports.
  1322	                     The ST family requires SCSI host adapters like
  1323	                     ICD). ****
  1324	3) SCSI driver software that supports CD-ROM drives. **
  1325	4) SCSI driver software for Photo CD support.***
  1326	5) SCSI cables and power cables as needed.
  1327	
  1328	
  1329	* Internal drives are possible but require additional work. Contact your
  1330	  dealer for more information.
  1331	
  1332	** Be sure your CD-ROM drive has been tested with CD-ROM driver software
  1333	   before purchasing one.
  1334	
  1335	*** Be sure your CD-ROM drive has been tested with both the CD-ROM driver
  1336	    software and Photo CD software before purchasing one.
  1337	
  1338	**** The Photo CD software driver for the ST is currently single session
  1339	     only.

  1414	ISO-9660 filesystem made EASY
  1415	
  1416	
  1417	This is a very simple filesystem and it very easy to understand. The first
  1418	thing that happens it sector #16 is read. It then checks for the primary
  1419	volume descriptor.
  1420	                                     ____
  1421	1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15- |16|  <----------
  1422	                                     ----            |
  1423	                                                     |

  1427	Check sector 16 for a Primary Volume Descriptor ------
  1428	
  1429	If Sector 16 contains the Primary Volume Descriptor then jump to the root

  1431	the primary volume descriptor.

  1434	  {
  1435	   ID = "CD001";
  1436	   other information;
  1437	   location of root directory on the disc; ----
  1438	   size of root directory;                    |
  1439	   other information;                         |
  1440	  }                                           |
  1441	                                              |
  1442	                                              |

  1444	                                              |
  1445	ROOT DIRECTORY <-------------------------------
  1446	
  1447	The root directory contains the list of files and sub-directories. All
  1448	files and directories on an ISO-9660 CD-ROM are called directory records.
  1449	
  1450	Here is an example of a root directory:
  1451	
  1452	file_1.txt;1   <----- file
  1453	file_2.doc;3   <------------- file
  1454	sub_dir.;2     <----- sub directory
  1455	
  1456	If we want to examine file_1.txt;1 and we read the directory record. The
  1457	directory record indicates what sector (absolute) that the file starts on
  1458	and how long the file is in bytes.
  1459	
  1460	FILE_1.TXT;1
  1461	  {
  1462	   other information;
  1463	   location of file on the disc;-----------------
  1464	   size of the file (in bytes or characters);   |
  1465	  }                                             |
  1466	                                                |
  1467	                                                |
  1468	                                                |
  1469	                                                |
  1470	data for the file <------------------------------
  1471	
  1472	Now suppose we want to go to the sub-directory named sub_dir.;2
  1473	
  1474	SUB_DIR.;2
  1475	  {
  1476	   other information;
  1477	   location of sub directory on the disc;-----------------
  1478	   size of the sub directory (in bytes or characters);   |
  1479	  }                                                      |
  1480	                                                         |
  1481	                                                         |
  1482	data for sub directory <----------------------------------
  1483	
  1484	The data for this sub-directory is different than the file. The data is a
  1485	list of all the files and sub directories in the directory. The size of
  1486	this sub-directory is given by its length in bytes.
  1487	
  1488	An example of the data in the sub-directory;
  1489	
  1490	.     <---- current sub-directory
  1491	..    <---- parent directory of this sub-directory named sub_dir.;2
  1492	file_99.doc;1
  1493	
  1494	To read the file_99.doc;1 one uses the same method out-lined earlier to
  1495	get to file_1.txt;1.
  1496	
  1497	The question is now how do we get back to the parent directory?  We read
  1498	the ".." directory record. Then jump to the location (absolute) sector of
  1499	the current directory's parent which in this case is the root directory.
  1500	
  1501	..
  1502	  {
  1503	   other information;
  1504	   location of parent directory; ----|
  1505	   size of parent directory;         |
  1506	  }                                  |
  1507	                                     |
  1508	                                     |
  1509	parent directory data <---------------
  1510	
  1511	The parent directory is read and its contents displayed. In this case the
  1512	parent directory is the root directory.
  1513	
  1514	file_1.txt;1   <----- file
  1515	file_2.doc;3   <------------- file
  1516	sub_dir.;2     <----- sub directory
  1517	
  1518	We are back to where we started again. It is not very hard to follow it at
  1519	all. It very similar to the filesystem in our Atari and IBM PC computers,
  1520	you might have noticed.
  1521	
  1522	The filenames and sub-directory names look strange. Basically the
  1523	filenames are the same type as on the Atari. Its 8.3 format (for example
  1524	ATARI456.DOC) is very familiar. There is some extra characters on the end
  1525	and they add a version number. For example on some computers like
  1526	Digital's VAX every time you save the file the version number is updated.
  1527	
  1528	For Example:
  1529	
  1530	file.dat;1
  1531	
  1532	save the file again
  1533	
  1534	file.dat;2     <----- version number is updated after the file is saved.
  1535	
  1536	Other than a few small things, ISO-9660 and the Atari filesystem are very
  1537	similar. As one can see the ISO-9660 CD-ROM filesystem is even simpler
  1538	than the normal Atari filesystems. For more technical details on the
  1539	ISO-9660 standard one needs to buy the ISO-9660 specification since it is
  1540	copyrighted by ISO.

  1547	When the CD-ROM drive first spins up it checks for the presence of a TOC
  1548	(table of contents) on the CD. This gives information about how big the
  1549	disc is in general terms. The first TOC is always in the same location so
  1550	all CD-ROM drives and Audio CD players check for its presence everytime
  1551	they are turned on.

  1553	With Multi-Session the entire disc has to be checked to see if more than
  1554	one session exists. The disc has a beginning and ending for each session
  1555	on the disc. So on a multi-session disc there will be several TOCs and
  1556	beginning and ending sections one for each session. The beginning and
  1557	ending sections are usually referred to lead in and lead out.
  1558	
  1559	LI = (lead in) beginning
  1560	LO = (lead out) end
  1561	TOC = Table Of Contents (which is actually part of the lead in section)

  1583	Who says CD-ROM/XA multi-session drives tell the truth?
  1584	
  1585	The CD-ROM/XA multi-session drive looks at a disc and reads the first
  1586	Table Of Contents. The software driver asks if the CD-ROM/XA
  1587	multi-session drive has found the end yet. The CD-ROM drive lies and says
  1588	no and continues searching until it finds the last TOC on the disc. The
  1589	CD-ROM/XA multi-session drive replies with a YES when has found the last
  1590	session on the disc.
  1591	
  1592	The best part about a multi-session is that one can add data at any time
  1593	whenever one needs to. It will be a great way to make updates to the
  1594	family album using a Photo CD disc as one's album. So many possibilities
  1595	and all available on the Atari too.

  1599	Making My OWN CD-ROM made EASY
  1600	
  1601	Walnut Creek provides a service to make a master CD-ROM for only $200.
  1602	They will take 600 megabytes on TAPE or floppies. Yes floppies disks are
  1603	accepted provided they are in MS-DOS format. Strange thing is Atari format
  1604	is the same as MS-DOS format. Does that give any one any ideas? <HINT,
  1605	HINT>
  1606	
  1607	And with a Multi-Session CD-ROM/XA drive you can always add more data
  1608	later on to the disc.

  1612	An Atari Dream CD-ROM
  1613	
  1614	A dream CD-ROM for me would be to have all the articles in STart, ST-LOG,
  1615	ST-Applications, and Antic all on one CD-ROM. Just think all of those
  1616	articles and program listings in the palm of your hand.
  1617	
  1618	It is not very fun searching through many STart magazines looking for that
  1619	great David Small article on the floppy disc controller (STart magazine
  1620	Fall 1987, I think?). All those great programming articles in one place...
  1621	WOW!  A CD-ROM would be perfect.
  1622	
  1623	Just think of being able to look up all past reviews from all the
  1624	different magazines in one place. A hint ... CD-ROM would be nice! Trying
  1625	to remember which magazine which they built a hard drive in... you could
  1626	search for it in seconds on a CD-ROM. Just think - complete text files and
  1627	Degas pictures for the diagrams too.
  1628	
  1629	Remember something David Small said at one of his shows? "I want my
  1630	MAC-ST!" How about a new one.

  1691	              chips. A glass master is "cut" using a laser; one or more
  1692	              negative nickel stampers are made; and those are used to

  1720	              interface card.
  1721	SERVER      = In very general terms... "back end" (provides services to
  1722	              a client). Usually thought of in a client-server type of

  1725	              for tagging text structures with generic identifiers
  1726	              which mark the category or class to which a piece of
  1727	              text belongs. (ISO 8879, 1986)
  1728	SINGLE SESSION = The ability to read one TOC (table of contents) or one
  1729	                 session. All CD-ROM drives generally fall into this
  1730	                 category. Usually made in reference to Photo CD.
  1731	TOC         = Table of Contents (similar to the table of contents found
  1732	              in a book). All CDs have one or more of them. This also

  1737	              USL (Unix System Laboratories) are in charge of promoting
  1738	              and enhancing the UNIX standard.
  1739	WORM        = Write Once Read Many device. You can only write to one
  1740	              area on the disc once but you can read it many, many times.

  2065	
  2066	The difference between the two forms is the file flag byte moved to account
  2067	for an additional byte of date and time used for a Greenwich mean time
  2068	offset. See the May 28th draft of the High Sierra proposal or ISO-9660 for a
  2069	more complete explanation of the fields. Note that the C structs above are
  2070	not syntactically correct; C does not allow variable length arrays as struct
  2071	elements.
  2072	
  2073	
  2074	Choice of Filename Characters
  2075	
  2076	On the first Microsoft Test CD-ROM disc, the Codeview demo failed because
  2077	certain filename characters that were legal on MS-DOS were not allowed
  2078	according to the High Sierra file format. When the software looked for file
  2079	'S1.@@@', it wasn't found because the character '@' is illegal for High
  2080	Sierra filenames and during High Sierra premastering, the file was renamed
  2081	'S1'.
  2082	
  2083	Valid High Sierra filename characters are the letters 'A' through 'Z', the
  2084	digits '0' through '9', and the underscore character '_'. All other
  2085	characters are invalid. Note that the letters 'a' through 'z' are not
  2086	included so that High Sierra file names are not case sensitive. Under DOS,
  2087	filenames are mapped to upper case before they are looked up so this is
  2088	typically not a problem. When choosing file name characters, keep in mind
  2089	the restrictions of the file structure format and the operating systems your
  2090	media may be targeted towards.
  2091	
  2092	
  2093	Depth of Path
  2094	
  2095	The High Sierra format allows for pathnames to be up to 8 levels deep. It's
  2096	possible to create a path on MS-DOS that is deeper than that but you won't
  2097	be able to transfer it to a CD-ROM.
  2098	
  2099	  \one\two\three\four\five\six\seven\eight\file.txt /* Ok */
  2100	  \one\two\three\four\five\six\seven\eight\nine\file.txt /* Illegal */
  2101	
  2102	
  2103	Length of Path
  2104	
  2105	The High Sierra format allows for the entire pathname to be a maximum of 255
  2106	characters. Since MS-DOS imposes a limit far lower than this, this should
  2107	not present a problem. The MS-DOS call to connect to a sub-directory is
  2108	limited to a directory string of 64 characters. The length of path
  2109	restriction is more a concern for Xenix/Unix than MS-DOS.
  2110	
  2111	Amusingly enough, the MS-DOS call to create a sub-directory allows a
  2112	directory string greater than 64 characters which allows you to create sub-
  2113	directories that you cannot connect to.
  2114	
  2115	Unfortunately, a CD-ROM may potentially contain a pathname that is much
  2116	larger than 64 characters long. This is not a concern here but is discussed
  2117	in a related memo - "MS-DOSifying your CD-ROM". As a rule, try to keep the
  2118	length of your longest path less than 64 characters and you should be pretty
  2119	safe.
