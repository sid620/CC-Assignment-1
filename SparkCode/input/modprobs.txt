    22	Some people have experienced trouble (typically, being 'dumped' in mid-
    23	transmission) with some systems yet have not had similar problems with others.
    24	The natural thing is to blame the system BUT before you do, read the following
    25	information. You may be surprised that there could be a very simple cure for
    26	your problem:-
    27	 
    28	 
    29	The various telephone companies have been offering a useful service called
    30	'Call Waiting' which for practical purposes gives you two phone lines on one
    31	phone.  In other words, if you are on the phone, and someone else calls you,
    32	they hear a 'ring' instead of getting a busy signal.  You (but not the person
    33	you are presently talking to) hear a momentary 'beep' to tell you that
    34	another call is waiting and you can then answer their call by momentarily
    35	depressing the hook-switch which puts the current caller 'on hold' while you
    36	talk to the new caller.  You can switch back and forth between callers also by
    37	momentarily depressinmg the hook-switch each time.
    38	 
    39	This is a great service, BUT IT HAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR MODEM USERS! That
    40	'beep' you hear to signal that another call is waiting ALSO momentarily
    41	'blacks out' the audio...  and if it is a modem at the other end, yours or the
    42	other end, will think it has lost carrier for that brief duration, and it MAY
    43	DISCONNECT, depending on the terminal software and/or modem types involved!
    44	Fortunately, there is a cure for this problem within another service, 'Call
    45	Forwarding' that the phone company usually offers in a package deal with the
    46	'Call Waiting', and this method DOES work!
    47	 
    48	NOTE: There is mis-information being circulated to the effect that Call
    49	      Waiting can be disabled by a simple user code *70 or 1170.  This
    50	      comes from a hackers BBS in the USA and may work there, but it does
    51	      DOES NOT WORK here!
    52	 
    53	This service allows you to 'forward' calls coming in for you, to another phone
    54	number that you can enter whenever you activate the service.  Once forwarded,
    55	your phone rings a 'half ring' once only on every call forwarded to the
    56	number you have entered, just to remind you that your line is 'on forwarding'.
    57	Your line can then be used for outgoing calls WITHOUT causing a 'busy' to the
    58	forwarded calls!
    59	 
    60	Now the interesting point... once on forwarding, your outgoing calls are no
    61	longer interrupted in any manner, so your modem calls will now, not be
    62	affected.  You must, however, originate the call since incoming calls are now
    63	forwarded to another number AND YOU CAN'T ACCESS THEM.  If you don't have a
    64	second line in the house to forward to, (whereupon, you could still answer the
    65	forwarded calls) you can also 'forward' calls to your own number, which will
    66	then ring 'busy' to anyone calling you WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE ON THE LINE.
    67	If you are not using the line, it will do a 'half ring' everytime someone
    68	attempts to reach you to remind you that your line is 'on forwarding'.
    69	A simple code entered to the phone line disconnects forwarding and all becomes
    70	normal again.
    71	 
    72	     Some troubles of the 'I got dumped' variety can be traced to carrier
    73	levels that are too low, either at the sending end (yours!) or the receiving
    74	end (the system you are calling).  Remember that there is a telephone line
    75	between that does have a variable amount of signal loss depending how many
    76	exchanges the call passes before reaching the desired destination.  You don't
    77	have any control over this aspect, but it seems that people who operate from a
    78	Touch Tone equipped line do consistantly better than those who have a simple
    79	'basic black' dial telephone service!  The reason, it appears, is that Touch
    80	Tone lines are more carefully controlled than the dial pulse lines, and hence
    81	they are more consistant.
    82	 
    83	Another common problem appears in acoustic coupled modems.  Those are the ones
    84	where you stuff the handset into an earmuff type of receptacle after you dial
    85	and hear a carrier being sent to you by the system you have called).
    86	Your telephone mouthpiece can suffer from 'compacted carbon granules' which is
    87	the modem users equivalent of going deaf in both ears!  In a word, the
    88	mouthpiece becomes insensitive to sound and the distant end hears a low level
    89	carrier.  There is a quick and easy cure for this, but unfortunately it only
    90	works with the older model 500 type telephones which use a carbon type of
    91	microphone.  Simply unscrew the mouthpiece and remove the little round capsule
    92	(it will fall out into your hand) and rap it sharply a few times around its
    93	perimeter and replace it.  This will shake loose the carbon granules and make
    94	for better transmission levels.
    95	 
    96	In some cases, with lower speed modems (110 - 300 baud) it is possible to have
    97	undesirable differences in your modem mark and space tones, thus making the
    98	receiving end modem appear deaf to yours, or your modem putting out a lower
    99	level than is needed, making your operation mariginal, subject to the small
   100	variations in amplitude of one telephone line vs another. In some of the
   101	cheap modems, these are very real problems because the manufacturer can't pay
   102	attention to these matters without raising the price substantially.  This is
   103	partly the reason why good modems cost money.
   104	 
   105	If you have a frequency counter and audio generator available, you can check
   106	your low speed send and receive frequencies from the following list:-
   107	 
   108	 
   109	   ORIGINATE MODE:  MARK  = 1270 Hz
   110	   ==============   SPACE = 1070 Hz
   111	      (YOU)
   112	 
   113	 
   114	   ANSWER MODE:     MARK  = 2225 Hz
   115	   ===========      SPACE = 2025 Hz
   116	    (SYSTEM)
   117	 
   118	 
   119	You can see that there is only 200 Hz difference between the MARK and SPACE
   120	frequencies and only 755 Hz between the originate and answer filters.  This
   121	means that the filters MUST be accurate and that very little variance can be
   122	tolerated.
   123	 
   124	 
   125	Another possible problem, but less likely, is a mis-match of word length, stop
   126	bits and parity check or no parity check in the coding your modem sends to the
   127	system you are calling.  Most systems default to 8N1 or 8 bit words, no parity
   128	and one stop bit to make up each information transfer 'word' that the system
   129	deals with.  If your equipment isn't set to match this format, then you should
   130	adjust your settings to conform.
   131	 
   132	 
   133	An insideously subtle problem is the possibility of YOUR LOCATION being
   134	responsible for revealing an apparent fault in the design of your modem, which
   135	the supplier may not know about, or even think about, when trying to duplicate
   136	the fault conditions under testing.  This can be caused by you being in close
   137	proximity to an A.M. broadcast transmitting station (in the case of low
   138	frequencies) and paging, F.M. or T.V. Broadcast or other 'common carrier'
   139	service transmitters (in the case of high frequencies).
   140	By way of an example, in one case a modem user was close (within a few miles)
   141	to a 50,000 watt A.M. radio station transmitter which operates on 1010 kHz.
   142	His modem was constantly acting up at his home, but worked OK at his office
   143	much further away from the transmitter. The tip off was that he could hear
   144	music and voice on his telephone line corresponding to the programs on the
   145	station and, of course, this should not be happening to any self-respecting
   146	telephone.
   147	 
   148	A complaint call to the Phone Repair Service got a service man to install
   149	surpressors, at no charge, curing the music and spurious talk problem.  The
   150	modem, however, was still acting up, although substantially less than before
   151	the Phone Companys fix was applied.  This now confirmed the fact that the
   152	entire problem was due to 'Rectification' or 'Break Through' of the radio
   153	signal into the audio circuits of the modem.  There are various ways this can
   154	be 'cured' but they all boil down to the necessity of locating the stage where
   155	the rectification is taking place and eliminating it at that point.  There is
   156	usually only one place in the circuit where the problem originates and it most
   157	frequently is a high gain stage like a preamplifier or an active filter.
   158	'Shot-in-the-dark' band-aid fixes usually only reduce the problem, but don't
   159	eliminate it, where proper diagnostic techniques applied will result in a
   160	complete fix for the problem.
   161	 
   162	 
   163	More recently, with the advent of higher speed modems that use complex
   164	algorithms to code the data, there are problems with line noise that did not
   165	appear to substantially affect the slower speed modems. There is a lot
   166	of comment regarding 'line noise' and related problems, but there is also a
   167	great deal of mystery surrounding the mechanism of how and where the noise
   168	originates and what the user can do about it, if anything.
   169	 
   170	Noise will usually take the form of short 'impulse' or clicking noises and
   171	longer crackling or 'static' noises.  The effect of the noise can be directly
   172	seen on your monitor and gives a clue to the type of noise and its probable
   173	origin.  The following quote from the Hayes Smartmodem 1200 Owners Manual
   174	shows what happens when noise corrupts data transmission:-
   175	 
   176	   "If an error occurs or a data bit is lost at the low speed (300 baud), the
   177	    result on the terminal screen or printer is a single error - either an
   178	    incorrect or missing character.  The same error at the high speed (1200
   179	    baud) is multiplied, however, due to the path that characters take before
   180	    being output for printing or display.  At least two and often three
   181	    characters are incorrect as a result of a single bit error.  The
   182	    descrambling algorithm alters the data so that an error is often produced
   183	    as a left brace '{' or a lower case letter 'i'.  Do not interpret this to
   184	    be a hardware defect."
   185	 
   186	The impulse noise will often produce the single bit error described above,
   187	however, if the problem encountered is a 'burst' of anywhere from a few to ten
   188	or more characters, you can assume that you are plagued with the 'static'
   189	noise variety.
   190	 
   191	There is an alternate path selection used by the phone company for local and
   192	long distance call completion.  The equipment tries to complete the call a few
   193	different ways by 'Alternate Routing' through other available central offices
   194	if it finds trunks to the desired end office are busy, before it abandons the
   195	call and gives you a fast (trunk busy) busy signal.  Alternate routing MAY
   196	run your call through an older, noisy office, and hence one possible answer to
   197	why hanging-up and redialing often gets you a better line!
   198	 
   199	The cause of the noise determines the type of noise, and in the phone company
   200	central office, some impulse noise is produced by older switching equipment.
   201	If your call to a system is routed through one of these older offices, chances
   202	are it may pick up some of this impulse noise.  Natural phenomenon such as
   203	static discharges and lightning contribute to this as well as man made noise
   204	from electrical switching circuits that may induce impulse noise into the
   205	nearby phone line anywhere along the way.  These problems are usually minimal
   206	because the phone lines are balanced to ground and thus tend to cancel this
   207	kind of common-mode noise.
   208	 
   209	One very likely cause of the 'static' variety of noise is the 'line protector
   210	block' which is installed at every phone line terminating location.  It is
   211	designed to be a surge protector for lightning etc., and it has carbon fuse
   212	elements in it which have been known to become noisy.  The problems caused
   213	are not consistant because the higher ringing voltage and normal switching
   214	transients when you pick up your line will clear the problem temporarily, for
   215	minutes, hours, days or maybe even months!
   216	 
   217	If you experience the 'static' problem described, then a call to the telephone
   218	repair service is in order.  Simply tell them you are hearing loud static
   219	noises on your line which sometimes go away if you bounce the switch-hook up
   220	and down a few times and you suspect the line protector block is defective
   221	and would like it replaced.  Don't mention modems or computers or they
   222	will start suggesting that you get an expensive data line which isn't needed!
   223	Just make sure that you remove any and all attachments that aren't approved
   224	when the phone company employee comes to do the job, just to avoid any likely
   225	problems with them complaining that you were the cause and not their line.
   226	 
   227	Come to think of it, are you SURE you, or equipment that you have connected to
   228	the line, are NOT the cause of your problems?  If the noise goes away when you
   229	have all your gadgets disconnected, then one of them is the cause, and not the
   230	phone company supplied equipment.
