   241	A Note on Communications Software
   242	
   243	If you're using a computer rather than a terminal, you need communications 
   244	software.  Many brands are available, all of which are based on the modem's 
   245	AT command set. Some users prefer their communications software to take 
   246	control of the modem, and are more comfortable with a program that makes 
   247	the modem almost transparent.   Others prefer a program that allows them to 
   248	use the modem's AT command set sometimes, and their software at other times, 
   249	depending on the task at hand.  Review at least Chapter 4 so that you have a 
   250	basic understanding of the modem's requirements and operation. 
   251

   346	************************
   347	For Canadian Modem Users
   348	The Industry Canada (formerly DOC) label identifies certified equipment.  
   349	This certification means that the equipment meets certain telecommunications 
   350	network protective, operational, and safety requirements.  The department 
   351	does not guarantee the equipment will operate to a user's satisfaction.
   352	Before installing this equipment, make sure you are permitted to connect it 
   353	to the facilities of the local telecommunications company.  You must also 
   354	install the equipment using an acceptable method of connection.  In some 
   355	cases, you may also extend the company's inside wiring for single line 
   356	individual service by means of a certified connector assembly (telephone 
   357	extension cord).  You should be aware, however, that compliance with the 
   358	above conditions may not prevent degradation of service in some situations.
   359	Repairs to certified equipment should be made by an authorized Canadian 
   360	maintenance facility designated by the supplier.  Any repairs or alterations 
   361	made by a user to this equipment, or equipment malfunctions, may give the 
   362	telecommunications company cause to request the user to disconnect the

   383	
   384	************
   385	INTRODUCTION
   386	Congratulations!  The Courier modem you've purchased represents powerful, 
   387	advanced electronic design that offers exceptional reliability, 
   388	compatibility and flexibility at all standard rates up to 28,800 or 
   389	28.8K bits per second (bps).  The transmission rate between the computer 
   390	and modem, depending on your equipment and software support, can be as 
   391	high as 115.2K bps.
   392	
   393	********
   394	Features
   395	The following features and capabilities assure you of superior reliability 
   396	and performance.
   397	
   398	Connections up to 28.8K bps
   399	With the V.34 standard and the V.Fast Class modulation scheme, two modems 
   400	can connect at rates up to 28.8K bps, twice as fast as the rates of standard 
   401	ITU-T (formerly CCITT) V.32 bis modems, which are limited to calls of 14.4K 
   402	bps or less.
   403	
   404	Software Upgrades
   405	Courier high speed modems are now software upgradable, allowing you quick, 
   406	easy access to the latest advances in data communication technology.  See 
   407	Appendix I.
   408	
   409	Quick Connect
   410	In V.32 terbo mode, Courier high speed modems can handshake and start 
   411	transmitting much faster than typical training times that range between 
   412	9 and 18 seconds for other modems.
   413	
   414	Universal Connect
   415	Courier high speed modems automatically detect and connect at the fastest 
   416	available speed.
   417	
   418	Adaptive Speed Leveling (ASL)
   419	Like most high speed modems, Courier modems fall back to the next lower 
   420	speed—for example, 19.2K, then 16.8K in V.terbo mode--if poor line conditions 
   421	warrant.  In addition, Courier V.32 bis, and V.32 terbo modems detect 
   422	improved line conditions and shift upward again to the next higher speed.  
   423	Both transmit and receive channels adapt independently, each detecting and 
   424	adjusting to line conditions.  ASL keeps the modems online, always operating 
   425	at the highest possible speed, and constantly ensuring data integrity.
   426	
   427	Fax Capability
   428	You can use your modem with Class 1 or Class 2.0 facsimile software to 
   429	exchange faxes with millions of Group III fax machines worldwide.  See 
   430	Chapter 5.
   431	
   432	Error Control--V.42/MNP
   433	Data integrity is ensured when the modems connect with remote modems that 
   434	use the V.42 (LAPM), HST, or MNP error control protocols.  Error control is 
   435	available on calls at 1200 bps and above.
   436	
   437	Data Compression--V.42 bis/MNP5
   438	Data compression enables potential throughput of up to 115.2K bps on 28.8K  
   439	bps connections.  Couriers connecting under V.42 or HST error control use 
   440	V.42 bis compression.  Couriers connecting under MNP error control use 
   441	MNP Level 5 compression.  Typical throughput of text and other types of 
   442	files using V.42 bis is provided in Appendix A.  
   443	
   444	Flow Control/Variable Serial Port Rates 
   445	Flow control, required under error control, also allows the local serial 
   446	port (DTE) rate to be set higher than the link (connection) rate, enabling 
   447	greater efficiency and throughput.  If your equipment and software support 
   448	high rates, data can be sent from the computer to the modem at 115.2K, 
   449	57.6K, 38.4K or 19.2K bps, regardless of the link rate.
   450	
   451	Voice/Data Switch
   452	A switch on the modem's front panel allows you to change from voice to data 
   453	and back again, without issuing a command.  See Appendix G.
   454	
   455	Stored Command String
   456	If you don't ordinarily use voice and data in the same call, you can assign 
   457	the voice/data switch a different function that normally requires a command, 
   458	such as resetting the modem or executing a stored command string.  See 
   459	Voice/Data in Appendix G for instructions on use of the voice/data switch. 
   460	
   461	Asynchronous/Synchronous Capability 
   462	Courier high speed modems operate synchronously as well as asynchronously.  
   463	A personal computer equipped with a synchronous interface adapter can call 
   464	computers that use standard synchronous protocols.  See Appendix F for more 
   465	information.
   466	
   467	Synchronous Operations with V.25 bis
   468	Used with computers that have a synchronous card and port, Courier high speed 
   469	modems combine the power of older modems and automatic calling units in the 
   470	mainframe environment.  They make synchronous connections by utilizing V.25 
   471	bis, character-oriented (similar to BISYNC) and HDLC protocols.  See 
   472	Appendix F for more information.
   473	
   474	Dial Security
   475	With Dial Security, you will be able to prevent unauthorized access to a 
   476	system with the use of Autopass, Prompting, and Dialback.  See Appendix D 
   477	for more information.
   478	
   479	Programmable Nonvolatile Memory
   480	You can tailor your own default settings and store them in nonvolatile 
   481	random access memory (NVRAM).  Each time the Courier is powered on or reset, 
   482	it operates at the settings you've specified.  See Chapter 4, Appendix B, 
   483	and Appendix C.
   484	
   485	Link Rate Negotiation
   486	The Courier automatically lowers its link rate to match a lower rate of a 
   487	remote modem, in both Originate and Answer Modes, allowing connections with 
   488	a wide range of installed modems.
   489	
   490	Link Diagnostics
   491	After each call, you can display a Link Diagnostics screen containing 
   492	information about the last call, including the number of data characters 
   493	transferred, line statistics, the call's rate and the reason the call was 
   494	disconnected.  See Chapter 6.
   495	
   496	Modem Diagnostics
   497	ITU-T V.54 loopback testing with the &T command options, and earlier Courier 
   498	Register S16 test options are available.  The modem performs three loopback 
   499	tests:  analog, digital, and remote digital.  See Appendix H for information.
   500	
   501	Inactivity Timer
   502	You can set the modem to automatically hang up after a specified number of 
   503	minutes if there is no activity on the phone line.  See Register S19 in 
   504	Appendix B.
   505	
   506	Call Duration Reporting
   507	The modem records the duration of your calls in hours, minutes, and seconds.  
   508	This feature enables you to display and print an audit of your calling 
   509	activities.  You can optionally use the modem clock as a real-time clock.  
   510	See the I3 and I6 screens in Chapter 6 and the K command in Chapter 4 and 
   511	Appendix C.
   512	
   513	Call Progress Detection
   514	An optional set of result codes (screen messages) lets you know when a 
   515	line is busy, a person rather than a modem has answered the phone, there 
   516	is no dial tone, or the distant phone is ringing.
   517	
   518	Modem Settings Displays
   519	On command, the modem displays its current settings, a handy way to check 
   520	your transmission rate, S-Registers and other operational controls.  The 
   521	modem also displays the defaults stored in nonvolatile memory as well as 
   522	its default configuration templates.  See Chapter 6.
   523	
   524	HELP Screens
   525	The modem displays screens that summarize the command sets, Dial command 
   526	options, and S-Register functions.  See Chapter 6.
   527	
   528	Bottom Panel Reference
   529	Command summaries and other information are printed on the bottom of the 
   530	modem case.  A Dual In-Line Package (DIP) switch guide makes it easy to 
   531	tailor the switch settings to your terminal or software requirements. 
   532	
   533	Dialing the Last-Dialed Number
   534	The modem has a buffer that stores each dialed number until it is cleared 
   535	by another Dial command.  A few keystrokes cause the modem to redial the 
   536	number in the buffer without your having to enter the number again.  See 
   537	the DL command in Appendix C.
   538	
   539	Automated Redialing 
   540	You can put the modem into Repeat Mode to continuously redial if a previous 
   541	dial attempt fails to connect.  This is especially useful in dialing 
   542	services whose lines are often busy.  See Chapter 4.
   543	
   544	Quote Mode
   545	Set the modem to Quote Mode if you want it to dial an alphabetic acronym 
   546	instead of a numeric number.  See Chapter 4.
   547

   621	Calls section in Appendix G.  
   622	
   623	Volume Control
   624	This is a slide switch underneath the right side panel of the modem, near 
   625	the front corner.  Sliding it toward the front of the modem increases the 
   626	modem speaker's volume; sliding it toward the rear of the modem decreases

   639	*  A Quick-Reference card
   640	
   641	*************
   642	What You Need
   643	The Courier modem has minimal operational requirements.  Be sure to read the 
   644	information in the front of this manual about radio and television 
   645	interference and connecting to the phone company.  In addition, you should 
   646	be aware of the following requirements.
   647	
   648	An RS-232 Cable
   649	You need an RS-232 cable to connect the modem to your computer or terminal.  
   650	Use a shielded cable to ensure minimal interference with radio and 
   651	television reception.  
   652	
   653	NOTES:  
   654	*  Refer to Appendix B for a listing of RS-232 pin assignments required to 
   655	   operate the modem.  Be sure to check the appendix if you're not sure what 
   656	   type of cable you need, or if you're building your own.  
   657	*  If your machine has other than a 25- or 9-pin port, check your computer 
   658	   documentation or consult your dealer to find out what type of RS-232 
   659	   connector is required. 
   660	
   661	WARNING:  If you're planning to use the high speed computer-to-modem rates 
   662	of 115.K, 57.6K or 38.4K bps, follow the instructions concerning the RS-232 
   663	cable in Appendix B.  The guidelines there will help you to avoid signal 
   664	degradation at very high speeds. 
   665	
   666	Communications Software. . .   
   667	. . .if the modem is attached to a computer instead of a terminal.
   668	The software uses the modem's AT command set to control many communications 
   669	functions, including configuring the modem, dialing, and answering calls, and 
   670	also enables the transfer of files and other operations.
   671	
   672	Some users prefer their communications software to take control of the 
   673	modem, and are more comfortable with a program that makes the modem almost 
   674	transparent.   Others prefer a program that allows them to use the modem's 
   675	AT command set sometimes, and their software at other times, depending on 
   676	the task at hand. 
   677	
   678	Review Chapter 4 so that you have a basic understanding of the modem's 
   679	requirements and operation. 
   680	
   681	Telephone Adapter. . . 
   682	. . .if you have an older telephone installation that does not have the 
   683	appropriate modular wall jack and plug.  
   684	
   685	Adapters and RJ11C connectors are available from your telephone company or 
   686	computer dealer.
   687	
   688	***************
   689	You Should. . .
   690	
   691	Refer to Appendix F. . . 
   692	. . .if your phone line is user-installed or if it is leased from the 
   693	telephone company.
   694	
   695	Refer to Appendix G. . .
   696	. . . if your modem is installed in a Hewlett Packard system that uses the 
   697	Ack/Enq communications protocol.
   698	
   699	********************
   700	Installing the Modem 
   701	
   702	1. Turn off the computer or terminal and its peripheral devices.
   703	
   704	2. Examine the label on the bottom of the modem.  In addition to the 
   705	   summaries and other information, the label contains icons to aid in 
   706	   modem installation.
   707	
   708	3. Make sure that the modem's power switch is OFF; press it towards the zero 
   709	   in the 0/1 icon on the bottom label.  
   710	
   711	4. Plug the power supply adapter's small connector into the power jack at 
   712	   the back of the modem.  Plug the adapter into a standard 115-volt AC 
   713	   wall socket.
   714	
   715	5. Disconnect your present phone cable from the wall jack.  Plug one end of 
   716	   the supplied phone cable into the modem's phone jack (refer to the bottom 
   717	   label).  Plug the other end into the wall jack.
   718	
   719	   If you want to keep your telephone connected for conventional calls, plug 
   720	   its cord into the modem's telephone jack (refer to the bottom label). 
   721	
   722	6. Check the positions of the bank of Dual In-Line Package (DIP) Switches 
   723	   located in the well at the bottom of the modem.  These switches are set 
   724	   at the factory to the positions most users require.  
   725	
   726	   Check your software documentation for its requirements, particularly for 
   727	   DIP switches 1, 4, 5 and 6.  You'll also find descriptions of switch 
   728	   functions and options in Appendix B.
   729	
   730	   NOTE:  If you have built your own RS-232 cable and it does not support the 
   731	   Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal, set DIP switch 1 ON, for DTR override.  
   732	   The override causes the modem to operate as if the DTR signal were always 
   733	   ON, and enables the modem to accept commands.  Most purchased communications 
   734	   software, however, requires normal DTR.
   735	
   736	7. The final step is to connect the modem to the computer's or terminal's 
   737	   serial port with the RS-232 cable.  Attach the appropriate connectors to 
   738	   the modem and to the serial port.
   739	
   740	************************
   741	Testing the Installation
   742	
   743	Use the following procedures to verify that your modem is working properly.
   744	
   745	1. Turn on your computer or terminal.  Then turn the Courier's power switch 
   746	   ON.  The following front panel indicators, or LEDs, will light up on the 
   747	   modem. 
   748	      
   749	      CD   Carrier Detect, if you have set DIP switch 6 ON, enabling the 
   750		   CD override
   751	      TR   Data Terminal Ready, if you have set DIP switch 1 ON, enabling 
   752		   the DTR override
   753	      MR   Modem Ready/Power ON
   754	      CS   Clear to Send
   755	
   756	2. If you're using a personal computer, load your software to start the 
   757	   program.  Set your terminal or software to 19.2K bps or 9600 bps.  
   758	   In addition, set a word length of either 7 bits plus 1 parity bit, or 
   759	   8 bits with no parity—it doesn't matter which at this time—and 1 Stop bit.  
   760	   Set the software to use the correct serial port (port through which the 
   761	   modem connects to the computer).
   762	
   763	3. Perform the function that lets you send AT commands to the modem, that is, 
   764	   puts the computer in Terminal mode.  Some communications programs do 
   765	   this automatically upon loading.  Others require you to display a 
   766	   communications or terminal screen, type a Function key, or perform some 
   767	   other operation.
   768	
   769	   Review your communications software documentation for instructions. 
   770	   
   771	4. Send the following attention command.  Type either upper or lower case 
   772	   letters, not a combination, and then press the Enter (Carriage Return) 
   773	   key, shown in the example below between angle brackets.  (Don't type the 
   774	   angle brackets.)
   775	
   776	       AT <Enter>
   777	
   778	  If everything is correct, the modem responds as follows:
   779	
   780	       OK
   781	
   782	   Go on to step 5.
   783	
   784	   Troubleshooting
   785	   If your entered command is not displayed, your local echo is OFF.  To 
   786	   turn the local echo ON, send the modem the following command:  
   787	      
   788	      ATE1 <Enter>
   789	   
   790	   If double characters appear on the screen, both your modem and software 
   791	   are set to local echo ON.  Either set your software to local echo OFF, 
   792	   or turn the modem's echo OFF with the following command:
   793	      
   794	      ATE0 <Enter>
   795	
   796	   If no OK appears on your screen after you completed Step 4, review the 
   797	   following checkpoints:
   798	
   799	   a. Make sure you type all upper or lower case letters and press <Enter>.
   800	   b. Check to see that you set your communications software to the correct 
   801	      serial port.  The correct serial port is the port through which the 
   802	      modem is connected to the computer.
   803	   c. Make sure your software has put the computer in Terminal mode, so that 
   804	      you can send the modem commands.  Then review Step 4, on the previous 
   805	      page.
   806	   d. Be sure that DIP switches 1 and 6 are set ON or OFF according to your 
   807	      terminal or software requirements.  The table in Appendix B explains 
   808	      each function, and you may also need to review your terminal or 
   809	      communications software documentation.
   810	   e. If you set DIP switch 8 OFF, for Dumb mode, reset the modem to Smart 
   811	      mode:  set DIP switch 8 to ON.
   812	   f. The modem is shipped with DIP switch 3 ON, enabling the result codes.  
   813	   
   814	      If DIP switch 3 is OFF, set it to the ON position.  Then initiate the 
   815	      new switch setting with the following reset command:
   816	       
   817		  ATZ <Enter>
   818	
   819	5. As a final check, make sure the modem gets a dial tone.  Type the 
   820	   following Dial command:
   821	       
   822	       ATD <Enter>
   823	
   824	   On receipt of the command, the modem goes off hook and waits for a dial 
   825	   tone.  The OH indicator lights up, and you'll hear the dial tone from 
   826	   the modem's speaker.  To cancel the operation, press any key.
   827	
   828	   Troubleshooting
   829	   If you don't hear the dial tone, first increase the volume by sliding the 
   830	   volume control switch towards the front of the modem.  If that doesn't 
   831	   work, check to see that the phone cable from the wall jack is connected to 
   832	   the correct jack on the modem (See Figure 2.3).  If necessary, reconnect 
   833	   the phone cable correctly.  Then try the Dial command again, ATD <Enter>.

   854	Communications Software. . .   
   855	. . .if the modem is attached to a computer instead of a terminal.
   856	The software uses the modem's AT command set to control many communications 
   857	functions, including configuring the modem, dialing, and answering calls, 
   858	and also enables the transfer of files and other operations.
   859	
   860	Some users prefer their communications software to take control of the 
   861	modem, and are more comfortable with a program that makes the modem almost 
   862	transparent.   Others prefer a program that allows them to use the modem's 
   863	AT command set sometimes, and their software at other times, depending on 
   864	the task at hand. 
   865	
   866	Review Chapter 4 so that you have a basic understanding of the modem's 
   867	requirements and operation. 
   868	
   869	A Telephone Adapter. . . 
   870	. . .if you have an older telephone installation that does not have the 
   871	appropriate modular wall jack and plug.  
   872	
   873	Adapters and RJ11C connectors are available from your telephone company or 
   874	computer dealer.
   875	
   876	***************
   877	You Should. . .
   878	
   879	Refer to Appendix F. . . 
   880	. . .if your phone line is user-installed or if it is leased from the 
   881	telephone company.
   882	
   883	Refer to Appendix G. . .
   884	. . . if your modem is installed in a Hewlett Packard system that uses the 
   885	Ack/Enq communications protocol.
   886	
   887	
   888	***************************
   889	BEFORE INSTALLING THE MODEM
   890	
   891	A typical new modem user has a PC with a printer connected to the PC's 
   892	parallel printer port, and a mouse cable attached to the PC's first 
   893	serial port.  For this user, the modem is the only device that requires 
   894	a second serial port.  If this is your situation, you can skip this 
   895	entire section except for DIP Switches, just before Installing the Modem.  
   896	Just remember that after you load your communications software, you'll 
   897	have to set the software to use the COM2 serial port.
   898	
   899	IBM PC-compatible serial ports are referred to as COM ports.  Two COM ports 
   900	are standard:  COM1 and COM2.  DOS recognizes up to four COM ports, although 
   901	more can be programmed.  The Courier is set at the factory to use COM2.  
   902	This is because many computers are shipped with COM1 equipped with an 
   903	external serial connector for attaching a device such as a serial printer 
   904	or serial mouse.  If you have one or more of these devices, you're probably 
   905	already familiar with COM ports on a PC.
   906	
   907	If you're only using COM1 for a device, you can skip this section except 
   908	for DIP Switches, just before Installing the Modem.  If you've already 
   909	installed devices at both COM1 and COM2, you will have to select either 
   910	COM3 or COM4.  Carefully review the following section for complete 
   911	instructions.
   912	
   913	********************
   914	Select a Serial Port
   915	WARNING:  If you are going to use COM1, COM3, or COM4, you must change some 
   916	switches on the modem board, called jumpers.  First, you need to select the 
   917	correct Interrupt Request (IRQ) to use at that serial port.  Peripheral 
   918	devices use IRQs to instruct the computer to stop the processor's current 
   919	operation; this allows the devices to perform their operations.
   920	
   921	Using COM1, 2, 3 or 4 depends on your equipment's configuration, as 
   922	described below.  Remember which serial port you assign to the modem, 
   923	because you must specify it to your
   924	communications software later.  
   925	The table in the next section includes hexadecimal addresses, required 
   926	by some software.
   927	
   928	COM1:        You may use this port if the computer does not have an installed 
   929		     serial connector at COM1.  (This situation is unlikely.)  You 
   930		     will have to modify some switches on the modem, so be sure to 
   931		     read this entire section of the chapter.  However, you may prefer 
   932		     to leave the modem set to COM2 and proceed to DIP Switches, just 
   933		     before the installation instructions.
   934	
   935	COM2:        If your computer is equipped with one serial connector at COM1, 
   936		     and if you are not already using COM2 for another device, use 
   937		     this port.  (This is the most common configuration.)  Since the 
   938		     modem is already set to operate at COM2, skip the rest of this
   939		     section and proceed to DIP Switches, just before the installation
   940		     instructions.
   941	
   942	COM3, COM4:  If you have two serial devices that already use COM1 and COM2, 
   943		     you can set the modem for either COM3 or COM4.  Review your 
   944		     communications software documentation to be sure your program 
   945		     supports these additional serial ports.  (Most programs do.)  
   946		     If your software doesn't, you will have to remove one of the 
   947		     other devices.
   948	
   949	*********************************
   950	Select an Interrupt Request (IRQ)
   951	IBM-compatible computers reserve IRQ4 for COM1 and IRQ3 for COM2, as shown 
   952	below.  Some communication programs support reserved IRQs for two serial 
   953	ports.
   954	
   955	     Serial Port    IRQ     Serial Port Address (Hex)
   956		COM1        IRQ4        3F8-3FF
   957		COM2        IRQ3        2F8-2FF
   958		COM3        IRQ4*       3E8-3EF
   959		COM4        IRQ3*       2E8-2EF
   960	  
   961	*Select IRQ4 (COM3) or IRQ3 (COM4) only after reading the following 
   962	 guidelines:
   963	
   964	If you need to use COM3 or COM4, keep the following in mind:
   965	
   966	*  The Courier supports three additional IRQs:  IRQ2, IRQ5 and IRQ7.  
   967	   Your software must support the one you use for COM3 or COM4.  However, 
   968	   if your computer is XT-compatible, IRQ5 is reserved for the hard disk, 
   969	   and it is not available for a serial port.  IRQ5 is available on 286-PCs 
   970	   and higher.
   971	
   972	*  Two devices should not use the same IRQ at the same time, because there 
   973	   will be a conflict and you will probably lose data.  For example, if you 
   974	   use IRQ4 for a mouse installed at COM1 and for your modem installed at 
   975	   COM3 (as shown in the previous table) you cannot use the mouse and the 
   976	   modem at the same time.
   977	   
   978	   Additionally, if an installed device doesn't use IRQs, you can use the 
   979	   IRQ normally associated with that COM port.  For example, if you have a 
   980	   serial printer at COM1 and you know it does not use an IRQ, you can use 
   981	   IRQ4 at COM3.  Similarly, you could use IRQ3 at COM4 if the device at 
   982	   COM2 doesn't use IRQ3.
   983	
   984	If you cannot find the information you need in your software documentation, 
   985	call your software's Technical Support Department for help in selecting an 
   986	IRQ.  You may find it necessary to re-install your serial devices to 
   987	correctly allocate the available serial ports and IRQs.
   988	
   989	*****************
   990	Reset the Jumpers
   991	If you hold the modem so that the rear panel is at the bottom and the edge 
   992	connector is at the left of the circuit board you can locate the COM and 
   993	IRQ jumpers near the center left side of the board.
   994	
   995	Each jumper has two upright contacts connected by a black plastic piece, 
   996	called a shunt, placed over the contacts for the COM2 and IRQ3 settings.  
   997	This shunt selects the jumper by closing the circuit.
   998	
   999	To change a jumper setting, gently lift off the black shunt and replace it 
  1000	over the contacts you want.
  1001	
  1002	As we've said, your choice of an IRQ for COM3 or COM4 depends on your 
  1003	hardware/software configuration.  If the device at COM1 or COM2 isn't 
  1004	using IRQ4 or IRQ3, you may use one of them.  Otherwise, check your PC 
  1005	and software documentation to see if you may use IRQ2, IRQ5 or IRQ7.
  1006	
  1007	WARNING:  Do not select an IRQ position until you've read the previous 
  1008	guidelines and reviewed your software documentation. 
  1009	
  1010	****************
  1011	Set DIP Switches
  1012	A ten-position bank of Dual In-Line Package (DIP) switches is located at 
  1013	the rear of the modem.  A summary of the DIP switch functions and options 
  1014	is in Appendix B in this manual and on the Quick Reference Card. 
  1015	
  1016	WARNING:  Check your software documentation for its requirements, 
  1017	particularly for DIP switches 1, 4, 5 and 6. 
  1018	
  1019	NOTE:  Once the modem is installed, the DIP switches are accessible 
  1020	through the computer's rear panel.
  1021	
  1022	********************
  1023	Installing the Modem
  1024	1. Turn off the computer and peripheral devices.
  1025	
  1026	2. Remove the computer's cover.  Refer to the computer manual, if 
  1027	   necessary, to see which rear panel screws to remove before sliding 
  1028	   the cover off.
  1029	
  1030	   NOTE:  Our illustration shows expansion slots lined up vertically on 
  1031	   the floor of the computer.  Some computers are configured so that the 
  1032	   expansion slots are stacked horizontally, one on top of another.  
  1033	   The following instructions apply for both configurations.
  1034	
  1035	3. Unscrew the solid bracket at the back of any available expansion slot.  
  1036	   (The modem board requires at least a standard half-card slot.)
  1037	
  1038	   The bracket will pop out of the back, leaving an opening in the rear 
  1039	   panel for access to the modem's phone jacks and DIP switches.
  1040	
  1041	4. Expansion slots have either a 3-inch-long groove, or a 3-inch and a 
  1042	   2-inch groove.  These grooves are lined on both sides with metal guides.  
  1043	   Insert the modem board into the slot you've chosen, as in Figure 3.3, 
  1044	   with the leads on the modem board's edge connector firmly in the 3-inch 
  1045	   groove.
  1046	
  1047	5. Screw the vertical bracket at the back of the modem firmly to the 
  1048	   computer's rear panel, as shown in Figure 3.3.  This helps block radio 
  1049	   frequency emissions from the computer and keeps the modem board firmly 
  1050	   in place.
  1051	
  1052	6. Replace the cover of the computer and replace the screws.
  1053	
  1054	7. If you currently have a phone plugged into the wall jack, disconnect it.  
  1055	   Plug one end of the phone cable that came with the modem into the TELCO 
  1056	   jack at the rear of the modem.  This allows the modem to switch into the 
  1057	   telephone network, get a dial tone, and so on.  Plug the other end of 
  1058	   the cable into the wall jack.
  1059	
  1060	   NOTE:  The phone cable is equipped with two standard, modular RJ11C 
  1061	   phone connectors.  If you have an older type of wall jack, you can 
  1062	   purchase an adapter and RJ11C connector from your phone company or 
  1063	   computer dealer.
  1064	
  1065	8. If you wish, plug your phone's cord into the second jack on the modem, 
  1066	   labeled PHONE.  This enables you to use your phone for conventional 
  1067	   voice calls, and also allows you to switch between voice and data 
  1068	   transmission in the same call.  See Voice/Data Communications in 
  1069	   Appendix G for more information.
  1070	
  1071	************************
  1072	Testing the Installation
  1073	Use the following procedures to verify that your modem is working properly.
  1074	
  1075	1. Turn on your computer.  Then turn the Courier's power switch ON.  The 
  1076	   following front panel indicators, or LEDs, will light up on the modem. 
  1077	   
  1078		CD      Carrier Detect, if you have set DIP switch 6 ON, enabling 
  1079			the CD override
  1080		TR      Data Terminal Ready, if you have set DIP switch 1 ON, 
  1081			enabling the DTR override
  1082		MR      Modem Ready/Power ON
  1083		CS      Clear to Send
  1084	
  1085	2. If you're using a personal computer, load your software to start the 
  1086	   program.  Set your terminal or software to 19.2K bps or 9600 bps.  
  1087	   In addition, set a word length of either 7 bits plus 1 parity bit, or 
  1088	   8 bits with no parity—it doesn't matter which at this time—and 1 Stop 
  1089	   bit.  Set the software to use the correct serial port (port through 
  1090	   which the modem connects to the computer).
  1091	
  1092	3. Perform the function that lets you send AT commands to the modem, that 
  1093	   is, puts the computer in Terminal mode.  Some communications programs 
  1094	   do this automatically upon loading.  Others require you to display a 
  1095	   communications or terminal screen, type a Function key, or perform some 
  1096	   other operation.
  1097	
  1098	   Review your communications software documentation for instructions. 
  1099	
  1100	4. Send the following attention command.  Type either upper or lower case 
  1101	   letters, not a combination, and then press the Enter (Carriage Return) 
  1102	   key, shown in the example below between angle brackets.  (Don't type 
  1103	   the angle brackets.)
  1104		
  1105		AT <Enter>
  1106	
  1107	   If everything is correct, the modem responds as follows:
  1108	
  1109		OK
  1110	
  1111	   Go on to step 5.
  1112	
  1113	   Troubleshooting
  1114	   If your entered command is not displayed, your local echo is OFF.  To turn 
  1115	   the local echo ON, send the modem the following command:  
  1116	    
  1117	      ATE1 <Enter>
  1118	
  1119	   If double characters appear on the screen, both your modem and software are 
  1120	   set to local echo ON.  Either set your software to local echo OFF, or turn 
  1121	   the modem's echo OFF with the following command:
  1122	    
  1123	      ATE0 <Enter>
  1124	
  1125	   If no OK appears on your screen after you completed Step 4, review the 
  1126	   following checkpoints:
  1127	
  1128	   a. Make sure you type all upper or lower case letters and press <Enter>.
  1129	   b. Check to see that you set your communications software to the correct 
  1130	      serial port.  The correct serial port is the port to which the modem is 
  1131	      connected to the computer.
  1132	   c. Make sure your software has put the computer in Terminal mode, so that 
  1133	      you can send the modem commands.  Then review Step 4, on the previous 
  1134	      page.
  1135	   d. Be sure that DIP switches 1 and 6 are set ON or OFF according to your 
  1136	      terminal or software requirements.  The table in Appendix B explains 
  1137	      each function, and you may also need to review your terminal or 
  1138	      communications software documentation.
  1139	   e. If you set DIP switch 8 OFF, for Dumb mode, reset the modem to Smart 
  1140	      mode:  set DIP switch 8 to ON.
  1141	   f. The modem is shipped with DIP switch 3 ON, enabling the result codes.  
  1142	      If DIP switch 3 is OFF, set it to the ON position.  Then initiate the 
  1143	      new switch setting with the following reset command:
  1144	      
  1145	      ATZ <Enter>
  1146	
  1147	5. As a final check, make sure the modem gets a dial tone.  Type the 
  1148	   following Dial command:
  1149	       
  1150	       ATD <Enter>
  1151	
  1152	   On receipt of the command, the modem goes off hook and waits for a dial 
  1153	   tone.  The OH indicator lights up, and you'll hear the dial tone from 
  1154	   the modem's speaker.  To cancel the operation, press any key.
  1155	
  1156	   Troubleshooting
  1157	   If you don't hear the dial tone, first increase the volume by using the 
  1158	   L command.  If that doesn't work, check to see that the phone cable from 
  1159	   the wall jack is connected to the correct jack on the modem.  If 
  1160	   necessary, reconnect the phone cable correctly.  Then try the Dial 
  1161	   command again, ATD <Enter>.
  1162	
  1163	Chapter Four--Data Mode Operations
  1164	
  1165	The information in this chapter applies to asynchronous calls only.  For 
  1166	synchronous operations, refer to Appendix F.
  1167	
  1168	Detailed command descriptions are in this chapter.  Additional command 
  1169	summaries are in Appendix C, on the bottom panel of the modem, and in 
  1170	the Quick-Reference Card.
  1171	
  1172	*****************
  1173	COMMAND SET USAGE
  1174	
  1175	The Courier command set enables you to send the modem two kinds of 
  1176	instructions:
  1177	
  1178	* operations, such as dialing or hanging up
  1179	* configurations, such as enabling error control or data compression
  1180	
  1181	Follow these guidelines:
  1182	
  1183	1. Your software must be loaded and, if you are using a computer, it must 
  1184	   be in Terminal mode.  
  1185	   
  1186	   Some communications programs put the computer in terminal mode 
  1187	   automatically when they are loaded.  Others require you to display a 
  1188	   communications terminal screen, press a Function key, or perform some 
  1189	   other operation.  Refer to your communications software documentation 
  1190	   for instructions.
  1191	
  1192	   In Terminal mode the computer acts as if it were a standard terminal 
  1193	   such as a teletypewriter, rather than a data processor.  Keyboard 
  1194	   entries go directly to the modem, whether the entry is a modem command 
  1195	   or data to be transmitted over the phone lines.  Received data is 
  1196	   output directly to the screen. 
  1197	
  1198	2. Type commands in either upper or lower case, not a combination (AT 
  1199	   or at--not At).
  1200	
  1201	3. All commands except A/, A> and +++ are preceded by the AT (attention)
  1202	   prefix and are executed with the Enter/Carriage Return key (<Enter>).
  1203	
  1204	4. Command length = 60 characters maximum.  The modem doesn't count the 
  1205	   AT prefix, Carriage Return character, or spaces.  It counts (but 
  1206	   doesn't act on) punctuation such as hyphens and parentheses.
  1207	
  1208	5. A missing numeric parameter is assumed to be zero, as in the command 
  1209	   to hang up:  ATH <Enter> is the equivalent of ATH0 <Enter>.
  1210	
  1211	   Example (spaces are not required, but are added here for readability):
  1212	  
  1213		  AT &K3 X2 DT 071 312 1234 <Enter>
  1214	
  1215	     AT      Attention; a command follows.
  1216	     &K3     Disable MNP5 data compression; use only V.42 bis compression.
  1217	     X2      Use the X2 result code subset.
  1218	     DT      Dial the following number using tone dialing.
  1219	     <Enter> Execute the commands.
  1220

  1268	Dialing
  1269	Dn      Dial the specified phone number; also execute Dial options.
  1270		The maximum number of characters allowed is 60, including the AT 
  1271		prefix, punctuation and spaces.  The Carriage Return (Enter key) 
  1272		isn't counted as a character.
  1273	
  1274		NOTE:  With the exception of the following Dial options, the 
  1275		modem ignores any commands issued after D in the same command 
  1276		string.  
  1277		
  1278	Dial Options
  1279	D       Dial the number that follows and enter Originate mode.  Optional 
  1280		parameters:
  1281	
  1282		P  Pulse dial.  Default.
  1283	
  1284		T  Tone dial.
  1285	
  1286		,  (Comma) Pause for 2 seconds before continuing to dial.
  1287	
  1288		;  Return to Command mode after dialing.  If your phone is 
  1289		   plugged into the modem, you can use this option to have the modem 
  1290		   Auto Dial a telephone rather than a modem.  The Courier dials, 
  1291		   remains off hook and returns the OK message, indicating it is in 
  1292		   Command mode.
  1293	
  1294		   For example, to have the modem place a voice call, enter the Dial 
  1295		   command with a semicolon:  
  1296	
  1297			ATDT5551234; <Enter>
  1298	
  1299		   When the modem returns the OK result, pick up your phone receiver 
  1300		   so you can talk to the other party, and send the command that 
  1301		   hangs up the modem: 
  1302	
  1303			ATH <Enter>
  1304	
  1305		"  Dial the letters that follow (in an alphabetical phone number).  
  1306	
  1307		   NOTE:  If you are including another command after the dial string, 
  1308		   use closing quotation marks before the additional command. 
  1309	
  1310	       !   Transfer a call (flash the switch-hook).  This command applies to 
  1311		   modems in installations where other modems share the phone line.  
  1312		   The modem flashes the switch-hook (goes off hook 0.5 seconds, on 
  1313		   hook for 0.5 seconds and off hook again) to dial the specified 
  1314		   extension.
  1315	
  1316	       W   This command is useful in situations where you must wait for a 
  1317		   second dial tone before continuing dialing.  For example, if 
  1318		   you need to dial for an outside line, the Courier continues 
  1319		   dialing as soon as it detects the next dial tone.
  1320	
  1321			 AT DT 9 W 5551234 <Enter>
  1322	
  1323		   NOTE:  This command executes only if result code option X3 
  1324		   or greater has been issued.  If the modem is set to X2 or lower, 
  1325		   the modem interprets the W as a comma (two-second pause).
  1326	
  1327	       @   Wait for an answer (with X3 or higher).  Some online services 
  1328		   answer the phone and return a tape-recorded request for 
  1329		   information before processing transactions.  In such instances, 
  1330		   the @ command can be used in the Dial string to tell the modem 
  1331		   to detect at least one ring, wait for five seconds of silence 
  1332		   at the other end of the call, and then continue to execute the 
  1333		   Dial string.
  1334		   
  1335		   To use the @ command, set the modem to X3, X4 or X7.  If the 
  1336		   modem is set to X2 or lower, the modem returns an ERROR message 
  1337		   when encountering the @ character in a command string.  If set 
  1338		   to X5 or X6, the modem hangs up when it detects a voice answer 
  1339		   and sends the VOICE result code.  
  1340	
  1341	       /   A slash (/) causes a pause of only 125 milliseconds.
  1342	
  1343	       R   Reverse frequencies.  This command allows calls to an 
  1344		   originate-only modem.  It reverses the modem's originate/answer 
  1345		   frequencies, forcing the Courier to dial out at the answer 
  1346		   frequency.  The command follows the Dial command, before or 
  1347		   after the phone number:
  1348	
  1349			 AT D1234567R <Enter> 
  1350	
  1351	X2-X7   Adaptive dialing.  When any of the X2 through X7 options is in 
  1352		effect and you do not issue a dialing type in the Dial string, 
  1353		the Courier uses tone dialing, which is faster than the default 
  1354		pulse type.  However, if the phone company's central office does 
  1355		not have tone detection equipment, the modem cannot break dial 
  1356		and continues to detect the dial tone.  If this occurs, the 
  1357		modem automatically reverts to pulse dialing. 
  1358	
  1359	DL      Dial the last-dialed number.  The modem stores each Dial command 
  1360		until it receives the next Dial command.  Use DL instead of A/, 
  1361		described on the next page, if you wish to send the modem non-Dial 
  1362		commands before dialing again.
  1363	
  1364	DSn     Dial the number stored in nonvolatile random access memory at 
  1365		position n, where n = 0 through 9. 
  1366	   
  1367	Cancel Dialing
  1368	To cancel Dial-command execution, press any key. If you 
  1369	inadvertently hit a key on the keyboard while the modem is dialing, 
  1370	the call is canceled.  If this occurs, type the A/ command explained 
  1371	under Automated Redialing below. 
  1372	
  1373	When the modem receives a command, it stores the instruction in 
  1374	its command buffer until it receives the next AT command.  Note 
  1375	that if you've sent the modem an additional command since the Dial 
  1376	command, A/ re-executes that command instead of redialing. 
  1377	
  1378	Store Phone Numbers
  1379	&Zn=s   This command stores up to ten numbers, where n is the position 
  1380		0 through 9 in nonvolatile memory, and s is the phone number string.  
  1381		The number-string may be up to 40 characters long, including any 
  1382		Dial command options.  
  1383	
  1384		      AT &Z2=555-6789 <Enter>
  1385	
  1386		Do not include modem settings in the &Zn string.  If the call 
  1387		requires a special setting, insert it in the command string before 
  1388		the DSn command.  In the following example, &M0 (no error control) 
  1389		is inserted before the Dial command:
  1390	
  1391		      AT&M0 DS2 <Enter>
  1392	
  1393		NOTE:  The &Zn=s command functions differently when Dial Security 
  1394		is enabled.  See Appendix D for more information.
  1395	
  1396	&Zn?    Display the phone number stored in NVRAM at position n 
  1397		(n = 0 through 9).
  1398	
  1399	Redialing
  1400	A/      Re-execute the last issued command.  A/ doesn't take the AT prefix 
  1401		or a Carriage Return, and can be used to redial.
  1402	
  1403			A/
  1404	
  1405	   Automated Redialing (>, A>)
  1406	   While > and A> can be used to continuously repeat any command, 
  1407	   they are designed for automated redialing.
  1408	
  1409	      Enter Repeat Mode
  1410	>       If you know the modem you are calling is frequently busy,
  1411		include the Repeat command in the Dial string, as follows:
  1412	       
  1413		       AT > DT 1234567 <Enter>  or
  1414		       AT DT 1234567 > <Enter>
  1415	
  1416		The modem enters Repeat mode, dials the number, waits 60 seconds 
  1417		for a carrier (default), and hangs up.  Then after a two-second 
  1418		pause, it redials.  
  1419	
  1420		The cycle continues until the modems connect or the modem reaches a 
  1421		maximum of 10 attempts.  The 10-try limit is mandated by Industry 
  1422		Canada (IC) to prevent tying up local telephone company exchanges 
  1423		with unconnected calls.
  1424	
  1425	A>      This command combines the features of both the A/ and > commands.  
  1426		The modem enters Repeat mode as described above, and redials the 
  1427		Dial string in the command buffer.  Like the A/ command, A> does 
  1428		not take the AT prefix or a Carriage Return.
  1429	
  1430	     Exit Repeat Mode 
  1431		Should you use > or A> with a command other than a Dial string, 
  1432		abort the cycle by pressing any key.
  1433	
  1434		To abort automated redialing, be sure to press any key when the 
  1435		result code appears, during the pause before the modem begins 
  1436		dialing again.  If you press any key while the modem is dialing, 
  1437		that dial attempt is canceled but the cycle continues.
  1438	
  1439	Answer Mode
  1440	     Force Answer Mode
  1441	A       Force Answer mode when the modem hasn't received an incoming call.
  1442	
  1443	     Auto Answer
  1444		The Courier is shipped with DIP switch 5 ON, Auto Answer suppressed.  
  1445		To set the modem to automatically answer incoming calls, do one of 
  1446		the following: 
  1447	
  1448		1. Before powering on the modem, set DIP switch 5 OFF.  When you 
  1449		   turn the computer on, the modem answers incoming calls on the 
  1450		   first ring.
  1451	
  1452		2. When the modem is on, set your communications software to enable 
  1453		   auto answer.  The following command instructs the modem to answer 
  1454		   on the first ring.  (You can substitute a higher value.  See the 
  1455		   S-Register summary in Appendix B.) 
  1456	
  1457			 AT S0 = 1 <Enter>
  1458	
  1459		When the modem senses a call coming in, it sends the result code 
  1460		RING to your screen, goes off hook, and sends the remote modem a 
  1461		high-pitched answer tone.  If there is no Carrier Detect within 
  1462		60 seconds, the modem hangs up.  If the connection is made, the 
  1463		modem sends a CONNECT result code.  When the call is disconnected 
  1464		by you or the remote user, the modem hangs up and returns the NO 
  1465		CARRIER code.
  1466	
  1467		NOTE:  If DIP switch 5 is OFF and S0=0, the Auto Answer will be 
  1468		disabled.  Be sure that S0=1 through 256.
  1469	
  1470	      Suppressing Auto Answer
  1471		To disable Auto Answer, reverse Steps 1 or 2 above.  Set DIP switch 
  1472		5 ON before powering on the modem, or set the modem to answer on 
  1473		zero rings with the following command.
  1474	
  1475		      AT S0 = 0 <Enter>
  1476	
  1477	   Points to Remember
  1478		1. If the modem is attached to a computer, you can set the modem to 
  1479		   receive calls when you're not at your computer.  Load your 
  1480		   communications software as you normally do, and set the modem 
  1481		   to Auto Answer.  Also set your software's host mode function 
  1482		   to save incoming messages and/or files.
  1483	
  1484		2. If you've attached your phone so it can be used for conventional 
  1485		   calls, disable Auto Answer when you are not expecting incoming 
  1486		   data calls.  Otherwise, your modem may answer the phone before 
  1487		   you do, greeting a voice caller with a high-pitched answer tone.
  1488	
  1489	Hanging Up
  1490	Hn      On/off hook control.
  1491		H0   Hang up (go on hook).
  1492		H1   Go off hook.
  1493	
  1494	+++     Escape code operations.  Once the modem is online to another system, 
  1495		the only command it recognizes is an escape code of three typed 
  1496		pluses, which forces the modem back to Command mode.  
  1497	
  1498		Do the following when issuing the command:  
  1499		* Wait one second after sending the last item of data
  1500		* Type: +++
  1501		* Wait one second before typing any data
  1502	
  1503		Do not type the AT prefix or a Carriage Return.  The guard time of 
  1504		one second before and after the code prevents the modem from 
  1505		misinterpreting the occurrence of +++ in the transmitted data stream.  
  1506	
  1507		If necessary, the character used in the escape code or the duration 
  1508		of the guard time can be changed by resetting Register S2 or S12.  
  1509		See the S-Register Summary in Appendix B.
  1510	
  1511		In response to +++, the modem returns to Command mode.  However, 
  1512		it keeps the line open or hangs up, depending on the setting of 
  1513		DIP switch 9: 
  1514	
  1515		DIP Switch 9    Response to +++
  1516		    OFF         Modem goes on hook (hangs up), sends NO CARRIER
  1517				result code (factory setting)
  1518		    ON          Modem maintains connection (Online-Command mode), 
  1519				sends OK result code 
  1520	
  1521		The factory setting (OFF) forces an automatic disconnect when you 
  1522		issue +++.   One advantage of this is that you are not likely to 
  1523		inadvertently run up an all-night phone bill.  
  1524	
  1525		Set DIP switch 9 ON if you want the modem to respond to +++ by 
  1526		entering Online-Command mode, enabling it to execute commands and 
  1527		return online.  (See the O command, next.)  
  1528	
  1529		WARNING:  For unattended modem operations:  in rare instances, the 
  1530		modem may fail to recognize the +++ escape code sequence.  If you 
  1531		are running the modem under software control for unattended 
  1532		operations, we suggest you use the sure fire method of dropping the 
  1533		DTR signal from the computer or terminal for at least 50 
  1534		milliseconds, to avoid costly phone charges.  Methods of turning 
  1535		the DTR signal off--for example, closing the communications port--
  1536		differ from one computer to another. 
  1537	
  1538	   Returning Online 
  1539	On      If DIP switch 9 is ON (on detection of the escape code the modem 
  1540		maintains the connection), you can issue commands and then toggle 
  1541		the modem back online with the On command, as in this example:
  1542	
  1543			AT Q1 O <Enter>
  1544	
  1545		There are two ways to return online.
  1546		ATO0    Return online (normal).  (Used in the example above.)
  1547		ATO1    Return online and retrain.  Use to have the modem 
  1548			re-synchronize if there were errors in a non-ARQ data 
  1549			transfer.
  1550	
  1551	   Hanging Up
  1552		If DIP switch 9 is ON, the escape code forces the modem back to 
  1553		Command mode but leaves the line open.  If you want the modem to 
  1554		hang up, issue the following command once the modem sends the 
  1555		OK result code:
  1556	
  1557			 ATH <Enter>
  1558	
  1559		If DIP switch 9 is OFF, the modem automatically hangs up on receipt 
  1560		of the escape code.
  1561	
  1562	**********************
  1563	SETTING/USING DEFAULTS
  1564	
  1565	The modem's read-only memory (ROM) permanently stores the modem's four 
  1566	factory template settings.  Nonvolatile random access memory (NVRAM) 
  1567	allows you to save one of these four templates, or add your own 
  1568	modifications, and write all the settings to NVRAM as your power-on 
  1569	defaults.
  1570	
  1571	&Fn     The modem is shipped with four configurations (templates), 
  1572		&F0 through &F3, stored in permanent nonprogrammable memory (ROM).  
  1573		Appendix B includes configuration listings for each template.  
  1574		Any one of the templates may be loaded into current memory (AT &Fn) 
  1575		or written to nonvolatile memory to serve as the reset default 
  1576		(AT &Fn &W).  Note, however, that &F0 is always loaded into memory 
  1577		if DIP switch 10 is ON. 
  1578	
  1579		When you power on the Courier, it loads the settings stored in 
  1580		NVRAM if DIP switch 10 is OFF.  Until you write your own settings 
  1581		to NVRAM, the defaults stored there are the same as the permanent 
  1582		ROM factory settings stored in position 1, &F1.
  1583	
  1584	
  1585		To view the &F1 settings, select option 5 of the I (inquiry) command:
  1586	   
  1587			   AT I5 <Enter>
  1588	
  1589	Customizing NVRAM
  1590	&W      To substitute a template other than &F1, write the desired template 
  1591		to NVRAM, using the &W command.
  1592	  
  1593			  AT &F2 &W <Enter>
  1594	
  1595		To modify the &Fn configuration in NVRAM, type your changes and 
  1596		then save them to NVRAM, as in the following example.  The original 
  1597		factory template remains intact.
  1598	
  1599			  AT M2 S10=40 &A2 &W <Enter>\
  1600	
  1601		NOTE:  When writing a different default configuration to NVRAM, 
  1602		insert any additions after the &Fn command but before &W.  Otherwise 
  1603		they will be overwritten by &Fn.
  1604	
  1605		After sending a configuration to NVRAM, you can change any setting 
  1606		just for the current session, as in the following example.  The 
  1607		NVRAM configuration remains intact. 
  1608	
  1609			  ATX6 <Enter>  
  1610	
  1611		But if you want the new setting to be a default, write it to 
  1612		NVRAM at the same time, as in the following example.  X7 is 
  1613		substituted for the Xn value stored earlier.  Any other setting 
  1614		that was changed and can be saved to NVRAM will also be saved. 
  1615		
  1616			  AT X7 &W <Enter>
  1617	
  1618	Resetting the Modem
  1619	Z       Software reset to NVRAM settings when DIP switch 10 is OFF (factory 
  1620		setting).  If DIP switch 10 is OFF, the modem resets to the &F0 
  1621		configuration template, with no flow control.
  1622	
  1623		NOTE:  Use the ATZ command also if you've changed the position of 
  1624		DIP switches 1 through 7 or 9 while the modem is on, so that the 
  1625		modem can read the new setting.  The only other way to initiate 
  1626		a new setting for switches 1 through 7 and 9 is to turn the modem 
  1627		off and on again. 
  1628	
  1629	
  1630	*************
  1631	CONFIGURATION
  1632	
  1633	Echo/Speaker
  1634	En      Command mode local echo.  Enables/disables the display of your 
  1635		typed commands.  If double characters appear on the screen, both 
  1636		the modem's local echo and your software's local echo are on.  
  1637	
  1638		The Courier is shipped with DIP switch 4 OFF, enabling local echo.  
  1639		The En command controls the local echo for a current session, 
  1640		independently of the switch setting.  At power-on and reset, the 
  1641		modem operates according to the DIP switch setting.  The En command 
  1642		is not stored in nonvolatile memory as a power-on/reset default.
  1643	
  1644		E0      Command mode echo OFF.  The modem does not display keyboard 
  1645			commands.
  1646		E1      Command mode echo ON.
  1647	
  1648	Fn      Online local echo.  This command causes the modem to display a copy 
  1649		of the data it is transmitting to another system.  Many systems, 
  1650		however, return a copy of received data, which is called a remote 
  1651		echo.  If the modem's online echo is ON and there is also remote 
  1652		echoing, double characters appear on the screen.  
  1653	
  1654		In some microcomputer documentation, the term duplex is applied to 
  1655		local online echoing, although the term is not technically accurate.
  1656	
  1657		F0      Online echo ON.  Sometimes called half duplex.  As the 
  1658			modem transmits data to a remote system, it also sends a 
  1659			copy of the data to the screen.
  1660		F1      Online echo OFF.  Sometimes called full duplex.  Default.
  1661	
  1662	Mn      Speaker (audio monitor).
  1663		M0      The speaker is always OFF.
  1664		M1      The speaker is ON until carrier is established.  Default.
  1665		M2      The speaker is always ON, including during data transfer.
  1666		M3      The speaker is ON after the last digit is dialed and remains 
  1667		ON until carrier is established.
  1668	
  1669	Result Codes
  1670	Qn      Enable/suppress the display of result codes.  The Courier is 
  1671		shipped with DIP switch 3 ON, to display result codes.  Use the 
  1672		Qn command to control the display for a current session, 
  1673		independently of the switch setting. 
  1674	
  1675		At power-on and reset, the modem operates according to the DIP 
  1676		switch setting.  The Qn command is not stored in nonvolatile 
  1677		random access memory.
  1678	
  1679		Q0      Result codes displayed.
  1680		Q1      Result codes suppressed (quiet).
  1681		Q2      Result codes suppressed in Answer mode.
  1682	
  1683	Vn      Return result codes in words or numbers (Verbal/Numeric mode). 
  1684		At power-on and reset, the modem operates according to the DIP 
  1685		switch setting.  The Vn command is not stored in nonvolatile 
  1686		memory as a power-on/reset default.
  1687		V0      Numeric mode.

  1833		&A3     Additional error control indicator (LAPM, HST, MNP, SYNC, or 
  1834			ONE) and data compression type (V42BIS or MNP5).  Default.  
  1835			When the call is not under one of those protocols (and ARQ 
  1836			is not included in the result code), the modem reports 
  1837			either SYNC, indicating a synchronous connection, or 
  1838			NONE, for no protocol.  
  1839	
  1840			If the modems are using data compression, the type of 
  1841			compression, V42BIS or MNP5, is added to the result code.  
  1842			In the first of the following examples, the modems 
  1843			negotiated error control for the call (ARQ), used VFC 
  1844			modulation, are using the LAPM error control protocol, and 
  1845			are using V.42 bis compression.

  1862	Modulation
  1863	Bn      Handshake options.  There are three commands that apply to 
  1864		international calls above 1200 bps--Bn, &Gn, &Pn.  See International 
  1865		Calls later in this chapter for information on the other two 
  1866		settings.
  1867		B0      ITU-T (formerly CCITT) answer sequence.  Default.  This 
  1868			is required to answer all V.32-type calls, as well as 
  1869			calls from overseas.
  1870		B1      Bell answer tone.  This setting selects HST modulation 
  1871			in Dual Standard modems, but should only be used if the 
  1872			modem is not required to answer V.32-type calls.  
  1873	
  1874			NOTE:  This setting is required for HST cellular calls.
  1875	
  1876	Error Control/Data Compression
  1877	&Mn     Enable ARQ (error control) or synchronous protocols.  Both your 
  1878		modem and the remote modem must use the same protocol.
  1879		&M0     Normal mode, no error control.  Due to the nature of phone 
  1880			line channels, this is never recommended for calls above 
  1881			2400 bps.  
  1882		&M1     This setting is exclusive of the modems' error control and 
  1883			is used only for online synchronous mode without V.25 bis.  
  1884			See Appendix F for more information.
  1885		&M2     Reserved.
  1886		&M3     Reserved.
  1887		&M4     Normal/ARQ mode.  Default.  If an ARQ connection isn't made, 
  1888			the modem operates in Normal mode, as though it were set to 
  1889			&M0.
  1890	
  1891			NOTE:  When V.32-type modems revert to Normal mode, they 
  1892			transfer data at high speeds without the reliability 
  1893			of error control.  To avoid this, both local and remote 
  1894			modems should always be set for error control.  Modems in 
  1895			HST mode, if unable to establish an error control connection, 
  1896			drop to 2400 bps.
  1897	
  1898		&M5     The modem enters ARQ asynchronous mode.  The modem hangs up 
  1899			if an ARQ connection cannot be made.  
  1900		&M6     The modem enters V.25 bis synchronous mode, using a 
  1901			character-oriented link protocol similar to BISYNC.  See 
  1902			Appendix F for more information.
  1903		&M7     The modem enters V.25 bis synchronous mode, using the HDLC 
  1904			link protocol.
  1905	
  1906	&Kn     Enable/disable data compression.
  1907		&K0     Data compression disabled.
  1908		&K1     Auto enable/disable.  Default.  The modem enables 
  1909			compression if the serial port rate is fixed, &B1.  It 
  1910			disables compression if the serial port rate follows the 
  1911			connection rate, &B0, because compression offers no 
  1912			throughput advantage when the serial port and connection 
  1913			rates are equal.  Compression may even degrade throughput. 
  1914		&K2     Data compression enabled.  Use this setting to keep the 
  1915			modem from disabling compression. 
  1916		&K3     Selective data compression.  The modem negotiates only for 
  1917			V.42 bis compression, and disables MNP Level 5 (MNP5) 
  1918			compression.  Use this setting to transfer 8-bit binary 
  1919			files, .ZIP files, and other files that are already 
  1920			compressed.  See the note below.  
  1921	
  1922		NOTE:  MNP5 compression is not useful when transferring 
  1923		files that are already compressed, such as the .ZIP files 
  1924		downloaded from many Bulletin Boards and 8-bit binary files, 
  1925		which appear to the modem to be compressed.  MNP5 tends to 
  1926		add data to the transmission so that throughput over the 
  1927		link degrades.  V.42 bis compression dynamically detects 
  1928		when data is already compressed and turns off until it 
  1929		detects that compression will work to advantage.  The 
  1930		special &K3 setting enables the best throughput for already-
  1931		compressed files.  
  1932	
  1933		See Throughput Guidelines and Data Compression in Appendix A for 
  1934		more information, including throughput to expect for different 
  1935		kinds of files.
  1936	
  1937	Data Rates
  1938	The modem can be set to a fixed or variable serial port rate.  A fixed rate 
  1939	sets the modem for the highest possible throughput and provides the best 
  1940	performance.  A variable rate allows the modem to switch to match the more 
  1941	limited rate on the phone connection.
  1942	
  1943	Your software must support fixed or variable serial port rates, and must be 
  1944	set to either of the two settings.  NOTE:  Your software may refer to these 
  1945	options with terms like locked serial port (fixed rate) or autobaud (variable 
  1946	rate).
  1947	
  1948	&Bn     Serial port rate variable or fixed.
  1949		&B0     Variable rates.  When the modem switches its connection rate 
  1950			to connect with a modem operating at a different rate, it 
  1951			also switches its serial port rate.  The software or 
  1952			terminal also switches serial port rates to match the 
  1953			connection rate.  
  1954	
  1955		&B1     Fixed rate.  Default.  The modem always communicates with 
  1956			the terminal or computer at the rate at which you have set 
  1957			the terminal or software, regardless of the connection rate.  
  1958			For the greatest throughput, set the serial port to 115.2K, 
  1959			57.6K, 38.4K bps for high speed calls and to at least 9600 
  1960			bps for 2400-bps calls.
  1961	
  1962			This setting is not affected by the &N setting.  However, 
  1963			the serial port rate must be equal to or higher than the &Nn 
  1964			rate.
  1965	
  1966		&B2     Fixed for ARQ calls/Variable for non-ARQ calls.  Answer mode 
  1967			only.  When the modem goes off hook and connects in ARQ 
  1968			mode, it shifts its serial port rate up to a user-specified 
  1969			rate, for example, 38.4K bps.  If the connection is not 
  1970			under error control, the modem behaves as if it were set 
  1971			to &B0 and switches its serial port rate to match the 
  1972			connection rate of each call.
  1973	
  1974			To implement this feature, first set your software to the 
  1975			desired rate.  Then send the modem the AT &B2 [other 
  1976			settings] &W command.  
  1977	
  1978			The modem stores the rate of the command in NVRAM along 
  1979			with the settings.  Each time it makes an ARQ connection, 
  1980			the modem checks NVRAM for the specified serial port rate. 
  1981	
  1982			When sending subsequent configurations to NVRAM, be sure 
  1983			your software is set to your selected serial port rate, 
  1984			so that the correct rate is maintained.
  1985	
  1986	&Nn     Connection rate variable or fixed.
  1987		&N0     Variable rates.  Default.  The Courier negotiates with 
  1988			the remote modem for the highest possible connection rate, 
  1989			depending on the capabilities of the remote modem. 
  1990	
  1991		&N1-    Fixed rate.  The modem only connects if the remote
  1992		&N14    modem is operating at the same rate.  If not, the modem 
  1993			hangs up.  If you wish, you can filter out calls at other 
  1994			than a specific rate, for security or other reasons, by 
  1995			fixing the connection rate.
  1996	
  1997			The connection rate must always be lower than, or equal to, 
  1998			the serial port rate, never higher.  
  1999	       
  2000			The options are as follows.
  2001			&N1       300 bps       &N8     14.4K bps
  2002			&N2      1200 bps       &N9     16.8K bps 
  2003			&N3      2400 bps       &N10    19.2K bps
  2004			&N4      4800 bps       &N11    21.6K bps
  2005			&N5      7200 bps       &N12      24K bps 
  2006			&N6      9600 bps       &N13    26.4K bps
  2007			&N7       12K bps       &N14    28.8K bps

  2009	************************
  2010	RS-232 Signal Operations
  2011	&Cn     Carrier Detect operations.  At power-on and reset, the modem 
  2012	operates according to the setting of DIP switch 6.  This command 
  2013	is not stored in nonvolatile memory as a power-on/reset default.
  2014	&C0     CD override, CD always ON.
  2015	&C1     Normal CD operations.  The Courier sends a CD signal when 
  2016	it connects with another modem and drops the CD when it 
  2017	disconnects.
  2018	
  2019	&Dn     Data Terminal Ready (DTR) operations.  At power-on and reset, 
  2020		the modem operates according to the setting of DIP switch 1.  
  2021		This command is not stored in nonvolatile memory as a 
  2022		power-on/reset default.
  2023		&D0     DTR override.  The modem operates as though the DTR is 
  2024			always ON.
  2025	
  2026		&D1     Advance usage:  If issued before connecting with another 
  2027			modem, the modem can enter online command mode during a 
  2028			call by toggling DTR.  (Most communications software 
  2029			packages have a method for toggling DTR.)  &D1 functions 
  2030			similarly to the escape code (+++), except that this setting 
  2031			is independent of DIP switch 9.
  2032	
  2033			If DIP Switch 1 is ON (DTR override) when you issue the 
  2034			&D1 command, the DTR override is automatically turned off.  
  2035			However, if you change the setting of DIP switch 1 after 
  2036			issuing &D1, the DIP switch setting takes precedence.
  2037	
  2038			Return online with the On command, or hang up with the Hn 
  2039			command.
  2040	
  2041		&D2     Normal DTR operations.  The terminal or computer must send 
  2042			a DTR signal for the modem to accept commands.  Dropping 
  2043			DTR terminates a call.
  2044	
  2045	&Sn     The modem sends the computer or terminal a Data Set Ready (DSR) 
  2046		signal via the RS-232 interface.  (Data Set is industry jargon for 
  2047		modem.)  Few, if any, commercial communications programs require 
  2048		the modem to control DSR, &S1.  Leave the modem set for DSR 
  2049		overridden, &S0, unless you know that your installation requires 
  2050		a different setting.
  2051		&S0     DSR is always ON (override).  Default.
  2052		&S1     In Originate mode, the modem sends the DSR after it 
  2053			dials, when it detects the remote modem's answer tone.  
  2054			In Answer mode, the modem sends the DSR after it sends an 
  2055			answer tone.
  2056		&S2     This option is for specialized equipment such as automatic 
  2057			callback units.  On loss of carrier, the modem sends a 
  2058			pulsed DSR signal with Clear to Send (CTS) following 
  2059	
  2060	Carrier Detect (CD).
  2061		&S3     This is the same as &S2, but without the CTS following CD.
  2062		&S4     The modem sends the computer a DSR signal at the same time 
  2063			that it sends the Carrier Detect (CD) signal.
  2064		&S5     CTS follows Carrier Detect with SSR normal
  2065	
  2066	************
  2067	Flow Control
  2068	Flow control allows the modem to monitor the amount of data coming from the 
  2069	computer or the remote modem, and notify either end if its buffers are too 
  2070	full, so that they stop sending data for a moment.
  2071	
  2072	The modem uses either hardware or software flow control.  Your software and 
  2073	machine must support whichever type you select.  
  2074	
  2075	Hardware Control
  2076	The modem drops the Clear to Send (CTS) signal it's been sending to the 
  2077	computer or terminal when the modem's buffer nears 90% capacity.  It starts 
  2078	sending CTS again when the buffer is about half full.
  2079	
  2080	Software Control
  2081	The modem sends the computer or terminal the standard ASCII Transmit OFF 
  2082	(XOFF) character, <Ctrl>-S, when its buffer nears 90% capacity.  The modem 
  2083	sends the ASCII Transmit ON character, <Ctrl>-Q, when the buffer is about 
  2084	half full.  ASCII definitions are as follows:
  2085	
  2086	XON      <Ctrl>-Q       (ASCII 17 Decimal, 11 Hex)
  2087	XOFF     <Ctrl>-S       (ASCII 19 Decimal, 13 Hex)
  2088	
  2089	NOTE:  You should set your software as well to either hardware or software 
  2090	flow control.  Some programs also require that you turn off the type you are 
  2091	not using.
  2092	
  2093	The ASCII characters may be user-defined.  See Registers S22 and S23 in 
  2094	Appendix B.  That appendix also includes an ASCII chart. 
  2095	
  2096	WARNING:  If possible, always use hardware flow control, the factory 
  2097	default.  You may lose data if XON/XOFF (<Ctrl>-S, <Ctrl>-Q) characters 
  2098	occur in the data stream from other sources.  They may, for example, come 
  2099	from the remote system:  an XON from the remote system, after your modem 
  2100	has sent an XOFF, can result in buffer overflow.  
  2101	
  2102	<Ctrl>-S (XOFF) and <Ctrl>-Q (XON) characters also occur in binary files, 
  2103	and are used by Xmodem-type protocols.  You risk having these characters 
  2104	misinterpreted as modem flow control characters and dropped from the data 
  2105	stream.
  2106	
  2107	If you cannot use hardware flow control and if you're transferring non-text 
  2108	(binary) files, or using an Xmodem-type protocol, disable flow control 
  2109	entirely (&H0).  In addition, be sure the modem is set to &B0 and &N0, so 
  2110	that the serial port and connection rates are equal.
  2111	
  2112	   Transmit Data Buffer Sizes
  2113	      The Transmit Data refers to the data from the computer, which the 
  2114	      modem is to transmit over the phone line.
  2115	
  2116	      The size of the Transmit data buffer depends on whether the connection 
  2117	      is under error control or not, as follows.
  2118	
  2119	      * ARQ connections:  3.25K bytes.
  2120	      * Non-ARQ connections:  1.5K bytes, allowing use of error control file 
  2121		transfer protocols such as Xmodem and Ymodem without flow control.
  2122	
  2123	      If bit 3 of Register S15 is turned on, the non-ARQ buffer size is 
  2124	      reduced to 128 bytes, for the convenience of BBS operators taking 
  2125	      calls from remote users of slower modems.  See S-Register Summary, 
  2126	      S15, in Appendix B.
  2127	
  2128	   Received Data Buffer Size
  2129	     Received Data refers to the data the modem receives over the phone 
  2130	     link, which the modem passes on to the attached computer.
  2131	
  2132	     The size of this buffer remains constant at 2K bytes.
  2133	
  2134	Transmit Data Flow Control 
  2135	&Hn     This type of flow control is for data transmitted to the modem by 
  2136	its attached computer or terminal.  The modem monitors its buffer 
  2137	as data comes from the computer or modem.  If the buffer approaches 
  2138	90% capacity, the modem signals the computer or terminal to stop 
  2139	transmitting.  When the modem has sent enough data over the link 
  2140	to half empty the buffer, it signals the computer or terminal to 
  2141	resume transmitting.
  2142	
  2143		&H0     Transmit Data flow control disabled.
  2144		&H1     Hardware flow control.  Default.  Requires that your 
  2145			computer or terminal and software support Clear to Send 
  2146			(CTS) at the RS-232 interface.
  2147		&H2     Software flow control.  Requires that your software 
  2148			support XON/XOFF signaling.
  2149		&H3     Use both hardware and software flow control.  If you are 
  2150			unsure about what your equipment supports, select this 
  2151			option.  But keep the warning, above, in mind about software 
  2152			flow control.
  2153	
  2154	Received Data Flow Control
  2155	Separate commands, &Rn (hardware) and &In (software), control the flow of 
  2156	Received Data passed by the Courier to your computer or terminal.
  2157	
  2158	Your software and machine must support whichever type you select, although 
  2159	we recommend hardware flow control, if possible.
  2160	
  2161	   Hardware Control(&Rn)
  2162	     &R0     Delay Clear to Send Response after Request to Send signal 
  2163		     (RTS/CTS delay).  The delay is required by some synchronous 
  2164		     mainframes and does not apply to asynchronous calls.
  2165	     &R1     The modem ignores RTS.  This setting is required if your 
  2166		     computer or terminal or software does not support RTS.
  2167	     &R2     Hardware flow control of received data enabled.  Default.  
  2168		     The modem sends data to the computer or terminal only on 
  2169		     receipt of the RTS signal.
  2170	
  2171	   Software Control (&In)
  2172	     WARNING:  In ordinary operation, the only characters the modem 
  2173	     recognizes during a call are the three pluses (+++) of the escape 
  2174	     code.  But when software flow control is enabled, the modem also looks 
  2175	     for <Ctrl>-S or <Ctrl>-Q characters.  If these characters occur in a 
  2176	     file or as part of a protocol, the modem reads them as XON/XOFF 
  2177	     characters and acts on them.  In some cases, the modem drops them 
  2178	     from the data stream.
  2179	
  2180	     &I0     Disables XON/XOFF flow control of received data.  Default.  
  2181		     Recommended for non-ARQ (Normal mode) calls, but see &I5.  
  2182		     The I0 option provides transparency for all characters except 
  2183		     the escape code sequence (+++), because at this setting the 
  2184		     modem does not look for control characters.
  2185	       
  2186		     NOTE:  Because of the risk described in the above warning, the 
  2187		     settings that follow are only recommended for users whose data 
  2188		     does not include XON/XOFF control characters.
  2189	
  2190	     &I1     The Courier acts on your typed XON/XOFF commands, <Ctrl>-S or 
  2191		     <Ctrl>-Q, and passes them to the remote computer.  Use in ARQ 
  2192		     mode only, but keep in mind that the XON/XOFF characters sent 
  2193		     to the remote computer may interfere with XON/XOFF signaling 
  2194		     between the remote computer and remote modem.  See &I2.
  2195	
  2196	     &I2     The Courier acts on your XON/XOFF commands, but removes them 
  2197		     from the data stream instead of passing them to the remote 
  2198		     computer.  This ensures that the remote computer does not 
  2199		     confuse your XON/XOFF characters with those from its attached 
  2200		     modem.  This is the recommended setting for ARQ mode.
  2201	
  2202		     However, if the call is not in ARQ mode, there is no flow 
  2203		     control on the phone link.  If you send an XOFF to your modem 
  2204		    and it stops passing data, it has no way to tell the remote 
  2205		     computer and modem to stop sending for a while, and your 
  2206		     modem's buffer may overflow.  For more reliable control in 
  2207		     non-ARQ mode, see &I5.
  2208	
  2209	     &I3     Hewlett PackardSYMBOL 190 \f "Symbol"Host mode.  Applies only 
  2210		     to modems attached to an HP mainframe that uses the ENQ/ACK 
  2211		     protocol.  Use in ARQ mode only.  See Appendix G.
  2212	
  2213	     &I4     Hewlett PackardSYMBOL 190 \f "Symbol"Terminal mode.  Applies 
  2214		     only to modems attached to terminals in an HP system that uses 
  2215		     the ENQ/ACK protocol.  Use in ARQ mode only.  See Appendix G.
  2216	
  2217	     &I5     This setting is designed to enable flow control on the phone 
  2218		     link when the connection is not under error control.  For this 
  2219		     to work for you, the remote modem must also have &I5 capability.
  2220	
  2221		     In ARQ mode, a Courier set to &I5 operates the same as it does 
  2222		     when set to &I2.  It acts on your XON/XOFF commands, but does 
  2223		     not pass them to the remote system.  The error control protocol 
  2224		     enables the modems to control the flow of data on the phone 
  2225		     link.
  2226	       
  2227		     In non-ARQ mode, a Courier set to &I5 operates as though flow 
  2228		     control were disabled (&I0);  it does not look for your typed 
  2229		     XON/XOFF commands.  However, it looks for XON/XOFF characters 
  2230		     coming in over the phone link.  When the remote operator sends 
  2231		     XON/XOFF commands, the Courier either resumes or stops 
  2232		     transmitting data over the link and drops the characters from 
  2233		     the data stream.
  2234	
  2235		     If both modems are set to &I5, operators at each end can signal 
  2236		     the remote modem to stop sending, thereby controlling the data 
  2237		     flow on the phone link and preventing their own modem's buffer 
  2238		     from overflowing.  At the computer or terminal/modem 
  2239		     interfaces, the modems independently control the flow of 
  2240		     data through their Transmit Data (&H) settings.
  2241	
  2242	   Guidelines
  2243	     Use of software flow control may prove satisfactory if you're only 
  2244	     transferring text files.  However, if you're transferring non-text 
  2245	     (binary) files, or using an Xmodem-type protocol, disable flow control 
  2246	     entirely (&R1, &I0).  In addition, set the modem to &B0 and &N0, so 
  2247	     that the serial port and connection rates are equal.
  2248

  2276	TESTING
  2277	
  2278	The modem can perform a number of tests including Analog Loopback, Digital 
  2279	Loopback, and Remote Digital Loopback.  These tests can be used to check 
  2280	the operations of the modem's transmitter and receiver, or to locate a

  2287	INTERNATIONAL CALLS
  2288	
  2289	There are three commands that apply to international calls above 1200 
  2290	bps--Bn, &Gn, &Pn.  Bn is described earlier in this chapter.
  2291	
  2292	&Gn     This setting applies only to overseas calls at 2400 or 1200 bps.  
  2293		British phone switching systems require the modem to send an 1800 
  2294		Hz guard tone after it sends an answer tone.  Some other European 
  2295		phone networks require a 550 Hz guard tone.  Guard tones are not 
  2296		used in the United States or Canada.
  2297	
  2298		&G0     No guard tone.  This is used in the U.S. and in Canada.  
  2299			Default.
  2300		&G1     This sets a 550 Hz guard tone, and is used in some European 
  2301			countries.
  2302		&G2     This sets an 1800 Hz guard tone, and is used in the U.K. 
  2303			and some Commonwealth countries.  &G2 requires the B0 
  2304			setting.
  2305	
  2306	&Pn     This command sets the ratio of the off-hook/on-hook (make/break) 
  2307		interval for pulse dialing.  The default sets the modem for use in 
  2308		North America.  The ratio must be changed if the modem is used 
  2309		in the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth countries.
  2310	
  2311		&P0     Make/break ratio, U.S./Canada:  39%/61%.  Default.  
  2312		&P1     Make/break ratio, United Kingdom, some Commonwealth 
  2313			countries:  33%/67%.

  2326		K1      Return actual time at ATI3.  Clock is set using 
  2327			ATI3=HH:MM:SS K1.
  2328	
  2329	&Yn     Break handling.  This command allows you to send a break to abort 
  2330		data transfer without disconnecting from the phone link.
  2331		&Y0     Destructive, don't send Break.
  2332		&Y1     Destructive, expedited (Default).
  2333		&Y2     Nondestructive, expedited.
  2334		&Y3     Nondestructive, unexpedited; modem sends Break in sequence 
  2335			with data received from computer or terminal.
  2336	
  2337		NOTE:  If the call is under MNP5 data compression, destructive 
  2338		Breaks cause both modems to reset their data compression tables.  
  2339		When transmission resumes, the modems build new tables, and the 
  2340		result is lower than normal throughput.

  2342	&ZC=s  Write the following command string s to NVRAM.  The command string 
  2343	       may be up to 30 characters long; spaces are not counted.  This 
  2344	       command can be used so that you can call another modem without 
  2345	       loading your communications software.
  2346	
  2347	       After storing a command, you can program the voice/data switch to 
  2348	       execute the stored command string when pressed.  The following 
  2349	       example assigns a command string that displays the link diagnostics 
  2350	       screen when you press the voice/data switch.  
  2351	       
  2352		      AT&ZC=I6 <Enter>
  2353	
  2354	       The function of the voice/data switch is determined by the setting 
  2355	       of Register S32, as described in Appendix G.  Set the voice/data 
  2356	       switch function to execute stored command string by setting Register 
  2357	       S32 to 9 with the following command:
  2358	
  2359		      ATS32=9 <Enter>
  2360	
  2361	       Note that you can reset the voice/data switch at any time to one of 
  2362	       the other available functions.  Additionally, you can overwrite the 
  2363	       stored command string with a new one at any time.
  2364	
  2365	       Once you've stored your command string and set Register S32, all 
  2366	       you need to do is press the voice/data switch whenever you want 
  2367	       the command string executed.
  2368	
  2369	&ZC?    Display the stored command string.
  2370	
  2371	%T      Enables the modem, when off hook, to detect the tone frequencies of 
  2372		dialing modems.  %T is meant primarily for use with network 
  2373		applications, but may also be integrated into certain software 
  2374		programs.  For example, %T could be used in a security program to 
  2375		identify incoming tone security codes.
  2376	
  2377		To enable %T, type ATH1 <Enter> to force the modem off hook.  Then 
  2378		type AT%T <Enter>.  
  2379	
  2380		To return the modem to Command mode, press any key or drop the 
  2381		computer's or terminal's DTR signal.  The modem responds OK.

  2404	********************
  2405	Fax Modem Guidelines
  2406	Fax operations require facsimile-compatible software that can send or 
  2407	receive Group III faxes.  Follow the instructions in your fax software 
  2408	manual.
  2409	
  2410	The modem's normal operating mode is Data mode.  If your fax software 
  2411	is typical, it automatically switches the modem to Fax mode when you 
  2412	run the program, and resets the modem to Data mode when you exit the 
  2413	program.
  2414	
  2415	If you have a problem, however, and think the modem may be in the 
  2416	wrong mode, you can use one of the following AT commands to manually 
  2417	switch the modem:
  2418	
  2419	        AT+FCLASS=0 (Switch to Data mode) <Enter>
  2420	        AT+FCLASS=1 (Switch to Class 1 Fax mode) <Enter>
  2421	        AT+FCLASS=2.0 (Switch to Class 2.0 Fax mode) <Enter>
  2422	
  2423	If you are not sure whether the modem is in Data or Fax mode, type the 
  2424	following command.
  2425	
  2426	       AT+FCLASS? <Enter>
  2427	
  2428	The modem  returns a value of 0 to indicate Data mode,  1 to indicate 
  2429	Class 1 Fax mode, or 2.0 to indicate Class 2.0 Fax mode.
  2430	
  2431	NOTE:  Whenever the fax modem is reset using the ATZ command, by toggling 
  2432	the DTR signal, or by turning the power off and on, the modem will be set 
  2433	to Data mode.
  2434	
  2435	*****************************
  2436	Fax Mode Flow Control Setting
  2437	Many facsimile software products use software flow control when the 
  2438	modem is in Fax mode.  Throughout our documentation, we recommend that 
  2439	you use hardware flow control for Data mode (factory setting).  However, 
  2440	to allow compatibility with software products that use software flow 
  2441	control by default, U.S. Robotics fax modems now automatically change 
  2442	to software flow control when entering Fax mode.
  2443	
  2444	**********
  2445	FCC Notice
  2446	FCC part 68, rules regarding fax operation, has been amended as follows:  
  2447	Telephone facsimile machines--identification of the sender of the message:  
  2448	
  2449	It shall be unlawful for any person within the United States to use a 
  2450	computer or other electronic device to send any message via a telephone 
  2451	facsimile machine unless such a message clearly contains, in a margin at 
  2452	the top or bottom of each transmitted page or on the first page of the 
  2453	transmission, the date and time it is sent and an identification of the 
  2454	business, other entity, or individual sending the message and the 
  2455	telephone number of the sending machine or of such business, other 
  2456	entity, or individual.  Telephone facsimile machines manufactured on 
  2457	and after December 20, 1992 must clearly mark such identifying information 
  2458	on each transmitted page.

  2483	Call Detection
  2484	Courier High Speed modems support Call Detection, which is a method of 
  2485	reporting whether an incoming call is Data, Fax Class 1, or Fax Class 2.0.  
  2486	It is especially useful for Bulletin Board systems, as it automates 
  2487	recognition of different calls from multiple users.
  2488	
  2489	Call Detection is an optional Service Class 2.0 feature, and is also 
  2490	implemented by U.S. Robotics for Fax Class 1 applications.
  2491	
  2492	To obtain a copy of the technical specification of U.S. Robotics' 
  2493	implementation of Call Detection for Fax Class 1, call our BBS at 
  2494	(708) 982-5092 and download the file CALLSEL.TXT.
  2495	
  2496	For information on implementing Fax Class 2.0 Call Detection, see the 
  2497	standard listed above.  For a list of the optional Fax Class 2.0

  2514	I0      The modem returns a 4-digit product code.  If you have a problem and 
  2515	        call U.S. Robotics' Technical Support Department, you may be asked 
  2516	        for this product code.
  2517	
  2518	I1      The modem performs a checksum of its read-only memory (ROM) and 
  2519	        returns the result to the screen.  This function is used only in 
  2520	        factory testing.  The modem should always read the same number. 
  2521	
  2522	I2      The modem performs a test of its random access memory (RAM) and 
  2523	        returns either the OK (0) or ERROR (4) result code, followed by OK 
  2524	        when the test is completed.  You may want to use this command as a 
  2525	        checkpoint if the modem appears to be malfunctioning.
  2526	
  2527	I3      The modem returns the duration of the last call if set to K0.  It 
  2528	        displays the actual time if set to K1.  See the description of the 
  2529	        Kn command in Chapter 4.

  2626	high and low speed channels.  At this time, online fallback is only 
  2627	reported Enabled in HST-mode.
  2628	
  2629	Most terms used in the display are self-explanatory except for the 
  2630	following:
  2631	
  2632	Octets:  
  2633	         Compressed data units.  If the number of octets is greater than 
  2634	         the number of characters sent, the modems probably used MNP5 
  2635	         compression on an already compressed file, and the result was 
  2636	         expanded data.  
  2637	
  2638	Line Reversals:  
  2639	         The number of times HST-mode modems switched the high 
  2640	         and low speed channels.
  2641	
  2642	Blers:  
  2643	         Errors in data and protocol blocks.  If there were many block 
  2644	         errors, your receiver may have experienced problems on the line.
  2645	
  2646	Blocks Resent:  
  2647	         These represent blocks the remote modem resent due to 
  2648	         the previous category, Blers.
  2649	
  2650	Link Timeouts:  
  2651	         Protocol detection problems:  communications were 
  2652	         severed momentarily, and the modems probably recovered.  
  2653	         This does not indicate the retry timeout.
  2654	
  2655	Link Naks:  
  2656	         Negative acknowledgments (one or more blocks).
  2657	
  2658	Data Compression:  
  2659	         Indicates the type of data compression negotiated 
  2660	         for the call (V42BIS or MNP5) or NONE.  A V42BIS 
  2661	         response includes the size of the dictionary and the 
  2662	         maximum string length used, for example, 2048/32.  
  2663	         See Appendix A for more information.
  2664	
  2665	Equalization Long/Short:  
  2666	         Status of S15 bit 0; long if bit 0=0, short 
  2667	         if bit 0=1.  Short equalization applies 
  2668	         only to HST modems.
  2669	
  2670	Fallback:  
  2671	         Enabled/Disabled:  indicates whether or not the modems 
  2672	         negotiated online fallback during the connection sequence.
  2673	
  2674	Protocol:  
  2675	         indicates the error control protocol negotiated (LAPM, 
  2676	         ST, MNP, NONE) or SYNC for a synchronous call.
  2677	
  2678	Speed:  
  2679	         The last rates at which the receiver/transmitter were operating 
  2680	         before disconnecting.
  2681	
  2682	Disconnect Reason:  
  2683	         Possible reasons the modem hung up are as follows:
  2684	
  2685	         A Rootless Tree:  
  2686	              The modem received an invalid V.42 bis (compression) 
  2687	              frame.
  2688	
  2689	         Break Timeout:  
  2690	              Incompatible processing of a Break signal occurred.
  2691	
  2692	         DISC:  
  2693	              The remote modem sent a V.42 Disconnect frame.
  2694	
  2695	         DTR dropped:  
  2696	              The computer or terminal dropped the Data Terminal 
  2697	              Ready signal, terminating the call.
  2698	
  2699	         Escape code:  
  2700	              The operator sent the modem the +++ escape code.
  2701	
  2702	         Extra Stepup:  
  2703	              The modem received an invalid V.42 bis (compression) 
  2704	              frame.
  2705	
  2706	         GSTN (General Switch Telephone Network) Clear Down:  
  2707	              The connection was non-ARQ and DTR was dropped from one side 
  2708	              of the connection, or the DISC frame was corrupted due to 
  2709	              noise.
  2710	
  2711	         Illegal Command Code:  
  2712	              The modem received an invalid V.42 bis (compression) frame.
  2713	
  2714	         Inactivity timeout:  
  2715	              The modem detected no activity on the line for 
  2716	              the duration specified in Register S19 (default is 0, 
  2717	              timer disabled).
  2718	
  2719	         Invalid Codeword:  
  2720	              The modem received an invalid V.42 bis (compression) frame.
  2721	
  2722	         Invalid speed:  
  2723	              The modem is set to &N1 or higher, for a fixed 
  2724	              link rate, and the remote modem is not operating at the 
  2725	              same rate.
  2726	
  2727	         LD received:  
  2728	              The remote modem sent an MNP error control Link 
  2729	             Disconnect request.
  2730	
  2731	         Loop loss disconnect:  
  2732	              The modem detected a loss of current on the 
  2733	              loop connecting it with the telephone company central 
  2734	              office.  This usually occurs because the remote modem has 
  2735	              hung up:  the central office drops current momentarily 
  2736	              when there is a disconnect at the other end of a call.  
  2737	              Unless Register S38 is set higher than zero, the modem 
  2738	              immediately hangs up at loop loss.
  2739	
  2740	         Loss of carrier:  
  2741	              The modem detected loss of the remote modem's 
  2742	              carrier and waited the duration specified in Register 
  2743	              S10 (default is 0.7 seconds).
  2744	
  2745	         MNP incompatibility:  
  2746	              The modem is set to &M5 and the remote modem 
  2747	              does not have MNP capability, or there was an MNP 
  2748	              negotiation procedure error.
  2749	
  2750	         Retransmit limit:  
  2751	              The modems reached the maximum of twelve attempts 
  2752	              to transfer a data frame without error.
  2753	         
  2754	         SABME Timeout (Set Asynchronous Balance Mode Extended):  
  2755	              The modems failed this part of V.42 link negotiation. 
  2756	       
  2757	         Unable to Retrain:  
  2758	              After several attempts, disturbances on the phone 
  2759	              line prevented the modems from retraining, and they could 
  2760	              no longer transmit or receive data.
  2761	
  2762	         XID Timeout:  
  2763	              The modems failed to negotiate the V.42 Detection 
  2764	              (XID Exchange) phase. 
  2765	
  2766	Dial Security Disconnect Reason:  
  2767	    Possible reasons the answering modem may have hung up during a 
  2768	    Dial Security session are as follows:
  2769	
  2770	    Security Abort:  
  2771	         The modem hung up because it received an invalid 
  2772	         password three times.
  2773	
  2774	    Prompting Not Enabled:  
  2775	         The modem hung up because the originating 
  2776	         modem did not send an autopass password, and prompting wasn't 
  2777	         enabled.
  2778	
  2779	    No Prompting in Sync:  
  2780	         The originating modem did not send an autopass 
  2781	         password, and the answering modem cannot prompt for a password 
  2782	         in any synchronous mode.
  2783	
  2784	    Non-ARQ Mode:  
  2785	         The modem hung up because the originating modem was 
  2786	         set for error control and the answering modem was set for 
  2787	         non-error control.
  2788	
  2789	    Mode Incompatible:  
  2790	         The modem hung up because both modems were not 
  2791	         set to the same error control setting.
  2792	
  2793	    No Prompting in Non-ARQ:  
  2794	         Prompting was enabled, but the modem hung 
  2795	         up because the originating modem was set for error control, 
  2796	         and the answering modem was set for non-error control.  The 
  2797	         answering modem cannot prompt when it is set for non-error 
  2798	         control.   
  2799	
  2800	I7      The modem returns a product configuration.  If you have a problem

  3052	Appendix A--Link Negotiation (Handshaking) and Error Control
  3053	
  3054	
  3055	This appendix includes information on how U.S. Robotics modems  
  3056	negotiate with remote modems for the rate and other characteristics 
  3057	of each connection.   In addition, you'll find information on error 
  3058	control and, especially useful, some statistics and guidelines on 
  3059	using the modem for the best throughput.
  3060	
  3061	Some of the following text includes the term ARQ, which means Automatic 
  3062	Repeat Request.  ARQ is a method used in many error control protocols to 
  3063	ensure that any data that has been corrupted in transit is retransmitted.  
  3064	We use the term in our documentation to designate a connection under 
  3065	error control.
  3066	
  3067	NOTE:  High speed calls are highly vulnerable to errors unless the 
  3068	data is protected by error control.  The V. protocol operations 
  3069	described below take place even if one of the modems is not set for 
  3070	error control, thereby prohibiting error control for the call.  
  3071	If your modem connects with a modem at high speed but without error 
  3072	control, and if you are not using an error control protocol for 
  3073	your call, you may lose data.    
  3074	
  3075	Dual Standard modems in HST mode, in contrast, are unable to connect 
  3076	with other HST modems at higher than 2400 bps, unless error control 
  3077	is negotiated for the call.  
  3078	 
  3079	****************
  3080	V.34 Handshaking
  3081	The Courier defaults to V.34 and tries for the highest possible speed 
  3082	when it attempts to connect with another modem, 28.8K bps.  The entire 
  3083	V.FC range comprises 28.8K, 26.4K, 24K, 21.6K, 19.2K, 16.8K, 14.4K, 
  3084	9600, 7200, 4800, and 2400 bps.   If the remote modem is not V.34 
  3085	capable, a connection is made using the highest compatible modulation 
  3086	scheme (V.FC, V.32 terbo, V.32 bis, and so on, down to as low as Bell 
  3087	103, or 300 bps). 
  3088	
  3089	If the remote modem has V.34 capability, the two modems use a line 
  3090	probing technique to determine the highest speed possible under 
  3091	current line conditions, and complete the connection.  If the remote 
  3092	modem does not have V.34 capability, a calling Courier modem listens 
  3093	to the other modem's answer tones to identify what standard rate the 
  3094	remote modem is operating at, and adjusts to that rate.  An answering 
  3095	Courier modem sends out a series of answer tone signals until both modems 
  3096	can negotiate the best connection rate.
  3097	
  3098	******************************** 
  3099	V. Fast Class (V.FC) Handshaking
  3100	The Courier defaults to V.Fast Class and tries for the highest 
  3101	possible speed when it attempts to connect with another modem, 
  3102	28.8K bps.  The entire V.FC range comprises 28.8K, 26.4K, 24K, 
  3103	21.6K, 19.2K, 16.8K, and 14.4K bps.   If the remote modem is not 
  3104	V.FC capable, a connection is made using the highest compatible 
  3105	modulation scheme (V.32 terbo, V.32 bis, and so on, down to as 
  3106	low as Bell 103, or 300 bps). 
  3107	
  3108	If the remote modem has V.FC capability, the two modems use a line 
  3109	probing technique to determine the highest speed possible under 
  3110	current line conditions, and complete the connection.  If the 
  3111	remote modem does not have V.FC capability, a calling Courier modem 
  3112	listens to the other modem's answer tones to identify what standard 
  3113	rate the remote modem is operating at, and adjusts to that rate.  An 
  3114	answering Courier modem sends out a series of answer tone signals 
  3115	until both modems can negotiate the best connection rate.
  3116	 
  3117	****************************************************
  3118	U.S. Robotics V.32 terbo to U.S. Robotics V.32 terbo
  3119	On these connections, Couriers have two features that result in 
  3120	outstanding performance:  Quick Connect and Adaptive Speed Leveling 
  3121	(ASL).  
  3122	
  3123	Quick Connect allows the modems to connect in approximately 7 seconds, 
  3124	a far shorter time than normal with most modems.  
  3125	
  3126	ASL (described below in Other V.Protocol Operations) is used by U.S. 
  3127	Robotics modems operating in V.32 terbo and V.32 bis modes.
  3128	
  3129	****************************
  3130	Other V. Protocol Operations
  3131	Earlier, lower-speed V. protocols do not employ line probing.  Instead,  
  3132	they use predefined answer tones to specify, or identify, speed 
  3133	capabilities.  These protocols define the following maximum speeds.
  3134	
  3135	*  V.32 terbo:  19.2K bps, with an additional Courier-to-Courier 
  3136	   speed of 21.6K bps.
  3137	*  V.32 bis:  14.4K bps.
  3138	*  V.32:  9600 bps.
  3139	
  3140	ASL (used in V.32 terbo and V.32 bis modes) is a strategy that allows 
  3141	the modems' receivers and transmitters to act independently of each 
  3142	other.  We have always featured a fallback/fall forward feature with 
  3143	error-correcting modems that allows them to slow down if there are 
  3144	problems with the phone line, in order to avoid data errors, and then 
  3145	speed up again.  But the independence of the receiving and transmitting 
  3146	channels means that one channel or the other may slow down and then speed 
  3147	up, without affecting the data flow on the other.  The result is more 
  3148	efficient line operation. 
  3149	
  3150	WARNING:  Answering V.32 terbo modems shift their serial port rate up 
  3151	to 38.4K (for 21.6K connections) if the calling V.32 terbo modem dials 
  3152	in at 21.6K.  The answering V.32 terbo modem then sends data to its 
  3153	computer at 38.4K bps.   V.32 bis modems shift their serial port rate 
  3154	to 19.2K bps in order to make 14.4K bps connections.  If your ocomputer 
  3155	or terminal does not support these higher serial port rates, you need 
  3156	to disable V.32 terbo and/or V.32 bis.  See Appendix B, Register S34.
  3157	
  3158	NOTE:  While many modems on the market now use the more efficient 
  3159	speeds, there may be a problem in answering older, "dumb" V.32 
  3160	modems at 9600 bps.  Register S28 is used to modify the duration 
  3161	of the extra tones used in V.32 negotiations, in the rare instance 
  3162	that this may be necessary.  See S-Registers, in Appendix B.
  3163	
  3164	*************************
  3165	Dual Standard Handshaking
  3166	We  recommend that Dual Standard modems be set to retain the default 
  3167	B0 and &N0 settings.  This allows them to connect with V. protocol 
  3168	modems and HST modems in both Originate and Answer modes at a variety 
  3169	of speeds.  
  3170	
  3171	An originating Dual Standard modem set to B1 sends out a Bell answer 
  3172	tone, which is the prevalent standard in the U.S. and Canada for 
  3173	connections at 2400 bps and lower.   At higher speeds, the Dual 
  3174	Standard also recognizes the ITU answer tones necessary for 
  3175	connecting with V. protocol modems, and adjusts to the answering 
  3176	modem.  
  3177	
  3178	However, in Answer mode, a Dual Standard modem sending out the Bell 
  3179	answer tone (B1) won't be recognized by V. protocol modems.  The 
  3180	calling V. protocol modem, instead, will wait until it detects a 
  3181	tone it recognizes, the V.22 bis tone used at 2400 bps.   If you 
  3182	wish to have your Dual Standard connect with V. protocol modems at 
  3183	high speeds, make sure it is set to B0 for the ITU answer tones.  
  3184	It will also connect with HST modems at speeds up to 16.8K bps.
  3185	 
  3186	****************************
  3187	Error Control and Throughput
  3188	
  3189	Error control is available for calls at 1200 bps and above.  It can be 
  3190	disabled, although high speed calls (above 2400 bps) should always 
  3191	be under error control.  The operations defined in an error control 
  3192	protocol include the following:
  3193	
  3194	*  Establishment of compatibility 
  3195	*  Data frame formatting
  3196	*  Error detection through Cyclic Redundancy Checking (CRC)
  3197	*  Retransmission of corrupt data frames
  3198	
  3199	The Courier is set at the factory to &M4, causing it to try for an error 
  3200	control connection and, if that isn't possible, to proceed with the call 
  3201	in Normal mode.  The modem first tries for a V.42 connection, then an 
  3202	MNP connection.  The following information is based on the Courier's 
  3203	setting of &M4.
  3204	
  3205	****************
  3206	V.42 Handshaking
  3207	This international standard includes a two-stage handshaking process: 
  3208	
  3209	*  A Detection phase that is based on an exchange of predefined characters.  
  3210	*  LAPM (Link Access Procedures for Modems) Negotiation.  In this phase, 
  3211	   the modems identify their capabilities concerning maximum data block 
  3212	   size and the number of outstanding data blocks allowed before an 
  3213	   acknowledgment is required.
  3214	 
  3215	***************
  3216	MNP Handshaking
  3217	This protocol is supported by the ITU-T V.42 Recommendation.  It was 
  3218	originally developed by Microcom, Inc. and is now in the public domain.  
  3219	
  3220	MNP is based on special protocol frames.  If the remote modem doesn't 
  3221	recognize an MNP Link Request, error control isn't possible. (In HST 
  3222	asymmetrical mode, U.S. Robotics modems use a proprietary scheme 
  3223	similar to MNP.)
  3224	 
  3225	****************
  3226	Data Compression
  3227	If the modems successfully establish a V.42 connection, they also negotiate 
  3228	for V.42 bis data compression.  If they successfully establish an MNP 
  3229	connection, they negotiate for MNP5 data compression.  The type of 
  3230	compression for a call, if any, is reported in the ATI6 display, and 
  3231	in the CONNECT message if the modem is set to &A3.
  3232	
  3233	Modems using V.42 bis compression negotiate the following options and 
  3234	report them in the ATI6 display.
  3235	
  3236	*  Dictionary size, that is, the amount of memory available for compression 
  3237	   table entries.  (Entries are codes devised for redundant data.  The 
  3238	   data is packed into shorter data units, called code words, and unpacked 
  3239	   by the receiving modem.)
  3240	
  3241	   Possible sizes are as follows:  
  3242	         Bits    Entries
  3243	         9       512
  3244	         10      1024
  3245	         11      2048
  3246	
  3247	   U.S. Robotics modems use 11-bit, or 2048-entry dictionary, but drop down 
  3248	   if the remote modem uses a 9- or 10- bit dictionary.  The size of the 
  3249	   dictionary for a call is reported in the ATI6 display.
  3250	
  3251	*  Maximum string length of each entry.  As the dictionary fills, the 
  3252	   modem deletes the oldest unused strings.
  3253	
  3254	V.42 bis compression is more efficient than MNP5 compression in part 
  3255	because it dynamically deletes entries that are no longer used.  In 
  3256	addition, it works better with files that are already compressed. 
  3257	These include .ZIP files downloaded from many Bulletin Boards and 
  3258	8-bit binary files, which seem to the modem to be compressed.  
  3259	   
  3260	MNP5 compression should not be used with such files because it adds data 
  3261	to them, which lessens throughput.  (The additional data is stripped when 
  3262	the file is decompressed by the remote modem.)  When transferring 
  3263	such files, it's best to set the modem to &K3:  this allows V.42 bis 
  3264	compression to work dynamically with the compressed data, but disables 
  3265	MNP5.
  3266	 
  3267	************
  3268	Flow Control
  3269	Flow control of data from the computer is required under error control 
  3270	for two reasons:
  3271	
  3272	1. The transmitting modem buffers a copy of each frame it transmits to 
  3273	   the remote end until it is acknowledged by the receiving modem.
  3274	
  3275	2. If errors are encountered, retransmission activity can cause a 
  3276	   steady stream of data from the computer to overflow the buffer. 
  3277	
  3278	*********************
  3279	Throughput Guidelines 
  3280	The following guidelines should help to make the most of the modem's 
  3281	advanced performance features.  In many instances, experimentation 
  3282	and experience will indicate what works best for your applications.
  3283	
  3284	1. Optimal throughput is attained under the following conditions:
  3285	   
  3286	   *  The communications software allows fixing the serial port rate 
  3287	      higher than the connection rate, by setting the software to 
  3288	      115.2K, 57.6K, or 38.4K bps and setting the modem to &B1.
  3289	
  3290	      If the software automatically switches serial port rates to follow 
  3291	      the connection rate, the modem's serial port rate must be also set 
  3292	      to follow the connection rate for each call, &B0, and throughput 
  3293	      will be limited. 
  3294	
  3295	      Installations with specialized software may want to enable a fixed 
  3296	      serial port rate for ARQ calls and a variable serial port rate for 
  3297	      non-ARQ calls.  See the &B2 command in Chapter 4.
  3298	
  3299	   *  The call is under data compression.  
  3300	   
  3301	   *  The data is comprised of text files rather than binary files such 
  3302	      as .EXE or .COM files.  See the table at the end of this appendix. 
  3303	
  3304	2. MNP5 compression is disabled for files that are already compressed, 
  3305	   and 8-bit binary files that appear to the modem to be already compressed.  
  3306	   MNP5 is disabled by setting the modem to &K3. 
  3307	
  3308	3. The file transfer is not slowed down by a file-transfer protocol.  
  3309	   Many non-text files require a file transfer protocol, but the results 
  3310	   vary.  For example, certain public domain file transfer protocols 
  3311	   have the following effects:
  3312	
  3313	   Kermit  Newer versions support packets up to 9K and a sliding window 
  3314	           design to eliminate turn-around delay.  With earlier versions, 
  3315	           however, throughput may be severely reduced due to short block 
  3316	           lengths (possibly under 128 bytes) and acknowledgment 
  3317	            turnaround time.
  3318	
  3319	   Xmodem  Throughput may be reduced if your version uses short block 
  3320	           lengths (128 bytes).  Some versions use larger blocks 
  3321	           (1K blocks).  Throughput is also reduced by overhead (error 
  3322	           control protocol information).
  3323	
  3324	   Ymodem  There is an improvement over Xmodem, due to larger block 
  3325	           lengths (1K bytes), but throughput is still reduced by the 
  3326	           protocol's error control overhead.
  3327	
  3328	   The above protocols further reduce throughput when an error control 
  3329	   connection is established.  The accuracy of the data is checked both 
  3330	   by the file transfer protocol and the modem.  To avoid redundancy, 
  3331	   use the above protocols only for non-ARQ connections, and only at 
  3332	   speeds of 2400 bps and below.  
  3333	   
  3334	   For the best throughput, but on error-controlled connections only and 
  3335	   with hardware flow control, we recommend the most current version of 
  3336	   Zmodem.  Overhead is minimal with this protocol, with throughput 
  3337	   almost equal to that obtained with no file-transfer protocol.  Zmodem 
  3338	   should also be used for non-ARQ connections.  Leave the modem at its 
  3339	   &M4 and &K1 settings for both error control and data compression.  
  3340	   Ymodem-G is another good choice, but never without both the local 
  3341	   and remote modems using error control:  if Ymodem-G detects an error, 
  3342	   it aborts the transfer.  Do not use either protocol with software flow 
  3343	   control (XON/XOFF signaling).

  3345	******************
  3346	Typical Throughput
  3347	The maximum connection rate between two V.34 modems is 28.8K bps.  
  3348	Ocassionally, connections occur at 26.4K, 24K, and 21.6K bps because 
  3349	line quality differs from location to location  Line conditions and 
  3350	data rate affect throughput.  Also remember, your serial port rate 
  3351	must match or exceed your connection rate.  If you set your serial port 
  3352	rate at 19.2K bps, the V.34 modem will only connect at or below 19.2K bps.
  3353	
  3354	The tables below indicate the typical throughput, in characters per 
  3355	second (cps), that can be expected under the following conditions.  
  3356	
  3357	*  Connection (link) rates of 14.4K, 21.6K, and 28.8K bps, respectively
  3358	*  Serial port rates set at 57.6K bps for the 14.4K bps connection and 
  3359	   115.2K bps for the 21.6K and 28.8K bps connections
  3360	*  Modem set to &B1 (fixed serial port rate)
  3361	*  V.42 bis compression negotiated for the call, and the default size 
  3362	   11-bit, 2048-entry dictionary
  3363	*  Straight data (not already compressed, no file-transfer protocol)
  3364	*  Transmission from a fast (486) computer
  3365	
  3366	NOTE:  .ZIP files that are already compressed or files that appear to 
  3367	the modem to be compressed yield lower throughput.  We recommend 
  3368	setting the modem to &K3 when transferring these files, to allow V.42 
  3369	bis but disable MNP5.

  3407	THE RS-232 INTERFACE
  3408	
  3409	***********
  3410	Description
  3411	The RS-232 interface is a standard developed by the Electronic 
  3412	Industries Association (EIA).  It defines the signals and voltages 
  3413	used when data is exchanged between a computer or terminal and a 
  3414	modem or serial printer.  Data is transmitted between the devices 
  3415	via a cable with 25-pin, 9-pin, 8-pin or custom-built connectors.
  3416	
  3417	The modem takes a DB-25P (25-pin plug, or male) connector at one 
  3418	end of the cable.  Computer equipment varies, however.  Check the 
  3419	serial port at the rear of your machine, which may be labeled serial, 
  3420	comm port, or some other term (e.g., RS-232).  If there are no labels, 
  3421	review your machine documentation to find out which is the serial port.  
  3422	(There may be more than one.)  Don't use a port marked parallel, 
  3423	printer or aux.  
  3424	
  3425	The physical serial port on the computer or terminal will be either a 
  3426	socket (female) or plug (male) that typically accommodates 25 or 9 
  3427	pins.  For example, the port on the IBM PC, PC/XT and most compatibles 
  3428	requires a DB-25S (socket) connector, while the port on the IBM PC/AT 
  3429	and some compatibles requires a DB-9S connector.  Apple computers 
  3430	require a DB-25P, DB-9P or, more typically, an 8-pin round plug connector.  
  3431	Check your computer documentation or with your computer dealer.
  3432	
  3433	***************
  3434	Pin Assignments
  3435	The entire standard covers many more functions than are used in most 
  3436	data communications applications.  Pin assignments are factory set 
  3437	in the Courier to match the standard DB-25 assignments in the 
  3438	following table.  DB-9 connectors for AT-compatible computers 
  3439	should be wired at the computer end of the cable as shown in the 
  3440	DB-9 column.  If you're using an Apple computer, we strongly recommend 
  3441	that you purchase a Hardware Handshaking cable to get the highest 
  3442	possible reliability performance.

  3467	*******************
  3468	Minimum Requirements
  3469	Some computer/terminal equipment supports only a few of the RS-232 signal 
  3470	functions set in the Courier.  The minimum required for the modem to 
  3471	operate are as follows: 
  3472	  
  3473	Asynchronous Calls
  3474	       DB-25   DB-9

  3479		20      4       Data Terminal Ready*
  3480	
  3481	   * Required only if you have the Data Terminal Ready Operations 
  3482	     switch OFF (DIP switch 1 OFF).
  3483	
  3484	Synchronous Calls
  3485	You will need all of the above functions as well as pin 15 for 
  3486	Transmitter timing signals, and pin 17 for Receiver timing signals.  
  3487	You may need pin 24, which is assigned the external timing source, 
  3488	rather than the internal (modem) source assigned to pin 15.  See 
  3489	Appendix F for more detailed information.
  3490	
  3491	Additional Flow Control Functions
  3492	If your computer and software support Clear to Send and you wish to use 
  3493	Transmit Data hardware flow control (&H1), Pin 5 (DB-25) or Pin 8 (DB-9) 
  3494	is required.  
  3495	
  3496	If your computer and software support Request to Send and you wish 
  3497	to use Received Data hardware flow control (&R2), Pin 4 (DB-25) or 
  3498	Pin 7 (DB-9) is required.
  3499	
  3500	***********************************
  3501	For 38.4K or Higher Serial Port Rate 
  3502	Your terminal or computer and software must support the 115.2K, 57.6K, or 
  3503	38.4K bps rate.  Make sure the RS-232 cable is shielded.  Cables are 
  3504	normally six feet long, but longer lengths are possible.  If you 
  3505	encounter problems with signal degradation, try a shorter cable.
  3506	
  3507	If you decide to build your own cable, use a low-capacitance cable.  
  3508	To further minimize the capacitance, connect only those functions 
  3509	(pins) that your application requires.

  3584	******************
  3585	DIP SWITCH SUMMARY 
  3586	
  3587	
  3588	The DIP switches, located at the rear of the modem, are for adapting the 
  3589	modem to your equipment and personal requirements.  If necessary, review 
  3590	your software documentation.
  3591	Some users are able to move a single switch with a finger tip.  If this 
  3592	doesn't work for you, use a toothpick or other small instrument.  Do not 
  3593	use a lead pencil.
  3594	
  3595	OPERATIONS
  3596	The DIP switch settings are power-on defaults, read by the Courier when 
  3597	it is turned on.  If changed when the modem is on, switches 1-7, and 9 
  3598	require the ATZ (software reset) command to initiate the new settings.  
  3599	If you've set switch 8 OFF to disable command recognition, and want to 
  3600	return the modem to Smart mode so that it responds to commands, just 
  3601	reset switch 8 to ON.
  3602	
  3603	When you issue the ATZ command, the modem reads its DIP switch settings 
  3604	and resets either to its defaults (DIP switch 10 OFF) or factory settings 
  3605	(DIP switch 10 ON).
  3606

  3654	
  3655	****************
  3656	DEFAULT SETTINGS
  3657	
  3658	USER-PROGRAMMABLE DEFAULTS
  3659	You can create your own default configuration and store it in nonvolatile 
  3660	random access memory (NVRAM) using the &W command described in Chapter 4.  
  3661	As long as DIP switch 10 is OFF when you power on the modem, your defaults 
  3662	are loaded into the modem's random access memory (RAM).  To view your NVRAM 
  3663	settings at any time, use the ATI5 command.
  3664	
  3665	Tables on the next several pages list the options you can store in NVRAM, 
  3666	including S-Register settings.  If DIP switch 10 is ON at power-on, the 
  3667	factory template 0 settings are loaded instead.  The modem has four factory 
  3668	setting templates (&F0-F3).  By default, the first time the modem is turned 
  3669	on, the modem loads the settings stored in NVRAM, which are the same as 
  3670	the settings in factory template 1 (&F1).
  3671	
  3672	The following command example substitutes several user-defined defaults 
  3673	for factory settings.  The modem also stores the rate, word length and 
  3674	parity it detects from the AT command prefix.
  3675	
  3676		 AT X1 &B0 &M5 &H0 M3 &W <Enter>
  3677	
  3678	The modem is shipped with DIP switch 10 OFF, so when it is powered on it 
  3679	loads the settings from NVRAM.  Until these settings are changed, they are 
  3680	the same as the settings permanently stored in factory settings template 1 
  3681	(&F1).  You can alter any of these settings, create your own power-on 
  3682	defaults, and then save them with the &W command.  See Chapter 4.

  3902	******************
  3903	S-REGISTER SUMMARY
  3904	
  3905	USAGE 
  3906	The default values are those users typically require.  Change the settings 
  3907	of an S-Register with the ATSr=n command, where r is the register and n 
  3908	is a decimal value from 0-255:
  3909	
  3910		     ATS13=8 <Enter>
  3911	
  3912	The modem does not perform a value-range check.  Some values you select may 
  3913	not work with some equipment, and you'll have to readjust the settings.  
  3914	
  3915	Some registers (S13, S14, S15, S16, S27, S34) are bit-mapped (bits 0-7).  
  3916	For example, turning on bit 0 of S13 causes the modem to reset each time 
  3917	the computer or terminal drops its Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal.  
  3918	Turning on bit 3 of S13 causes the modem, on receipt of DTR, to auto 
  3919	dial the number stored at position 0 in NVRAM.
  3920	
  3921	To turn on one or more bits in any bit-mapped register, use the total of 
  3922	the values shown below.  For example, S13=9 turns on bits 0 (value of 1) 
  3923	and 3 (value of 8).
  3924	
  3925	Alternatively, identify the bits to be turned on with the following format:  
  3926	Sr.b=1, where r is the register and .b is the bit.  This format does not 
  3927	require knowledge of the bit's value.  S13.0=1 .3=1 is the equivalent of 
  3928	S13=9, above.  To turn off a bit function, set it to zero:  S13.0=0.
  3929	
  3930	To display the contents of a register, use ATSr? as in this example: 
  3931	
  3932		     ATS19? <Enter>
  3933	
  3934	       
  3935	Register    Default     Function                                
  3936	S0          See DIP     Sets the number of rings on which to
  3937		    Switch 5    answer when in Auto Answer mode.  S0=0 disables 
  3938				Auto Answer, the same as DIP switch 5 ON (factory 
  3939				setting).  S0=1 enables Auto Answer and the modem 
  3940				answers on the first ring. 
  3941	
  3942				NOTE:  If DIP switch 5 is OFF and S0=0, 
  3943				Auto Answer remains disabled.
  3944	
  3945	S1           0          Counts and stores the number of rings from an 
  3946				incoming call. 
  3947	
  3948	S2           43         Stores the ASCII decimal code for the escape code 
  3949				character.  Default character is “+”.  A value of 
  3950				128-255 disables the escape code.
  3951	
  3952	S3           13         Stores the ASCII decimal code for the Carriage 
  3953				Return character. Valid range is 0-127.
  3954	
  3955	S4           10         Stores the ASCII decimal code for the Line Feed 
  3956				character.  Valid range is 0-127.
  3957	
  3958	S5           8          Stores the ASCII decimal code for the Backspace 
  3959				character.  A value of 128-255 disables the 
  3960				Backspace key's delete function.
  3961	
  3962	S6           2          Sets the number of seconds the modem waits 
  3963				before dialing.  If set to X2, X4, X6, or X7, 
  3964				the modem dials as soon as it detects a dial 
  3965				tone (fast dials).  If there is no dial tone, 
  3966				the modem observes the normal S6 timeout.
  3967	
  3968	S7           60         Sets the number of seconds the modem waits for 
  3969				a carrier.  May be set for much longer duration if, 
  3970				for example, the modem is originating an 
  3971				international connection. 
  3972	
  3973	S8           2          Sets the duration, in seconds, for the pause (,) 
  3974				option in the Dial command and the pause between

  4359	Appendix C--Alphabetical Command Summary
  4360	
  4361	
  4362	Additional command summaries are in Chapter 4, on the bottom panel of the 
  4363	modem, and in the Quick-Reference Card.
  4364	
  4365	*****************
  4366	COMMAND SET USAGE
  4367	
  4368	Follow these guidelines:
  4369	1. Your software must be loaded and if you are using a computer, it must be 
  4370	   in Terminal mode.  
  4371	
  4372	   Some communications programs put the computer in terminal mode 
  4373	   automatically when they are loaded.  Others require you to display a 
  4374	   communications terminal screen, press a Function key, or perform some 
  4375	   other operation.  Refer to your communications software documentation 
  4376	   for instructions.
  4377	
  4378	   In Terminal mode the computer acts as if it were a standard terminal 
  4379	   such as a teletypewriter, rather than a data processor.  Keyboard 
  4380	   entries go directly to the modem, whether the entry is a modem command 
  4381	   or data to be transmitted over the phone lines.  Received data is 
  4382	   output directly to the screen. 
  4383	
  4384	2. Type commands in either upper or lower case, not a combination (AT or 
  4385	   at--not At).
  4386	
  4387	3. All commands except A/, A> and +++ are preceded by the AT (attention) 
  4388	   prefix and are executed with the Enter/Carriage Return key (<Enter>).
  4389	
  4390	4. Command length = 60 characters maximum.  The modem doesn't count the 
  4391	   AT prefix, Carriage Return character, or spaces.  It counts (but 
  4392	   doesn't act on) punctuation such as hyphens and parentheses.
  4393	
  4394	5. A missing numeric parameter is assumed to be zero, as in the command 
  4395	   to hang up:  ATH <Enter> is the equivalent of ATH0 <Enter>.
  4396	
  4397	   Example (spaces are not required, but are added here for readability):
  4398	
  4399		    AT &K3 X2 DT 071 312 1234 <Enter>
  4400	
  4401	   AT      Attention; a command follows.
  4402	   &K3     Disable MNP5 data compression; use only V.42 bis compression.
  4403	   X2      Use the X2 result code subset.
  4404	   DT      Dial the following number using tone dialing.
  4405	   <Enter> Execute the commands.
  4406	
  4407	   NOTE:  The defaults listed are based on the modem's shipping 
  4408	   configuration:  load from nonvolatile random access memory (NVRAM), 
  4409	   DIP switch 10 OFF, which is the same as the &F1 configuration template.  
  4410	   For a complete listing of default configuration templates, see Appendix B.
  4411	
  4412	*****************
  4413	Basic Command Set
  4414	
  4415	+++     Escape code operations.  Once the modem is online to another system, 
  4416		the only command it recognizes is an escape code of three typed 
  4417		pluses, which forces the modem back to Command mode.  Do the 
  4418		following when issuing the command:  
  4419	
  4420		*  Wait one second after sending the last item of data
  4421		*  Type: +++
  4422		*  Wait one second before typing any data
  4423	
  4424		Do not type the AT prefix or a Carriage Return.  The guard time of 
  4425		one second before and after the code prevents the modem from 
  4426		misinterpreting the occurrence of +++ in the transmitted data 
  4427		stream.  
  4428	
  4429		If necessary, the character used in the escape code or the 
  4430		duration of the guard time can be changed by resetting Register 
  4431		S2 or S12.  See the S-Register Summary in Appendix B.
  4432	
  4433		In response to +++ the modem returns to Command mode.  However, it 
  4434		keeps the line open or hangs up, depending on the setting of DIP 
  4435		switch 9: 
  4436	
  4437		DIP Switch 9    Response to +++
  4438		OFF             Modem goes on hook (hangs up), sends NO CARRIER 
  4439				result code (factory setting)
  4440		ON              Modem maintains connection (Online-Command mode), 
  4441				sends OK result code 
  4442	
  4443		The factory setting (OFF) forces an automatic disconnect when you 
  4444		issue +++.   An advantage of this is that you are not likely to 
  4445		inadvertently run up an all-night phone bill.  
  4446	
  4447		Set DIP switch 9 ON if you want the modem to respond to +++ by 
  4448		entering Online-Command mode, enabling it to execute commands and 
  4449		return online.  (See the O command later in this appendix.)  
  4450	
  4451	>       If you know the modem you are calling is frequently busy, include 
  4452		the Repeat command in the Dial string, as follows:
  4453	
  4454		       AT > DT 1234567 <Enter>  
  4455				or
  4456		       AT DT 1234567 > <Enter>
  4457	
  4458		The modem enters Repeat mode, dials the number, waits 60 seconds 
  4459		for a carrier (default), and hangs up.  Then after a two-second 
  4460		pause, it redials.  
  4461	
  4462		The cycle continues until the modems connect or the modem reaches 
  4463		a maximum of 10 attempts.
  4464	
  4465	A       Force Answer mode when the modem hasn't received an incoming call.
  4466	
  4467	A/      Re-execute the last issued command.  A/ doesn't take the AT prefix 
  4468		or a Carriage Return, and can be used to redial.
  4469	
  4470	A>      This command combines the features of both the A/ and > commands.  
  4471		The modem enters Repeat mode and redials the Dial string in the 
  4472		command buffer.  Like the A/ command, A> does not take the AT 
  4473		prefix or a Carriage Return.
  4474	
  4475	AT      Attention command prefix.  Use AT alone to test for the OK result 
  4476		code.  AT must prefix all commands except A/, A> and +++.
  4477	
  4478	Any     Terminate the current dialing operation resulting from an
  4479	key     issued Dial command; terminate Repeat mode (> or A>).
  4480	
  4481	Bn      Handshake options for international calls above 1200 bps.
  4482		B0  ITU-T (formerly CCITT) answer sequence.  Default.  This is 
  4483		    required to answer all V.32-type calls as well as calls from 
  4484		    overseas.
  4485		B1  Bell answer tone.  This setting selects HST modulation in 
  4486		    Dual Standard modems; but should only be used if the modem is 
  4487		    not required to answer V.32-type calls.  
  4488	    
  4489		    NOTE:  This setting is required for HST cellular calls.
  4490	
  4491	Cn      Transmitter enabled/disabled.
  4492		C0  Transmitter disabled; receive-only condition.
  4493		C1  Transmitter enabled (Default).
  4494	
  4495	Dn      Dial the specified phone number; also execute Dial options.
  4496	
  4497		The maximum number of characters allowed is 36, including the AT 
  4498		prefix, punctuation and spaces.  The Carriage Return (Enter key) 
  4499		isn't counted as a character.
  4500	
  4501		NOTE:  With the exception of the Dial options, the modem ignores 
  4502		any commands issued after D in the same command string.  
  4503	
  4504	D       Dial the number that follows and enter Originate mode.  Optional 
  4505		parameters:
  4506		P     Pulse dial (Default).
  4507		T     Tone dial.
  4508		,     (Comma) Pause for 2 seconds before continuing to dial.
  4509		;     Return to Command mode after dialing.  
  4510		"     Dial the letters that follow (in an alphabetical phone number).  
  4511		!     Transfer a call (flash the switch-hook).  This command applies 
  4512		      to modems in installations where other modems share the phone 
  4513		      line.  The modem flashes the switch-hook (goes off hook 0.5 
  4514		      seconds, on hook for 0.5 seconds and off hook again) to dial 
  4515		      the specified extension.
  4516		W     This command is useful in situations where you must wait for a 
  4517		      second dial tone before continuing dialing.
  4518		@     Wait for an answer (with X3 or higher).  The @ command can be 
  4519		      used in the Dial string to tell the modem to detect at least 
  4520		      one ring, wait for five seconds of silence at the other end of 
  4521		      the call, and then continue to execute the Dial string.
  4522		/     A slash (/) causes a pause of only 125 milliseconds.
  4523		R     Reverse frequencies.  This command allows calls to an 
  4524		      originate-only modem.  It reverses the modem's originate/answer 
  4525		      frequencies, forcing the Courier to dial out at the answer 
  4526		      frequency.
  4527	
  4528	DL      Dial the last-dialed number.  The modem stores each Dial command 
  4529		until it receives the next Dial command.  Use DL instead of A/, 
  4530		described on the next page, if you wish to send the modem non-Dial 
  4531		commands before dialing again.
  4532	
  4533	DSn     Dial the number stored in nonvolatile random access memory at 
  4534		position n, where n = 0-9. 
  4535	
  4536	En      Command mode local echo.  Enables/disables the display of your 
  4537		typed commands.  If double characters appear on the screen, both the 
  4538		modem's local echo and your software's local echo are on.  
  4539	
  4540		The Courier is shipped with DIP switch 4 OFF, enabling local echo.  
  4541		The En command controls the local echo for a current session, 
  4542		independently of the switch setting. 
  4543	
  4544		E0  Command mode echo OFF.  The modem does not display keyboard 
  4545		    commands.
  4546		E1  Command mode echo ON.
  4547	
  4548	Fn      Online local echo.  This command causes the modem to display a copy 
  4549		of the data it is transmitting to another system.
  4550		F0  Online echo ON.  Sometimes called half duplex.  As the modem 
  4551		    transmits data to a remote system, it also sends a copy of the 
  4552		    data to the screen.
  4553		F1  Online echo OFF.  Sometimes called full duplex.  Default.
  4554	
  4555	Hn      On/off hook control.
  4556		H0  Hang up (go on hook).
  4557		H1  Go off hook.
  4558	
  4559	In      Inquiry
  4560		I0  Display product code
  4561		I1  Display results from ROM checksum
  4562		I2  Display results from RAM test
  4563		I3  Display the duration of the last call
  4564		I4  Display current modem settings
  4565		I5  Display NVRAM settings
  4566		I6  Display Dial diagnostics summary of the last call
  4567		I7  Display product configuration information
  4568		I8  Reserved
  4569		I9  Reserved
  4570		I10 Display dial security account status information
  4571		I11 Display a high speed connection report
  4572	
  4573	Kn      Modem clock operation:  Call-duration or Real-time mode.  Displayed 
  4574		with ATI3 and ATI6 commands.
  4575		K0  Display current call-duration if online.  Display last 
  4576		    call-duration if offline.  Default.
  4577		K1  Return actual time at ATI3.  Clock is set using ATI3=HH:MM:SS K1.
  4578	
  4579	Ln      Speaker volume control (internal modems only)
  4580		L0  Low
  4581		L1  Low
  4582		L2  Medium (default)
  4583		L3  High
  4584	
  4585		NOTE:  External modems will return an OK message to this command, 
  4586		but the volume will not change.  The volume button must be used to 
  4587		alter volume.
  4588	
  4589	Mn      Speaker (audio monitor).
  4590		M0  The speaker is always OFF.
  4591		M1  The speaker is ON until carrier is established (Default).
  4592		M2  The speaker is always ON, including during data transfer.
  4593		M3  The speaker is ON after the last digit is dialed and remains 
  4594		    ON until carrier is established.
  4595	
  4596	On      If DIP switch 9 is ON (on detection of the escape code the modem 
  4597		maintains the connection), you can issue commands and then toggle 
  4598		the modem back online with the On command.
  4599	
  4600		There are two ways to return online.
  4601	
  4602		ATO0 Return online (normal).  
  4603		ATO1 Return online and retrain.  Use to have the modem 
  4604		re-synchronize if there were errors in a non-ARQ data transfer.
  4605	
  4606	Qn      Enable/suppress the display of result codes.  The Courier is 
  4607		shipped with DIP switch 3 ON, to display result codes.  Use the Qn 
  4608		command to control the display for a current session, independently 
  4609		of the switch setting. 
  4610	
  4611		Q0  Result codes displayed.
  4612		Q1  Result codes suppressed (quiet).
  4613		Q2  Result codes suppressed in Answer mode.
  4614	
  4615	Sr=n    Set S-Register value:  r is any S-Register; n must be a decimal 
  4616		number between 0 and 255.
  4617	
  4618	Sr.b=n  Alternative command for setting bit-mapped registers:  r is the 
  4619		bit-mapped register; .b is the bit; n is 0 (off) or 1 (on).
  4620	
  4621	Sr?     Query contents of register r.
  4622	
  4623	Vn      Return result codes in words or numbers (Verbal/Numeric mode).  
  4624		V0  Numeric mode.
  4625		V1  Verbal mode.
  4626	
  4627	Xn      Result code set options.  Use the following table (Default = X7, 
  4628		all codes except 12/VOICE).  For result codes in synchronous 
  4629		operations, see Appendix F.

  4688		    only.  When the modem goes off hook and connects in ARQ mode, 
  4689		    it shifts its serial port rate up to a user-specified rate, 
  4690		    for example, 38.4K bps.  If the connection is not under error 
  4691		    control, the modem behaves as if it were set to &B0 and 
  4692		    switches its serial port rate to match the connection rate of 
  4693		    each call.
  4694	
  4695	&Cn     Carrier Detect operations.  At power-on and reset, the modem 
  4696		operates according to the setting of DIP switch 6.  This command 
  4697		is not stored in nonvolatile memory as a power-on/reset default.
  4698	
  4699		&C0 CD override, CD always ON.
  4700		&C1 Normal CD operations.  The Courier sends a CD signal when 
  4701		    it connects with another modem and drops the CD when it 
  4702		    disconnects.
  4703	
  4704	&Dn     Data Terminal Ready (DTR) operations.  At power-on and reset, the 
  4705		modem operates according to the setting of DIP switch 1.  This 
  4706		command is not stored in nonvolatile memory as a power-on/reset 
  4707		default.
  4708	
  4709		&D0 DTR override.  The modem operates as though the DTR is always ON.
  4710	
  4711		&D1 Advance usage:  If issued before connecting with another modem, 
  4712		    the modem can enter online command mode during a call by 
  4713		    toggling DTR.  &D1 functions similarly to the escape code 
  4714		    (+++), except that this setting is independent of DIP switch 9.
  4715	
  4716		    If DIP switch 1 is ON (DTR override) when you issue the &D1 
  4717		    command, the DTR override is automatically turned off.  
  4718		    However, if you change the setting of DIP switch 1 after 
  4719		    issuing &D1, the DIP switch setting tales precedence.
  4720	
  4721		    Return online with the On command, or hang up with the Hn 
  4722		    command.
  4723	
  4724		&D2 Normal DTR operations.  The terminal or computer must send a 
  4725		    DTR signal for the modem to accept commands.  Dropping DTR 
  4726		    terminates a call.
  4727	
  4728	&Fn     The modem is shipped with four configurations (templates), 
  4729		&F0-&F3, stored in permanent nonprogrammable memory (ROM).  
  4730		Appendix B includes configuration listings for each template.  
  4731		Any one of the templates may be loaded into current memory 
  4732		(AT &Fn) or written to nonvolatile memory and reset default 
  4733		(AT &Fn &W).  Note, however, that &F0 is always loaded into 
  4734		memory if DIP switch 10 is ON. 
  4735	
  4736		&F0 Load No Flow Control template settings
  4737		&F1 Load Hardware Flow Control template settings (Default)
  4738		&F2 Load Software Flow Control template settings
  4739		&F3 Load HST Cellular template settings
  4740	
  4741	&Gn     This setting applies only to overseas calls at 2400 or 1200 bps.  
  4742		British phone switching systems require the modem to send an 1800 
  4743		Hz guard tone after it sends an answer tone.  Some other European 
  4744		phone networks require a 550 Hz guard tone.  Guard tones are not 
  4745		used in the United States or Canada.
  4746	
  4747		&G0 No guard tone.  This is used in the U.S. and in Canada (Default).
  4748		&G1 This sets a 550 Hz guard tone, and is used in some European 
  4749		    countries.
  4750		&G2 This sets an 1800 Hz guard tone, and is used in the U.K. and 
  4751		    some Commonwealth countries.  &G2 requires the B0 setting.
  4752	
  4753	&Hn     Transmit data flow control is for data transmitted to the modem 
  4754		by its attached computer or terminal.  The modem monitors its 
  4755		buffer as data comes from the computer or modem.  If the buffer 
  4756		approaches 90% capacity, the modem signals the computer or terminal 
  4757		to stop transmitting.  When the modem has sent enough data over 
  4758		the link to half empty the buffer, it signals the computer or 
  4759		terminal to resume transmitting.
  4760	
  4761	&H0     Transmit Data flow control disabled.
  4762		&H1 Hardware flow control.  Default.  Requires that your computer 
  4763		    or terminal and software support Clear to Send (CTS) at the 
  4764		    RS-232 interface.
  4765		&H2 Software flow control.  Requires that your software support 
  4766		    XON/XOFF signaling.
  4767		&H3 Use both hardware and software flow control.  If you are unsure 
  4768		    about what your equipment supports, select this option. 
  4769	
  4770	&In     Received data software flow control.
  4771	
  4772		&I0 Disables XON/XOFF flow control of received data. Default.
  4773	
  4774		&I1 The Courier acts on your typed XON/XOFF commands, Ctrl-S or 
  4775		    Ctrl-Q, and passes them to the remote computer. 
  4776	
  4777		&I2 The Courier acts on your XON/XOFF commands, but removes them 
  4778		    from the data stream instead of passing them to the remote 
  4779		    computer.  This is the recommended setting for ARQ mode.
  4780	
  4781		&I3 Hewlett Packard--Host mode.  Applies only to modems attached to 
  4782		    an HP mainframe that uses the ENQ/ACK protocol.  Use in ARQ 
  4783		    nmode only.  See Appendix G.
  4784	
  4785		&I4 Hewlett Packard--Terminal mode.  Applies only to modems 
  4786		    attached to terminals in an HP system that uses the ENQ/ACK 
  4787		    protocol.  Use in ARQ mode only.  See Appendix G.
  4788	
  4789		&I5 This setting is designed to enable flow control on the phone 
  4790		    link when the connection is not under error control.  For this 
  4791		    to work for you, the remote modem must have &I5 capability.
  4792	
  4793	&Kn     Enable/disable data compression.
  4794		&K0 Data compression disabled.
  4795		&K1 Auto enable/disable.  Default.  The modem enables compression 
  4796		    if the serial port rate is fixed, &B1, and disables compression 
  4797		    if the serial port rate follows the connection rate, &B0, 
  4798		    because compression offers no throughput advantage when the 
  4799		    serial port and connection rates are equal.  Compression may 
  4800		    even degrade throughput. 
  4801		&K2 Data compression enabled.  Use this setting to keep the modem 
  4802		    from disabling compression. 
  4803		&K3 Selective data compression.  The modem negotiates only for 
  4804		    V.42 bis compression, and disables MNP Level 5 (MNP5) 
  4805		    compression.  Use this setting to transfer 8-bit binary 
  4806		    files, .ZIP files, and other files that are already compressed.
  4807	
  4808	&Ln     Normal/Leased phone line.
  4809		&L0 Normal phone line.  Default.
  4810		&L1 Leased line; enables modem to reconnect if disconnected.
  4811		&L2 Cellular operations; with B1, enables HST Cellular mode.
  4812	
  4813	&Mn     Enable ARQ (error control) or synchronous protocols.  Both your 
  4814		modem and the remote modem must use the same protocol.
  4815		&M0 Normal mode, no error control.  Due to the nature of phone 
  4816		    line channels, this is never recommended for calls above 2400 
  4817		    bps.  
  4818		&M1 This setting is exclusive of the modems' error control and is 
  4819		    used only for online synchronous mode without V.25 bis.  See 
  4820		    Appendix F for more information.
  4821		&M2 Reserved.
  4822		&M3 Reserved.
  4823		&M4 Normal/ARQ mode.  Default.  If an ARQ connection isn't made, 
  4824		    the modem operates in Normal mode, as though it were set to &M0.
  4825		&M5 The modem enters ARQ asynchronous mode.  The modem hangs up if 
  4826		    an ARQ connection cannot be made.  
  4827		&M6 The modem enters V.25 bis synchronous mode, using a character-
  4828		    oriented link protocol similar to BISYNC.  See Appendix F for 
  4829		    more information.
  4830		&M7 The modem enters V.25 bis synchronous mode, using the HDLC link 
  4831		    protocol.
  4832	
  4833	&Nn     Connection rate variable or fixed.
  4834		&N0  Variable rates.  Default.  The Courier negotiates with the 
  4835		     remote modem for the highest possible connection rate, 
  4836		     depending on the capabilities of the remote modem.  This is 
  4837		     the recommended setting.  
  4838		&N1- Fixed rate.  The modem only connects if the remote modem is
  4839		&N14 operating at the same rate.  If not, the modem hangs up.  If 
  4840		     you wish, you can filter out calls at other than a specific 
  4841		     rate, for security or other reasons, by fixing the connection 
  4842		     rate.
  4843	
  4844		     The connection rate must always be lower than, or equal to, 
  4845		     the serial port rate, never higher.  
  4846	       
  4847		The options are as follows.
  4848		&N1   300 bps         &N9   16.8K bps (HST, terbo,
  4849		&N2   1200 bps                 V.FC, and V.34 only)
  4850		&N3   2400 bps        &N10  19.2K bps (terbo, V.FC, 
  4851		&N4   4800 bps                 and V.34 only)
  4852		&N5   7200 bps        &N11  21.6K bps (terbo, V.FC,
  4853		&N6   9600 bps                 and V.34 only)
  4854		&N7   12K bps         &N12  24K bps (V.FC and V.34 only)
  4855		&N8   14.4K bps       &N13  26.4K bps (V.FC and V.34 only)
  4856				      &N14  28.8K bps (V.FC and V.34 only)
  4857	
  4858	&Pn     This command sets the ratio of the off-hook/on-hook (make/break) 
  4859		interval for pulse dialing.  The default sets the modem for use 
  4860		in North America.  The ratio must be changed if the modem is used 
  4861		in the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth countries.
  4862		&P0 Make/break ratio, U.S./Canada:  39%/61%.  Default.  
  4863		&P1 Make/break ratio, United Kingdom, some Commonwealth 
  4864		    countries:  33%/67%.
  4865	
  4866	&Rn     Received data hardware (RTS) flow control
  4867		&R0 Delay Clear to Send Response after Request to Send signal 
  4868		    (RTS/CTS delay).  
  4869		&R1 The modem ignores RTS.  This setting is required if your 
  4870		    computer or terminal or software does not support RTS.
  4871		&R2 Hardware flow control of received data enabled.  Default.  
  4872		    The modem sends data to the computer or terminal only on 
  4873		    receipt of the RTS signal.
  4874	
  4875	&Sn     The modem sends the computer or terminal a Data Set Ready (DSR) 
  4876		signal via the RS-232 interface.  (Data Set is industry jargon for 
  4877		modem.)  
  4878		&S0 DSR is always ON (override).  Default.
  4879		&S1 In Originate mode, the modem sends the DSR after it dials, 
  4880		    when it detects the remote modem's answer tone.  In Answer 
  4881		    mode, the modem sends the DSR after it sends an answer tone.
  4882		&S2 This option is for specialized equipment such as automatic 
  4883		    callback units.  On loss of carrier, the modem sends a pulsed 
  4884		    DSR signal with Clear to Send (CTS) following Carrier Detect (CD).
  4885		&S3 This is the same as &S2, but without the CTS following CD.
  4886		&S4 The modem sends the computer a DSR signal at the same time as 
  4887		    it sends the Carrier Detect (CD).
  4888		&S5 CTS follows Carrier Detect with DSR normal

  4900	
  4901	&W      Write the curent settings to NVRAM.
  4902	
  4903	&Xn     Synchronous transmit clock timing signals setting.  Determines 
  4904		whether the modem or DTE will generate the timing signals.
  4905	
  4906		&X0 The Courier is the source of the Transmit clock timing 
  4907		    signals and sends them to your DTE over the RS-232 interface.  
  4908		    The DTE rate will follow the connection rates.  Default.
  4909	
  4910		&X1 The DTE is the source of the Transmit clock timing signals 
  4911		    and sends them to the Courier over the RS-232 interface.  This 
  4912		    setting is used typically in leased line multiplexed operations.
  4913		    (Multiplexors divide the phone channel so that the channel 
  4914		    carries several calls at the same time.)  
  4915	    
  4916		    The DTE ignores the Courier's clock timing signals and 
  4917		    negotiates the DTE and connection rates.
  4918	
  4919		&X2 The Courier's Receiver clock is the source of the timing 
  4920		    signals.  The signals are looped to the Transmit clock and 
  4921		    sent to your DTE over the RS-232 interface.  This setting is 
  4922		    only used in those systems that require synchronization of 
  4923		    data flowing in both directions.
  4924	
  4925	&Yn     Break handling.  This command allows you to send a break to abort 
  4926		data transfer without disconnecting from the phone link.
  4927		&Y0 Destructive, don't send Break.
  4928		&Y1 Destructive, expedited (Default).
  4929		&Y2 Nondestructive, expedited.
  4930		&Y3 Nondestructive, unexpedited; modem sends Break in sequence 
  4931		    with data received from computer or terminal.
  4932	
  4933	&ZC?    Display the stored command string.
  4934	
  4935	&ZC=s   Write the following command string s to NVRAM.  The command string 
  4936		may be up to 40 characters long; spaces are not counted.  This 
  4937		command can be used so that you can call another modem without 
  4938		loading your communications software.
  4939	
  4940		After storing a command, you can program the voice/data switch 
  4941		to execute the stored command string when pressed.  The following 
  4942		example assigns a command string that displays the link diagnostics 
  4943		screen when you press the voice/data switch.  
  4944	
  4945		       AT&ZC=I6 <Enter>
  4946	
  4947		The function of the voice/data switch is determined by the setting 
  4948		of Register S32, as described in Appendix G.  Set the voice/data 
  4949		switch function to execute stored command string by setting 
  4950		Register S32 to 9 with the following command:
  4951	
  4952		      ATS32=9 <Enter>
  4953	
  4954		Note that you can reset the voice/data switch at any time to one of 
  4955		the other available functions.  Additionally, you can overwrite the 
  4956		stored command string with a new one at any time.
  4957	
  4958		Once you've stored your command string and set Register S32, all 
  4959		you need to do is press the voice/data switch whenever you want 
  4960		the command string executed.
  4961	
  4962	&Zn=s   This command stores up to ten numbers, where n is the position 
  4963		0-9 in nonvolatile memory, and s is the phone number string.  
  4964		The number-string may be up to 36 characters long, including 
  4965		any Dial command options.  
  4966	
  4967		      AT &Z2=555-6789 <Enter>
  4968	
  4969		Do not include modem settings in the &Zn string.  If the call 
  4970		requires a special setting, insert it in the command string 
  4971		before the DSn command.  In the following example, &M0 (no 
  4972		error control) is inserted before the Dial command:
  4973	
  4974		      AT&M0 DS2 <Enter>
  4975	
  4976		NOTE:  The &Zn=s command functions differently when Dial Security 
  4977		is enabled.  See Appendix D for more information.
  4978	
  4979	&Zn?    Display the phone number stored in NVRAM at position n (n = 0-9).

  5057	%T      Enables the modem, when off hook, to detect the tone frequencies 
  5058		of dialing modems.  %T is meant primarily for use with network 
  5059		applications, but may also be integrated into certain software 
  5060		programs.  For example, %T could be used in a security program 
  5061		to identify incoming tone security codes.
  5062		
  5063		To enable %T, type ATH1 <Enter> to force the modem off hook.  
  5064		Then type AT%T <Enter>.  
  5065	
  5066		To return the modem to Command mode, press any key or drop the 
  5067		computer's or terminal's DTR signal.  The modem responds OK.

  5075	DIAL SECURITY OPERATIONS              
  5076	
  5077	Dial Security is designed to protect networks and data centers from 
  5078	unauthorized access.  The kind of security provided by the Courier modem 
  5079	is different from other kinds of dial security where software is used by 
  5080	the computer to control user access.  The Courier’s Dial Security is set 
  5081	up in the modem’s firmware, so access is controlled from modem to modem.
  5082	
  5083	Setting up this kind of security requires action at both the host and 
  5084	remote modem sites.  This appendix contains instructions for both 
  5085	operations.
  5086	
  5087	WARNINGS:  
  5088	
  5089	If you want to set up Security on your Courier modem, you must complete 
  5090	the steps below in the order listed:
  5091	
  5092	1. Set up your own security account: 
  5093	   *  Set up your local access password
  5094	   *  Enable local access password protection
  5095	
  5096	2. Set up remote user accounts.
  5097	
  5098	3. Enable Dial Security.
  5099	
  5100	You must set up your local access security information before enabling 
  5101	Dial Security and allowing remote calls, as outlined under Set Up Your 
  5102	Security Account in what follows.  
  5103	
  5104	Be sure to remember your local access password; if you enable security 
  5105	and forget your local access password, you risk being locked out of 
  5106	your system.
  5107	
  5108	********
  5109	Overview
  5110	The Courier’s Dial Security allows you to configure up to 10 Security 
  5111	accounts.  Each security account is stored in nonvolatile memory (NVRAM) 
  5112	and may be set up in one of three ways:
  5113	
  5114	* Automatic password access
  5115	* Prompted password access
  5116	* Password with Dialback protection
  5117	
  5118	
  5119	Autopass
  5120	Autopass is the term we use for the basic implementation of Dial Security 
  5121	in the Courier modem.  It is in effect whenever Dial Security is enabled.
  5122	
  5123	To use autopass alone, the following requirements must be met:
  5124	* Both host and remote modems must be U.S. Robotics modems with 
  5125	  Dial Security enabled.
  5126	* The connection must be under V.42 error control (both modems must be 
  5127	  set to &M4 or &M5).
  5128	
  5129	When the remote modem is set for Dial Security, it automatically 
  5130	includes an autopass password (configured by the remote user to be 
  5131	compatible with the host modem’s security) in its V.42 error control 
  5132	request.  The host modem checks all the enabled passwords in its 
  5133	security accounts for a match.
  5134	
  5135	If the remote user has set up the modem with an invalid password, the host 
  5136	modem returns an INVALID PASSWORD message and hangs up.
  5137	
  5138	If the remote user failed to enable Dial Security on the remote Courier, 
  5139	the host Courier will not accept the call unless prompting (below) is 
  5140	enabled on the host modem.
  5141	
  5142	
  5143	Prompting
  5144	While the use of autopass (above) is restricted to U.S. Robotics Dial 
  5145	Security modems, prompting allows secured connections with any remote 
  5146	modem whose user has been assigned an allowed password.  When prompting 
  5147	is enabled, and the host modem doesn’t receive an autopass password, it 
  5148	prompts the remote user for a password.  The host modem checks the 
  5149	received password against each of its active Security accounts. If the 
  5150	password is valid, a secure connection is completed.
  5151	
  5152	If the password is invalid, the host modem prompts twice more before 
  5153	disconnecting.  
  5154	
  5155	If there are no password attempts at the remote end, the host modem 
  5156	times out after 60 seconds and disconnects.
  5157	
  5158	NOTE:  There is no prompting capability in synchronous mode.
  5159	
  5160	Prompting is more flexible than autopass because it:
  5161	* doesn't require a remote modem to have U.S. Robotics Dial Security.
  5162	* doesn't require a V.42 connection, so remote modems without V.42 
  5163	  error control capabilities can connect.
  5164	
  5165	
  5166	Optional Dialback
  5167	Dialback offers an additional layer of security.  When the host modem 
  5168	receives a valid password that matches an account and Dialback is enabled, 
  5169	the host first disconnects.  The remote user receives a NO CARRIER message.  
  5170	Then the host modem dials back the remote modem.
  5171	
  5172	Typically, the Dialback number is stored in the Security account’s phone 
  5173	number field.  However, if the security account has been set up to allow 
  5174	a new number, the host prompts the remote user for the new number before 
  5175	hanging up, and then dials back.
  5176	
  5177	In order to use dialback, Dial security and prompting must be enabled.
  5178	
  5179	
  5180	****************************************
  5181	WHAT THE HOST MODEM OPERATOR NEEDS TO DO
  5182	
  5183	Complete the steps below in the order listed:
  5184	1. Set up your own Security account.
  5185	2. Set up Security accounts for your remote users.
  5186	3. Enable Dial Security.
  5187	4. Maintain Security accounts.
  5188	
  5189	****************************
  5190	Set Up Your Security Account
  5191	Security accounts are set up via an AT command line structure, rather 
  5192	than a screen format.  
  5193	
  5194	1. Set up your Security account using one of 10 accounts (numbered 0-9).  
  5195	   Each account has five possible fields, as shown in the following table.  
  5196	
  5197	
  5198	Password        Account   Dialback        Allow New        Dialback
  5199	Enabled         Enabled   Enabled         Number           Number
  5200	8 chars. max.   YES/NO    YES/NO          YES/NO           Up to 37                                           
  5201	ASCII 37-127                                               characters 
  5202	case sensitive*                                            (0-9)
  5203	
  5204	BILL              Y         Y                N            1-419-555-5555
  5205	
  5206	*  If "BILL" is the password, "Bill" is an invalid entry.
  5207	
  5208	
  5209	Use the %An= command and format (below) to set up accounts, where n is the 
  5210	account number, 0-9.  The fields in the above table are entered after the 
  5211	equal sign, each separated by a comma, as in the following example for 
  5212	account 0 with the password BILL.
  5213	
  5214	WARNING:  Do not insert spaces between commas or between fields and commas.  
  5215	Spaces will invalidate the command.
  5216	
  5217	           AT%A0=BILL,Y,Y,N,1-419-555-5555 <Enter>
  5218	
  5219	This example instructs the modem to store the configuration for account 0:  
  5220	password (BILL), account enabled (Y), dialback enabled (Y), allow a new 
  5221	number (N), and the dialback phone number.  
  5222	
  5223	NOTE:  The %An= command is automatically written to NVRAM and does not 
  5224	require an &W.
  5225	
  5226	Some accounts may have fewer security options.  The following example sets 
  5227	the password (Judy) and enables account 1 without any dialback options.
  5228	
  5229	          AT%A1=Judy,Y,,, <Enter>
  5230	
  5231	Each security function can be configured or modified independently.  If a 
  5232	field is to remain as is, just insert a comma, as shown in the following 
  5233	command.  It allows the remote user to supply a new Dialback number 
  5234	different from the one stored in the original account record.
  5235	
  5236	         AT%A0=,,,Y, <Enter>
  5237	
  5238	2. Set up your local access password.  This password protects the Security
  5239	   accounts from unauthorized users.  When this protection is enabled, you 
  5240	   cannot view, modify, or tamper with the Security accounts unless you 
  5241	   enter the correct local access password.  The local access password must 
  5242	   be chosen and protection must be enabled before Dial Security is enabled.
  5243	
  5244	   In the following example, the local access password is the same as the 
  5245	   password in account 0.
  5246	
  5247	         AT%L=PW0 <Enter>
  5248	
  5249	********************************
  5250	Set up Accounts for Remote Users
  5251	Once your account is configured and password protection has been enabled, 
  5252	you can set up the remote user accounts.  Use the %An= command (using the 
  5253	same guidelines you used to set up the system administrator’s account in 
  5254	Step 1 of the previous section) to set up remote user accounts.
  5255	
  5256	Once security accounts have been enabled, you are responsible for 
  5257	communicating valid password information to your remote users.
  5258	
  5259	********************
  5260	Enable Dial Security
  5261	Once you have completed the previous steps, you are ready to enable Dial 
  5262	Security.
  5263	
  5264	When you enable Dial Security, you must choose either autopass or prompting 
  5265	as the security method.  You must know what types of modems remote users 
  5266	are using and set the Dial Security parameters accordingly.  Autopass is 
  5267	limited to U.S. Robotics modems with Dial Security, but prompting is not.
  5268	
  5269	1. Register S53 is the bit-mapped register used to enable Dial Security.  
  5270	   The &W command must be used to save Register S53 settings to NVRAM.  
  5271	   Otherwise, when the computer is powered off and on again, or the modem 
  5272	   is reset using ATZ, it will default to S53=0, Dial Security disabled.
  5273	
  5274	   To enable Dial Security with autopass and local access password 
  5275	   protection, but without prompting, type the following command:
  5276	
  5277	         AT S53.0=1 .2=1 &W <Enter>
  5278	
  5279	   The following command enables Dial Security with autopass, prompting, 
  5280	   and local access password protection.
  5281	
  5282	         AT S53.0=1 .1=1 .2=1 &W <Enter>
  5283	  
  5284	   NOTE:  Enabling local access password protection disables the &Zn=s 
  5285	   command that stores up to ten phone numbers.  Stored phone numbers 
  5286	   occupy the same space in NVRAM as the dialback numbers for Dial Security 
  5287	   accounts, and cannot be used when Dial Security is enabled.
  5288	
  5289	   If the local access password is not protected, the &Zn=s command 
  5290	   overwrites the corresponding Dial Security dialback number.  For 
  5291	   example, the following command overwrites the dialback number for 
  5292	   account 5:
  5293	
  5294	        AT &Z5 = 555-8976 <Enter>
  5295	
  5296	   However, if the local access password is protected, and a user tries to 
  5297	   use the &Zn=s command, an ACCESS DENIED message is displayed.
  5298	
  5299	   WARNING:  Be sure DIP switch 10 is OFF so the modem will load the 
  5300	   settings stored in NVRAM.  If someone sets DIP switch 10 ON, the low 
  5301	   performance template settings (&F0) are loaded, and Dial Security is 
  5302	   disabled.  If this should happen, reset DIP switch 10 to OFF, power 
  5303	   off the modem and power it back on, or reset the modem by typing ATZ 
  5304	   <Enter> so that the proper settings take effect. 
  5305	   
  5306	
  5307	**************************
  5308	Maintain Security Accounts
  5309	Once the local access password is set and protected, the system 
  5310	administrator is the only one who can access account information.  To 
  5311	modify or change account information, use the %S= and %E= commands 
  5312	described next.
  5313	
  5314	Account Access (%S)
  5315	Once Dial Security is enabled, you can access accounts by entering the 
  5316	local access password using the %S= command, which allows access to the 
  5317	accounts by disabling local security.
  5318	
  5319	       AT%S=(your local access password) <Enter>
  5320	
  5321	NOTE:  The modem echoes the local access password, which is case sensitive.  
  5322	The system will accept an invalid password entry, but will lock you out 
  5323	from the modem’s security commands.  For example, if the password is Bob, 
  5324	but you enter BOB, an OK is displayed.  However, if you try to type a 
  5325	security command (for example, ATI10 <Enter> to view accounts), an ACCESS 
  5326	DENIED message is displayed. 
  5327	
  5328	Account Status
  5329	Once access has been granted, you can view account information by typing 
  5330	the I10 option of the Inquiry (I) command:
  5331	
  5332	        ATI10 <Enter>
  5333	
  5334	Remote users may only use this command during a remote access session if 
  5335	local access security is disabled.
  5336	
  5337	Erasing Account Information (%E)
  5338	Use the %E=n command to make system edits.
  5339	%E=1  Erase local access password. 
  5340	%E=2  Erase autopass password.
  5341	%E=3  Erase passwords in accounts 0-9.
  5342	%E=4  Erase phone numbers in accounts 0-9.
  5343	%E=5  Disable Account, Dialback, and New Number fields in accounts 0-9.
  5344	
  5345	To edit or overwrite an individual account, or an individual account field, 
  5346	use the %An= command described in Set Up Your Security Account, earlier 
  5347	in this appendix.
  5348	
  5349	Remote Configuration
  5350	Dial Security accounts may be configured remotely.  See Configuring Dial 
  5351	Security Remotely at the end of this appendix.
  5352	
  5353	
  5354	**********************************
  5355	WHAT THE REMOTE CALLER NEEDS TO DO
  5356	
  5357	When remote users want to call in to your Courier (assuming you have 
  5358	enabled Dial Security), they must contact you to obtain a valid password.  
  5359	They must also find out if they must set the remote modem for auto answer 
  5360	(necessary if your modem uses Dialback as a security method).
  5361	
  5362	1. If the host modem security is set up, get a password from the host 
  5363	   modem operator.  Passwords are case-sensitive, so be sure to copy it 
  5364	   down correctly.  
  5365	
  5366	   If the host modem security is set up for prompting and the host 
  5367	   operator enables dialback for your account, skip to Step 3.
  5368	
  5369	2. For remote users with COURIER modems only.  Set up security on your 
  5370	   modem, including an account that uses the password the host asked you 
  5371	   to use.  Refer to Set up Your Security Account, earlier in this 
  5372	   appendix, for instructions.  
  5373	   
  5374	   Then assign the password as your autopass password.  Enter the following 
  5375	   command, where n is the number of the account you set up):
  5376	
  5377	           AT %V=PWn <Enter>
  5378	
  5379	   You can check to see that you've correctly set up your autopass 
  5380	   password by typing the following command:
  5381	
  5382	           AT I10 <Enter>
  5383	
  5384	   Your autopass password appears in the right-hand column below FORCED 
  5385	   AUTOPASS.
  5386	
  5387	   Once the autopass password is set, enable your Courier modem’s Dial 
  5388	   Security with the following command:
  5389	
  5390	          ATS53.0=1 &W <Enter>
  5391	
  5392	3. If Dialback is enabled at the host Courier site, set your modem to 
  5393	   answer the host modem when it disconnects and dials back.
  5394	
  5395	   To set the modem to answer the Dialback call, set DIP switch 5 OFF 
  5396	   and reset the modem (ATZ <Enter>).
  5397	
  5398	   Alternatively, type the following command:
  5399	 
  5400	          AT S0=1 <Enter>
  5401	
  5402	4. Call the host modem.
  5403	
  5404	5. When the call is completed, if you want to disable auto answer, do one 
  5405	   of the following:
  5406	
  5407	   * Set DIP switch 5 ON and reset the modem (ATZ<Enter>).
  5408	   * Type the following command:
  5409	
  5410	         AT S0=0 <Enter>
  5411	
  5412	
  5413	
  5414	___________________________________________________________________________
  5415	REMOTE ACCESS OPERATIONS
  5416	
  5417	You can set a Courier modem so that someone at a remote location can 
  5418	configure your modem.  
  5419	
  5420	This might be helpful if you have problems making a connection with 
  5421	another modem.  For example, if you have trouble connecting with a 
  5422	bulletin board, you can allow the bulletin board operator to dial 
  5423	in to your modem and view its configuration settings.  If necessary, 
  5424	the bulletin board operator can send the Courier a configuration string 
  5425	that will make it compatible with the bulletin board.  
  5426	
  5427	Another use might be for Dial Security administration when the system 
  5428	administrator is unable to be at the host modem site.  It might be urgent, 
  5429	for example, to disable an account.
  5430	
  5431	*************************
  5432	AT THE HOST COUTRIER SITE
  5433	
  5434	There are two tasks required to set up remote access:
  5435	1. Set up password security.
  5436	2. Enable remote access.
  5437	
  5438	************************
  5439	Set Up Password Security
  5440	You can designate two passwords for remote access security, each allowing 
  5441	a different level of access to the remote user.  You can assign one 
  5442	password that allows viewing privileges only, whereby the host Courier's 
  5443	configuration can be remotely viewed but not changed.  You can assign 
  5444	another password that allows both remote viewing and configuration 
  5445	privileges.
  5446	
  5447	Remote access passwords can be up to eight alphanumeric characters 
  5448	long, and are not case-sensitive.
  5449	
  5450	%Pn   Use the %Pn command to assign remote privileges.
  5451	      %P0  Viewing privileges only
  5452	      %P1  Viewing and configuration privileges
  5453	
  5454	To assign a password that allows viewing privileges only, use the command 
  5455	format below:  
  5456	
  5457	        AT%P0=[password] <Enter>
  5458	
  5459	To assign a password that allows viewing and configuration privileges, 
  5460	use the command format below:  
  5461	
  5462	        AT%P1=[password] <Enter>
  5463	
  5464	
  5465	Disabling Password Security
  5466	If you want to disable an assigned password (and thereby disable remote 
  5467	access security), use the following command format:
  5468	
  5469	          AT%P0= <Enter>
  5470	                or
  5471	          AT%P1= <Enter>
  5472	
  5473	WARNING:  If you disable the %P1 password, a remote user does not need 
  5474	to enter a password for configuration access.
  5475	
  5476	********************
  5477	Enable Remote Access
  5478	Set Register S41 for a value of 1 or greater.  S41 is used to set the 
  5479	number of allowable login attempts, as explained later.  A setting of 
  5480	zero allows no login attempts, and thus disables remote access.
  5481	
  5482	          AT S41=1 <Enter>
  5483	
  5484	NOTE:  This method will not work if your modem is attached to certain 
  5485	synchronous devices.  Refer to Appendix F for more information.
  5486	
  5487	LED Indicator for Remote Access
  5488	The Courier's SYN status light indicator (LED) flashes to indicate when 
  5489	it is in a remote access session.
  5490	
  5491	
  5492	************************
  5493	AT THE REMOTE MODEM SITE
  5494	
  5495	Remote configuration can be performed at any time during an asynchronous 
  5496	connection.  The user performing remote configuration can use any modem; 
  5497	it does not have to be a U.S. Robotics model.
  5498	
  5499	1. Make sure the host Courier has been set for remote configuration, as
  5500	   described earlier.  Then establish a connection.  It does not matter 
  5501	   which modem originates the call.
  5502	2. After a connection has been established, send the following escape 
  5503	   sequence:
  5504	
  5505	        Pause four seconds,
  5506	        type four tildes: ~~~~
  5507	        and 
  5508	        pause another four seconds.
  5509	
  5510	   NOTE:  You can change the escape sequence character with Register S42.  
  5511	   The pause duration (guard time) can be modified with Register S43.  
  5512	   (These values are set at the host Courier modem.)
  5513	
  5514	3. When the Courier begins its login sequence, the caller will see a 
  5515	   display similar to the following:
  5516	
  5517	      U.S Robotics Courier HST Dual Standard V.34 Fax Remote Session
  5518	                   Serial Number 000000A000000001
  5519	
  5520	4. At this point, if password security is active, the caller is prompted 
  5521	   for the password.  
  5522	   
  5523	      Password (Ctrl-C to cancel)?.....
  5524	
  5525	   As described earlier in Password Security, entering the password 
  5526	   assigned by the %P0 command allows viewing privileges only.  Entering 
  5527	   the password assigned by the %P1 command allows viewing and configuration 
  5528	   privileges.  Note that there is a 3-minute time limit for entering the 
  5529	   password.
  5530	
  5531	   As mentioned earlier, if the number of unsuccessful login attempts 
  5532	   exceeds the set limit, the modem returns online and refuses any further 
  5533	   login attempts during the remainder of that connection.  
  5534	   
  5535	   When a password is accepted, the Courier indicates that it has entered 
  5536	   Remote Access mode and the remote prompt appears on the remote caller's 
  5537	   screen.  
  5538	   
  5539	     Access Granted
  5540	     Remote->
  5541	
  5542	5. If password security is not active (no passwords have been set or both 
  5543	   passwords are disabled), the Courier automatically enters Remote 
  5544	   Access mode and the remote prompt appears on the remote caller's 
  5545	   screen.
  5546	
  5547	     Remote->
  5548	
  5549	6. Once the remote access session has been established, keep in mind that
  5550	   there is a 3 minute inactivity timer.  If the modem detects no activity 
  5551	   for 3 minutes, it aborts the remote access session and resumes a normal 
  5552	   online connection.
  5553	
  5554	Aborting the Request for Remote Access 
  5555	If you want to abort the remote access login before you have entered the 
  5556	password, return online by pressing <Ctrl>-C or typing ATO <Enter>.
  5557	
  5558	********************************
  5559	Remote Viewing and Configuration
  5560	Once you've gained remote access, you can communicate with the host Courier 
  5561	as if you are entering commands at its attached computer.  Depending on your 
  5562	access privileges, you can use the regular Courier AT commands.
  5563	
  5564	If you have view privileges only (with %P0), you can use any of the view 
  5565	(Inquiry) commands described in Chapter 6.
  5566	
  5567	If you have view and configure privileges (set with %P1), you can use any 
  5568	of the modem commands, except those commands that cannot be used while 
  5569	online, such as the Dial command.  You can also use the remote 
  5570	configuration commands explained later.
  5571	
  5572	When you make remote configuration changes, the remote prompt is altered to 
  5573	indicate that changes have been made.  The prompt will change from:
  5574	
  5575	             Remote->
  5576	                to
  5577	             Remote+>
  5578	
  5579	If you restore the original configuration (with %C1, explained next), the 
  5580	original prompt is also restored (back to Remote->), indicating that the 
  5581	original configuration is intact.
  5582	
  5583	By default, configuration changes do not take effect until the connection 
  5584	is terminated (see %Cn).  However, the new configuration is immediately 
  5585	reflected on the information screens (ATIn).
  5586	
  5587	*****************************
  5588	Remote Configuration Commands
  5589	There are some additional commands that are only executable during a remote 
  5590	access session.  These commands are as follows.
  5591	
  5592	%Bn     Configure the Courier's serial port rate.  
  5593	        %B0   110 bps              %B6    9600 bps
  5594	        %B1   300 bps              %B7    19,200 bps
  5595	        %B2   600 bps              %B8    38,400 bps
  5596	        %B3   1200 bps             %B9    57,600 bps
  5597	        %B4   2400 bps             %B10   115,200 bps
  5598	        %B5   4800 bps
  5599	
  5600	%Cn     Configuration control.
  5601	        %C0   Defer configuration.   This is the default.  Configuration 
  5602	              changes are deferred until the call is ended; they take effect 
  5603	              for ensuing connections.  You do not need to enter this 
  5604	              command; it is the default unless you enter %C1 or %C2.
  5605	        %C1   Restore configuration.  Use this command to cancel any 
  5606	              configuration changes made during remote access, and 
  5607	              restore the original configuration.  However, commands that 
  5608	              have been written to NVRAM (with &W) will not be restored to 
  5609	              their previous settings.  Additionally, if you have forced 
  5610	              immediate configuration changes (with %C2), those changes 
  5611	              cannot be reversed with %C1.
  5612	        %C2   Execute configuration.  Use this command to force 
  5613	              configuration changes to take effect immediately, 
  5614	              during the current connection.  We recommend against 
  5615	              forcing immediate configuration changes unless absolutely 
  5616	              necessary, as this can result in an unreliable connection 
  5617	              or even a loss of connection.
  5618	
  5619	%Fn     Configure data format.
  5620	        %F0   No parity, 8 data bits.
  5621	        %F1   Mark parity, 7 data bits.
  5622	        %F2   Odd parity, 7 data bits.
  5623	        %F3   Even parity, 7 data bits.
  5624	
  5625	Password Commands
  5626	%Pn=    Disables password security (n=0 or 1) when no character follows 
  5627	        the equal sign.
  5628	
  5629	%Pn=s   Specify the following password string (s) for viewing privileges 
  5630	        only (n = 0) or view and configuration privileges (n= 1).        
  5631	
  5632	%Pn?    Display password n.
  5633	
  5634	Command Format
  5635	When typing commands during the remote access session, no delay between 
  5636	command strings is necessary.  For example, you can type the following 
  5637	commands without pausing after each one:
  5638	
  5639	* a password:  ABCDEF <Enter>
  5640	* a configuration string: AT&H1&R2&W <Enter>
  5641	* and a request for an information screen: ATI5 <Enter>
  5642	
  5643	The maximum number of characters between carriage returns is 40.  
  5644	
  5645	
  5646	Ending a Remote Access Session
  5647	One of four commands ends a remote access session.
  5648	* <Ctrl>-C aborts the login procedure.
  5649	* ATZ resets the modem and terminates the connection.
  5650	* ATH terminates the connection.
  5651	* ATO or ends the remote access session, but the modems remain online.
  5652	
  5653	**********************************
  5654	Configuring Dial Security Remotely
  5655	The system administrator can configure host Courier security account 
  5656	information with a Courier modem at a remote site using the procedures 
  5657	described below.  
  5658	
  5659	NOTE:  Before remote configuration is possible, the local modem's remote 
  5660	access must be enabled, and a remote access password that allows viewing 
  5661	and configuration privileges must be assigned.  For convenience, you may 
  5662	want to use your local access password as your remote access password.
  5663	
  5664	Dialing In From the Remote Site
  5665	1. From the remote site, connect to the host modem using Dial Security.  
  5666	   Once a connection is made, follow the instructions for beginning a 
  5667	   remote access session as described earlier in this appendix.
  5668	
  5669	2. When remote access has been granted, use the %S= command to access the 
  5670	   Dial Security accounts.
  5671	
  5672	3. If you wish, you can view account information by typing the following 
  5673	   Inquiry (I) command:
  5674	
  5675	         AT I10 <Enter>
  5676	
  5677	4. Make any configuration changes and execute them immediately by typing 
  5678	   the following command:
  5679	
  5680	        AT %C2 <Enter>
  5681	
  5682	5. To end the remote session and reactivate local access security on the 
  5683	   host modem, reset the modem by typing:
  5684	
  5685	        ATZ <Enter>
  5686	
  5687	WARNING:  If you do not use the ATZ command to end a remote access session, 
  5688	local access security will remain disabled at the host Courier site and 
  5689	anyone dialing in to your modem for remote access will have access to the 
  5690	I10 screen and all Security accounts.
  5691	
  5692	Appendix E--Troubleshooting
  5693	
  5694	
  5695	You may occasionally encounter one of the problems listed here.  They are 
  5696	divided into three categories:  Running the SDL.EXE Upgrade Program, Before 
  5697	Establishing the Link, and During Data Transfer.
  5698	
  5699	***********************************
  5700	Running the SDL.EXE Upgrade Program     
  5701	
  5702	Your modem . . .
  5703	
  5704	Is indicating an error
  5705	   Try running the SDL program at a lower serial port rate.  If your 
  5706	   computer doesn’t have a 16550 UART, a slower serial port rate can 
  5707	   make all the difference.
  5708	
  5709	   You can also try running the program on a different PC.  An 
  5710	   idiosyncracy of an off-brand PC or an uncommon version of DOS may 
  5711	   lock up the SDL program.
  5712	
  5713	***************************
  5714	Before Establishing the Link    
  5715	
  5716	Your modem . . .
  5717	
  5718	Doesn't answer the phone or go off hook to dial a number
  5719	   Review your communications software manual to see what Data Terminal 
  5720	   Ready (DTR) operations your software requires.  Then check to see if 
  5721	   DIP switch 1 is set correctly.  Also, check to make sure your terminal 
  5722	   or computer is sending a DTR signal via the RS-232 interface.
  5723	
  5724	Doesn't respond OK when you type AT <Enter>
  5725	   1. Make sure you're typing in either upper case or lower case letters, 
  5726	      not a combination, and that you press the Enter key.
  5727	   
  5728	   2. If you're using a computer, make sure it is in Terminal mode.  This 
  5729	      is a communications software function.  See Testing the Modem in 
  5730	      Chapter 2.
  5731	   
  5732	   3. Check to see that your terminal or software is set to the correct 
  5733	      bit rate and word length (7 bits with or without a parity bit, or 
  5734	      8 bits and no parity).  If you're using a computer, make sure your 
  5735	      software is set to the correct communications port.
  5736	   
  5737	   4. Check that DIP switch 8 is ON, for command set recognition.  If the 
  5738	      switch is OFF, power off the modem, set the switch ON, and power on 
  5739	      the modem again.  Try typing AT <Enter> again.
  5740	   
  5741	   5. Check that DIP switch 3 is ON, for result code display, and that 
  5742	      DIP switch 2 is OFF, for verbal result codes.  If not, change the 
  5743	      switch(es) and type ATZ <Enter>.  Or type whichever of these commands 
  5744	      is needed:
  5745	
  5746	          ATQ0 <Enter>    (to enable the message)
  5747	          ATV1 <Enter>    (to display a verbal message)
  5748	
  5749	   6. Review your communications software manual to see what Carrier 
  5750	      Detect (CD) operations your software requires.  Then check to see 
  5751	      if DIP switch 6 is set correctly. 
  5752	   
  5753	   7. A rare condition is that your terminal or computer reverses the 
  5754	      send/receive functions at the RS-232 interface.  See your equipment 
  5755	      documentation.
  5756	
  5757	Displays double characters
  5758	   Both your modem's and software's local echo are on.  You can turn your 
  5759	   software's local echo off.  Or turn the modem's echo off by either 
  5760	   resetting DIP switch 4 and sending the modem the ATZ command, or by 
  5761	   sending the modem the ATE0 command.
  5762	
  5763	
  5764	Your computer . . .
  5765	
  5766	Reacts as though a data link has been established, but no call has been 
  5767	received
  5768	
  5769	   DIP switch 6 is set ON at the factory for Carrier Detect (CD) override, 
  5770	   but your system may require that the override be turned OFF.  
  5771	   
  5772	   Review your terminal's manual or your communications software manual to 
  5773	   see what CD operations are required.  Then check to see if DIP switch 
  5774	   6 is set correctly.
  5775	
  5776	When the modem is in Answer mode, it acts as though a Carriage Return has 
  5777	been entered, but nothing has been typed at the keyboard
  5778	
  5779	   Your software may be misreading signals from the modem as it 
  5780	   automatically sends a Carriage Return and a Line Feed before and after 
  5781	   the RING and CONNECT messages.  Sending the Quiet mode command, ATQ1 
  5782	   <Enter>, should solve the problem.
  5783	
  5784	
  5785	Both modems . . .
  5786	
  5787	Exchange carrier signals, but fail to establish a communications link
  5788	   1. If you have a fax modem, make sure it is in the correct mode, fax 
  5789	      or data, depending on whether the connection is to be made with a 
  5790	      facsimile device or a data modem.  See Fax Operations in Chapter 5 
  5791	      for information on switching between Fax and Data modes.
  5792	   
  5793	   2. Asynchronous operations:  Check to make sure the proper bit rate, 
  5794	      word length, parity and number of Stop bits have been selected.  
  5795	      Synchronous operations:  review the link instructions in Appendix F. 
  5796	      If you've set the modem to the correct configuration, the problem may 
  5797	      be with the synchronous adapter or with the system you're trying to 
  5798	      call.
  5799	   
  5800	   3. Check to see that your modem is at the correct Bn setting to connect 
  5801	      with either an HST modem (B1 setting) or V.32 terbo modem (B0 setting).  
  5802	      Type ATI4 for a display of the Courier's current settings and, if 
  5803	      necessary, send the modem the correct setting.
  5804	   
  5805	   4. If your modem is attempting to answer a V.32 call, you may need to 
  5806	      lengthen the extra V.32 answer tones.  See S28 in Appendix B.
  5807	   
  5808	   5. Depending on your model, make sure the modem at the other end of the 
  5809	      line is HST compatible, V.32 terbo compatible at 14.4K bps, or V.32 
  5810	      compatible at 9600 bps, V.22 bis-compatible at 2400 bps, Bell 
  5811	      212A-compatible at 1200 bps, or Bell 103-compatible at 300 bps.  
  5812	      These are the common signaling standards for full duplex dial-up 
  5813	      network transmission in the U.S.
  5814	   
  5815	   6. Make sure your modem's connection rate setting, &Nn is correct for 
  5816	      the call.  If the connection rate is locked at a speed (&N1-&N14) 
  5817	      different from the calling modem's, the Courier hangs up.  The 
  5818	      factory setting of &N0, variable link operations, allows the two 
  5819	      modems to negotiate the highest possible connection rate.
  5820	   
  5821	   7. If none of the above corrects the problem, it's likely that the 
  5822	      quality of the phone connection is poor and that the other modem is 
  5823	      missing the signals your modem is transmitting.  The variable 
  5824	      quality of phone line connections may be due to any number of 
  5825	      conditions in the phone service's equipment or the current 
  5826	      environment.  Try several calls, and if you still can't get through, 
  5827	      try calling another modem.  If the second modem accepts your call, 
  5828	      the problem may lie with the modem you first tried to call.
  5829	
  5830	
  5831	********************
  5832	During Data Transfer
  5833	
  5834	Your screen displays . . .
  5835	
  5836	Only brackets
  5837	   Check to make sure that both modems are set to the same bit rate, word 
  5838	   length, parity and number of Stop bits.  If the settings are correct, 
  5839	   the problem may be with the phone line.  Try the following measures:
  5840	   
  5841	   1. Try placing the call again.  The phone company routes even local 
  5842	      calls differently each time you call.
  5843	   
  5844	   2. Try calling a different modem to see if the problem persists.  The 
  5845	      problem may be with the modem you first tried to call.
  5846	
  5847	Random or garbage characters
  5848	   Check to make sure that both modems are set to the same bit rate, word 
  5849	   length, parity, and number of Stop bits.
  5850	
  5851	   If the modem is set to a fixed serial port rate (&B1) and your software 
  5852	   is fixed at 19.2K, 38.4K, 57.6K, or 115.2K bps, the reason may be one 
  5853	   of the following:
  5854	   
  5855	   1. Your computer may not support the high rate.  If this is the case, 
  5856	      fix your software rate at 9600 bps and disable high-speed V.32 terbo 
  5857	      modulation: ATS34=3 or ATS34 .0=1 .1=1. 
  5858	   
  5859	   2. If you use memory-resident programs (TSRs), they may be interfering.  
  5860	      Try disabling them before you run your communications software.  
  5861	      The same is true of disk-caching programs.
  5862	   
  5863	   3. Check to see that your software and the modem are set for the same 
  5864	      kind of flow control, either hardware or software.  Some 
  5865	      communications programs also require that you disable the kind 
  5866	      you are not using.
  5867	
  5868	Double characters
  5869	   Your modem's online local echo is on and the remote modem is also 
  5870	   echoing.  The only way to correct this is to bring the modem back 
  5871	   to Command mode (wait one second without transmitting data, type 
  5872	   +++, wait another second).  Then type the command to turn off your 
  5873	   online echo (ATF1 <Enter>).
  5874	
  5875	   If DIP switch 9 is OFF (factory setting), the modem hangs up when it

  5882	IF YOU STILL HAVE PROBLEMS      
  5883	
  5884	The problems described above are by far the most common ones that users 
  5885	encounter.  If the suggestions we've given don't clear up your difficulties, 
  5886	try the following:
  5887	
  5888	1. Review the manual carefully to see if you've missed something.
  5889	
  5890	2. Call or visit your modem dealer.  Chances are your dealer will be able 
  5891	   to give you the assistance you need.  This is much more efficient and 
  5892	   time-saving than returning the modem to U.S. Robotics.
  5893	
  5894	3. If your dealer can't help you, refer to the Customer Service Access 
  5895	   Card provided in this package.  This card lists several important U. S. 
  5896	   Robotics numbers.
  5897	
  5898	4. If you must return your modem to us, the Service Representative you 
  5899	   talk to will give you a Return Materials Authorization (RMA) number.  
  5900	   Modems without an RMA number will not be accepted.
  5901	
  5902	5. If you do return the modem to us, please use the following procedures.
  5903	   a. Ship the unit, postage paid, in its original container.  If the 
  5904	      original container is not available, pack the modem carefully in a

  5925	
  5926	
  5927	___________________________________________________________________________
  5928	SYNCHRONOUS APPLICATIONS
  5929	
  5930	Synchronous mode is required for users who need to call, or receive 
  5931	calls, from a Host computer of a large network.  The Host is usually 
  5932	a mainframe.  There are two ways the Courier can operate in synchronous 
  5933	mode:
  5934	
  5935	* Selecting the ITU-T standard V.25 bis protocol, which formats data in 
  5936	  HDLC or character-oriented frames.  This method is used by mainframe 
  5937	  operators and synchronous terminal users.
  5938	
  5939	  V.25 bis acts as an interface between the mainframe and modem, sending 
  5940	  synchronous responses.  An asynchronous device or a "dumb" terminal 
  5941	  is used to configure the modem before it dials out in synchronous mode. 
  5942	
  5943	* Dedicating a PC as a synchronous device by installing the proper 
  5944	  hardware and software so it can communicate with a mainframe.  The modem 
  5945	  is configured and dials out in asynchronous mode, then switches to 
  5946	  synchronous mode once a connection is made.
  5947	
  5948	NOTE:  HST modulation is not supported for synchronous communications.
  5949	
  5950	********************
  5951	GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
  5952	
  5953	Courier modems in asynchronous mode adapt to many conditions of remote 
  5954	asynchronous modems.  But synchronous connections to a mainframe require 
  5955	strict adherence to specific operating parameters.  If you are operating 
  5956	a terminal designed for a particular network, you probably need only set 
  5957	the Courier properly before calling or answering.
  5958	
  5959	NOTE:  The term DTE in the following discussion means Data Terminal 
  5960	Equipment, the end-to-end equipment involved in data communications.  
  5961	DTE denotes your terminal or computer and the remote computer.
  5962	
  5963	*********************
  5964	What You Need to Know
  5965	The network's communications management staff can supply information on 
  5966	the following requirements:
  5967	* The protocol needed for your calls
  5968	* The software support needed to log into the network; for example, a 
  5969	  specific communications package or interface board
  5970	* The phone number, if you will be calling instead of answering
  5971	* Any restrictions about when you can call
  5972	
  5973	********************
  5974	The RS-232 Interface
  5975	Transmit and Receive synchronous timing pins are required at the RS-232 
  5976	interface.  You'll need either pin 15 or pin 24 for Transmitter timing 
  5977	signals, depending on whether the modem (pin 15) or the DTE (pin 24) 
  5978	generates the signals.  You'll also need pin 17, for Receiver timing 
  5979	signals.  If you're building your own cable, review the RS-232 Interface, 
  5980	in Appendix B.
  5981	
  5982	**********************
  5983	Protocol Compatibility
  5984	The devices at both ends of the link must use the same protocol.  These 
  5985	protocols format data into blocks or frames and add control information.
  5986	
  5987	If the modem is in V.25 bis mode, the link protocol must be HDLC 
  5988	(High-Level Data Link Control), or character-oriented.  If the modem 
  5989	is in Online Synchronous mode it may use HDLC, character-oriented, or 
  5990	another protocol determined by the mainframe manufacturer.  
  5991	
  5992	******************************
  5993	Data Rate Synchronization (&Xn)
  5994	During synchronous operations, transmit and receive clocks at both ends 
  5995	of the phone link control the precise timing of the data flow.  The 
  5996	communications equipment at the remote DTE and your modem and DTE must 
  5997	all handle the data at the same speed.
  5998	
  5999	The transmit clock timing signals setting, &Xn, determines whether the 
  6000	modem or DTE will generate the timing signals.  For Online synchronous 
  6001	operations, the source for this setting must be the same on both systems.  
  6002	See Connection Rate (%Nn, &Nn) later in this appendix.
  6003	
  6004	Most Online synchronous users will require the default setting, &X0.
  6005	
  6006	&X0  The Courier is the source of the Transmit clock timing signals and 
  6007	     sends them to your DTE over the RS-232 interface.  The DTE rate will 
  6008	     follow the connection rates.  Default.
  6009	
  6010	&X1  The DTE is the source of the Transmit clock timing signals and sends 
  6011	     them to the Courier over the RS-232 interface.  This setting is used 
  6012	     typically in leased line multiplexed operations.  (Multiplexors divide 
  6013	     the phone channel so that the channel carries several calls at the 
  6014	     same time.)  
  6015	     
  6016	     The DTE ignores the Courier's clock timing signals and negotiates 
  6017	     the DTE and connection rates.
  6018	
  6019	&X2  The Courier's Receiver clock is the source of the timing signals.  
  6020	     The signals are looped to the Transmit clock and sent to your DTE 
  6021	     over the RS-232 interface.  This setting is only used in those 
  6022	     systems that require synchronization of data flowing in both directions.
  6023	
  6024	
  6025	**********************
  6026	V.25 BIS RREQUIREMENTS
  6027	
  6028	V.25 bis is an ITU-T standard that uses the HDLC or character-oriented 
  6029	protocols to format data.
  6030	
  6031	Before you attempt to connect to a synchronous network, you must configure 
  6032	the modem in command (asynchronous) mode by using either an asynchronous 
  6033	device or dumb terminal.  V.25 bis commands are used for this purpose.  
  6034	The computer or terminal sends V.25 bis commands to the modem to ready 
  6035	the line for synchronous transmission.  Once the synchronous connection 
  6036	is made and the modem is in synchronous mode, V.25 bis commands are no 
  6037	longer necessary and are ignored.  The modems on each end of the 
  6038	connection are transparent to the host computers or terminals.
  6039	
  6040	To set the modem, follow the instructions in Chapter 4, Command Set Usage.  
  6041	Commands begin with a required AT prefix and end with a required Carriage 
  6042	Return, which we denote with the symbol <Enter>.  For example, the 
  6043	following command causes the modem to set the connection rates, enable 
  6044	normal result codes, enable auto answer, select HDLC as a link protocol, 
  6045	and save the settings to NVRAM.  Spaces have been added only for 
  6046	readability.
  6047	
  6048	        AT &N0 %N6 X0 S0=1 &M7 &W <Enter>
  6049	
  6050	Be sure that DIP switch 10 is OFF so that the modem loads the settings 
  6051	you've stored in nonvolatile random access memory (NVRAM) when it 
  6052	powers on.  Until you customize your own settings, the settings in 
  6053	NVRAM are the same as the &F1 Hardware Flow Control template.
  6054	
  6055	**************************
  6056	Connection Rate (&Nn, %Nn)
  6057	There are three phases to obtaining and maintaining a connection rate 
  6058	during synchronous communication.  
  6059	
  6060	Clock Speed Control
  6061	The first phase is in deciding where the clock speed will be determined.  
  6062	(See Data Rate Synchronization, above.)
  6063	
  6064	Offline Host/Modem Clock Speed
  6065	The second phase involves the data rate between the host computer or 
  6066	terminal and its modem during offline mode.  The %N command is used to 
  6067	set the clock speed between the modem and host, but this speed is only 
  6068	during offline mode, before the synchronous connection is made.  
  6069	The %Nn command works in conjunction with &Xn.  If the modem is set so 
  6070	that it is the source of the Transmit clock timing signals 
  6071	(&X0--default), the %Nn commands set the computer or terminal-to-modem 
  6072	V.25 bis clock speed.  If the modem is set to &X1, the computer is the 
  6073	source of the Transmit clock signals.  
  6074	
  6075	If %Nn is set to 0 or 1, you will receive an error message, since they 
  6076	are not valid values.  The %Nn rates are as follows:
  6077	%N0   Reserved           %N6    9600 bps (default)
  6078	%N1   Reserved           %N7    12.K bps
  6079	%N2   1200 bps           %N8    14.4K bps
  6080	%N3   2400 bps           %N9    16.8K bps
  6081	%N4   4800 bps           %N10   19.2K bps 
  6082	%N5   7200 bps
  6083	
  6084	Online Connection Rate
  6085	The &N command sets the data rate during the synchronous connection.
  6086	
  6087	If &Nn is set for 2-10, the modem ignores the %Nn rate and follows 
  6088	the &Nn rate to set the Online connection rate.  The &Nn rates are 
  6089	as follows:
  6090	&N0        Variable (default)   &N6     9600 bps
  6091	&N1        Reserved             &N7     12K bps
  6092	&N2        1200 bps             &N8     14.4K bps
  6093	&N3        2400 bps             &N9     16.8K bps       
  6094	&N4        4800 bps                      (terbo-terbo only)
  6095	&N5        7200 bps             &N10    19.2K bps 
  6096	                                         (terbo-terbo only)
  6097	
  6098	Recommended Settings
  6099	When the connection is made and the data rate is determined, host/modem 
  6100	rates may change dramatically to match the connection rate (when in 
  6101	online synchronous mode, the modem is transparent on the line).  To 
  6102	avoid this dramatic rate switching (which can be hard on some computers), 
  6103	we recommend that the modem be set with a fixed rate between the computer 
  6104	or terminal and modem (%Nn) and that the connection rate (&Nn) be set to 
  6105	the same rate.  
  6106	
  6107	*****************
  6108	Result Codes (Xn)
  6109	The Courier displays normal or extended synchronous result codes, 
  6110	depending on the setting of the Xn command.  By default, the modem is 
  6111	set to X1 for extended result codes.  To change to normal result codes, 
  6112	set the modem to X0.
  6113	
  6114	The normal result codes return messages such as VAL or INV (VALID or 
  6115	INVALID), whereas the extended codes offer explanations--
  6116	INVPS (INVALID Parameter Syntax Error).
  6117	
  6118	**************************
  6119	Automatic Answering (S0=1)
  6120	When the Courier is operating in V.25 bis mode, it ignores the DIP 
  6121	switch 5 setting, which controls Auto Answer.  To set the modem to 
  6122	automatically answer incoming calls, set the modem to S0=1, so it 
  6123	answers on the first ring.  You can substitute a higher value.  See 
  6124	the S-Register summary in Appendix B.
  6125	
  6126	Suppressing Auto Answer
  6127	To disable Auto Answer, set the modem to answer on zero rings, S0=0.
  6128	
  6129	*************************************
  6130	Choosing a Synchronous Protocol (&Mn)
  6131	Once the &Xn, %Nn, &Nn, Xn, and S0 commands are configured, you must 
  6132	use the &Mn command to choose the HDLC or character-oriented link 
  6133	protocol so that your synchronous software can properly format its 
  6134	commands.
  6135	
  6136	&M6     Use the character-oriented protocol for synchronous communications.  
  6137	
  6138	        The Courier and the remote modem must use the same eight-bit data 
  6139	        format.  The character length must be 7 bits and either ODD or 
  6140	        EVEN parity (ODD is preferred), or 8 bits and NO parity.
  6141	
  6142	&M7     Use the High Level Data Link Control (HDLC), an ITU-T standard 
  6143	        for synchronous communications.  HDLC ignores parity.
  6144	
  6145	
  6146	**********************************
  6147	V.25 bis Commands and Result Codes 
  6148	
  6149	Commands
  6150	* CIC (Connect incoming call) Instructs the modem to answer an incoming 
  6151	  call.
  6152	* CRN (Call request using number provided )Instructs the modem to dial 
  6153	  the number following this command.
  6154

  6217	
  6218	**********
  6219	Hanging Up
  6220	Since the modem cannot accept commands once it is connected in synchronous 
  6221	mode, you cannot use the ATH (hang up) command or the +++ escape sequence.
  6222	
  6223	The only way for the modem to disconnect is to drop its DTR signal.  This 
  6224	is normally done with software.  However, if the modem is initially set 
  6225	to S32=6 when it is in asynchronous mode, the modem will reset when the 
  6226	voice/data switch is pressed, thus dropping DTR. 
  6227	
  6228	******************************
  6229	Returning to Asynchronous Mode
  6230	Once you've completed a communication session, you can switch between 
  6231	synchronous and asynchronous modes by flipping DIP switch 10 OFF 
  6232	(factory settings, asynchronous mode) and then ON (NVRAM settings, 
  6233	synchronous mode if the modem is set to &M6 or &M7).
  6234	
  6235	The modem cannot switch between synchronous and asynchronous while a call 
  6236	is connected.
  6237	
  6238	*******************************
  6239	ONLINE SYNCHRONOUS REQUIREMENTS
  6240	
  6241	Although personal computers do not usually support synchronous 
  6242	communications, they can be dedicated to do so.  If you have a personal 
  6243	computer you must find out what hardware and software you need before 
  6244	setting the Courier for synchronous calls.
  6245	
  6246	****************************
  6247	The Synchronous Adapter Card
  6248	You will probably have to purchase and install a synchronous adapter 
  6249	card.  These cards are multifunction boards that provide the following 
  6250	functions:
  6251	* A synchronous port from the DTE to the modem
  6252	
  6253	* One or more synchronous protocols.  Be sure to find out which protocol 
  6254	  the Host mainframe requires before you purchase an adapter.
  6255	
  6256	* Additional software functions.  For example, you need to identify the 
  6257	  type of computer or terminal you are using to the mainframe software.  
  6258	  You will most likely also have to specify your application--that is, 
  6259	  identify the mainframe resources you want to use. 
  6260	
  6261	*****************
  6262	Setting the Modem 
  6263	When the modem is set to Online Synchronous mode, it remains in command 
  6264	(asynchronous) mode until it makes a synchronous connection with a remote 
  6265	modem.  Upon connection, the Courier enters synchronous mode and sends 
  6266	synchronous timing signals to your DTE.
  6267	
  6268	Because the modem will not accept commands when it is in synchronous mode, 
  6269	you will have to configure it in asynchronous mode before trying to connect 
  6270	to a synchronous network.
  6271	
  6272	NOTE:  Be sure that DIP switch 1 is OFF (factory setting).  The Data 
  6273	Terminal Ready (DTR) override must be OFF so that the Courier detects 
  6274	when the DTE raises and lowers the DTR signal.
  6275	
  6276	To set the modem, follow the instructions for issuing commands in Chapter 
  6277	4, Command Set Usage.  Commands begin with a required AT prefix and end 
  6278	with a required Carriage Return, which we denote with the symbol <Enter>.  
  6279	
  6280	For example, the following command causes the modem to set the modulation, 
  6281	the connection rate, and choose a timing source.  Spaces have been added 
  6282	only for readability.

  6293	If the modem is connecting with another U.S. Robotics V.32 terbo modem, 
  6294	set both modems to B0 and to a variable connection rate, &N0.  The modems 
  6295	will connect at the highest possible rate.  
  6296	
  6297	If the Courier V.32 terbo is to connect with a V.32 modem, set the Courier 
  6298	to B0 and try a variable connection rate first, &N0.  If that doesn't work, 
  6299	try a fixed connection rate of &N6 (9600 bps) or &N3 (2400 bps).
  6300	
  6301	Modems in HST mode
  6302	HST modulation for synchronous communications is not supported.  
  6303	
  6304	Dual Standard modems
  6305	Set the Dual Standard modem to B0.  Try a variable connection rate 
  6306	setting (&N0) first.  If that doesn't work, you may have to set a fixed 
  6307	connection rate, for example, &N6 (9600 bps).
  6308	
  6309	NOTE:  If your modem is set to a fixed rate, and the remote modem is not 
  6310	set to the same rate, your modem hangs up.
  6311	
  6312	*********************
  6313	Connection Rate (&Nn)
  6314	Use this command to set variable or fixed rates at the link interface.  The 
  6315	default is &N0, variable rate.  The Courier negotiates with the remote 
  6316	modem for the highest possible connection rate, depending on the 
  6317	capabilities of the remote modem.  If &N0 does not work, try a fixed 
  6318	rate.
  6319	
  6320	NOTE:  The modem is not capable of connecting at 21.6K bps in synchronous 
  6321	mode.
  6322	
  6323	When you set the modem to a fixed rate, it will only connect if the remote 
  6324	modem is operating at the same rate.  If not, your modem hangs up.
  6325	
  6326	The fixed rate options are as follows:
  6327	&N0       Variable rate &N6     9600 bps
  6328	&N1       Reserved      &N7     12K bps
  6329	&N2       1200 bps      &N8     14.4K bps
  6330	&N3       2400 bps      &N9     16.8K bps 
  6331	&N4       4800 bps              (terbo-terbo only)
  6332	&N5       7200 bps      &N10    19.2K bps (terbo-terbo only)
  6333

  6335	*******************************
  6336	Generating Clock Timing Signals
  6337	The &Xn setting specifies whether the Courier or your DTE generates the 
  6338	Transmit clock timing signals for a synchronous call.  Most users will 
  6339	require the default setting, &X0.  See Data Rate Synchronization (&Xn), 
  6340	earlier in this appendix, for more information.
  6341	
  6342	
  6343	***********
  6344	Dialing Out
  6345	The modem's stored command feature (&ZC=s) allows you to configure the 
  6346	modem for a synchronous connection and to dial out to the Host computer 
  6347	by just pressing the voice/data switch.  Below are our recommended 
  6348	procedures.
  6349	
  6350	1. If your communications software isn't running, load the program and 
  6351	   put the computer in Terminal mode, as described in Chapter 2.  
  6352	   Terminal mode allows you to send AT commands directly to the modem.
  6353	
  6354	2. Using the guidelines in Chapter 4, store a command string (&ZC=s) 
  6355	   that configures the modem according to the Host computer's requirements.  
  6356	   In addition, include the &M1 command, to have the modem enter synchronous 
  6357	   mode, followed by the appropriate Dial string.  The following is an 
  6358	   example:
  6359	
  6360	           AT &ZC = &F &X1 &M1 DT5551234 <Enter>
  6361	
  6362	   In the example, &F sets the modem's defaults as those of the &F0 
  6363	   template settings, while &X1, which specifies the computer as the 
  6364	   synchronous timing source, is the only non-default setting used besides 
  6365	   synchronous mode (&M1).  Any non-default settings should follow the &F 
  6366	   command.  The Dial command should be the last entry before the Carriage 
  6367	   Return.  
  6368	
  6369	3. Set the voice/data switch to option 9, so that the modem executes the 
  6370	   stored command string when you press the switch.  Type the following:
  6371	
  6372	          ATS32 = 9 <Enter>
  6373	
  6374	   NOTE:  If you usually use the voice/data switch for another purpose, 
  6375	   you can include the execute stored command option (S32 = 9) in the stored 
  6376	   command string.  However, the total number of characters in the string 
  6377	   may not exceed 30.  
  6378	
  6379	   If S32=9 is used with the stored command string, it over-writes any 
  6380	   other S32 option.  Once the communication session is over, you will have 
  6381	   to reset S32 if you want to select another option.
  6382	
  6383	4. Press the voice/data switch when you want to connect with the synchronous 
  6384	   Host computer.  You need not have your communications software loaded 
  6385	   at the time.
  6386	
  6387	5. After the call, restore the modem to asynchronous operations by 
  6388	   powering it off and on again.
  6389	
  6390	
  6391	*********
  6392	Answering
  6393	To configure the modem for Answer mode using the voice/data switch, follow 
  6394	the instructions in the previous section, Dialing Out, but with these 
  6395	modifications:
  6396	
  6397	* Insert S0 = 1 in the stored command, Step 2.  This sets the modem to 
  6398	  Auto Answer.
  6399	
  6400	* Omit the Dial string shown in the same step (DT and phone number).  
  6401	
  6402	If you don't wish to use a stored command and the voice/data switch, send 
  6403	the modem the appropriate configuration string, ending with &M1.  The 
  6404	following command adapts the dial-out command example.  Note again that 
  6405	all non-default settings follow the &F command.
  6406	
  6407	          AT &F S0=1 &X1 &M1 <Enter>
  6408	
  6409	The modem responds automatically to an incoming call, enters synchronous 
  6410	mode and, in this case (because it is set to &X1), waits for synchronous 
  6411	timing signals from your DTE.
  6412	
  6413	
  6414	**********
  6415	Hanging Up
  6416	The modem remains online until the remote modem disconnects or your 
  6417	software causes the DTE to drop the Data Terminal Ready signal (DTR).  
  6418	The Courier sends the NO CARRIER result code if result codes are enabled, 
  6419	and returns to asynchronous Command mode.
  6420	
  6421	****************************
  6422	Testing and Inquiry Commands
  6423	The modem testing commands (&Tn) and inquiry commands (In) cannot be used 
  6424	when the modem is operating in synchronous mode.
  6425	
  6426	
  6427	**********************
  6428	ENABLING REMOTE ACCESS
  6429	
  6430	Because synchronous equipment cannot use AT commands to configure modems, 
  6431	a special function was designed so the modem can receive AT commands 
  6432	remotely.  To do this, the modem must be placed in remote access mode 
  6433	with the voice/data switch.
  6434	
  6435	Press and hold down the voice/data switch while powering on the modem.  
  6436	Pressing the switch during power-on causes the modem to perform its normal 
  6437	self-test, enable Auto Answer, enable Remote Access (by changing the S41 
  6438	setting to 1), and disable password security.
  6439	
  6440	WARNING:  If you enable remote access by pressing the voice/data switch 
  6441	while powering on the modem, previously set passwords will be erased. 
  6442	
  6443	
  6444	________________________________________________________________________
  6445	DEDICATED AND LEASED LINE OPERATIONS
  6446	
  6447	The following operations apply in installations where the modem's phone 
  6448	line is not part of a public-access switched telephone network.  Instead, 
  6449	the modem is connected to a special user-installed telephone line or a 
  6450	line that is leased from the telephone company.  These lines are often 
  6451	referred to as dedicated (to a pair of modems) or private lines.  
  6452	
  6453	In both types of installation there is a continuous point-to-point 
  6454	connection between two modems.  No dialing of phone numbers is required.  
  6455	The modems may be in either Smart or Dumb mode (determined by the position 
  6456	of DIP switch 8).  
  6457	
  6458	*******************************************
  6459	The User-Installed or Leased Telephone Line
  6460	User-installed lines are most commonly 2-wire lines, similar to the 2-wire 
  6461	lines that connect residential phones to the public switched network.  
  6462	
  6463	If you are leasing a line from the telephone company, request a 2-wire 
  6464	line, the type of line the modem is designed to work with.  If the 
  6465	telephone company only makes a 4-wire line available, you'll need a 
  6466	4-wire to 2-wire converter at each end of the connection.  If the phone 
  6467	company does not install the converters, you will have to supply them.  
  6468	
  6469	For optimal operations, we recommend that the physical length of these 
  6470	lines not exceed 5 miles.
  6471	
  6472	*****************
  6473	Setting the Modem
  6474	If the Courier is set to &L1, as described in what follows, and the 
  6475	remote AT-compatible modem has a comparable setting, they automatically 
  6476	connect when they are powered on.  They also reconnect, without any 
  6477	operator intervention, if a disturbance on the line is severe enough 
  6478	to break the connection.  
  6479	
  6480	Set the modem as follows:
  6481	1. Set your terminal or communications software to the rate at which you 
  6482	   want the modems to communicate.  For example, use a terminal/software 
  6483	   setting of 19.2K bps and, if both modems have the capability, they will 
  6484	   connect at 14.4K bps.  The following instructions assume that you are 
  6485	   familiar with the guidelines on using the &B and &H commands (Chapter 3) 
  6486	   and the &W command (Chapter 3).
  6487	
  6488	2. Send the modem the following command:
  6489	
  6490	        AT &B1 &S2 &H1 &L1 &W <Enter>
  6491	
  6492	   &B1 fixes the modem's computer interface rate at the same serial port 
  6493	   rate you selected when setting up your communications software.  &S2 
  6494	   causes the modem to send a Clear to Send (CTS) signal only after it 
  6495	   sends the Carrier Detect (CD) signal, that is, only after it connects 
  6496	   with the remote modem.  (See the note that follows.)  &H1 enables 
  6497	   hardware (CTS) flow control.  
  6498	   
  6499	   &L1 forces the modems off hook at power on and enables them to 
  6500	   re-establish the connection should it be broken.  &W writes the 
  6501	   settings to nonvolatile memory (NVRAM) as power-on defaults.  
  6502	   
  6503	   NOTE:  We recommend using the &S2 setting to delay CTS until after 
  6504	   the connection is made, as a precaution.  If the modems are in the 
  6505	   process of connecting or reconnecting, the Courier interprets any 
  6506	   keyboard data entry, including an accidental key stroke, as a 
  6507	   key-press abort, and hangs up.  Delaying CTS until after carrier 
  6508	   detection prevents this from happening, for example, if you are typing 
  6509	   data to the remote modem when the modems momentarily disconnect and 
  6510	   begin to reconnect.  However, you have to set the modem for hardware 
  6511	   flow control, &H1.
  6512	
  6513	   If your software or machine does not support Clear to Send (CTS), don't 
  6514	   include &S2 and &H1 in the command string as suggested above.  Follow 
  6515	   the Transmit Data flow control (&H) guidelines in Chapter 3.  But keep 
  6516	   in mind that if the modems fail to connect or reconnect, the reason 
  6517	   could be a key-press abort. 
  6518	
  6519	3. Set the modem to load NVRAM settings at power-on, DIP switch 10 OFF.  
  6520	   It does not matter if the modem is in Dumb or Smart mode (DIP switch 8).
  6521	
  6522	4. Decide which modem is to be the calling modem and which the answering 
  6523	   modem.  Set the answering modem to Auto Answer, DIP switch 5 OFF, and 
  6524	   the calling modem to Auto Answer suppressed, DIP switch 5 ON.
  6525	
  6526	5. Power off and power on the modems.  This initiates the new DIP switch 
  6527	   settings and loads the power-on defaults, including &L1.  The modems 
  6528	   go off hook and establish the connection.
  6529	
  6530	NOTE:  If the modems cannot restore the connection and you could not set 
  6531	the modem to &S2, the reason could be a key-press abort.  If the problem 
  6532	persists, however, you may need to call your telephone company to have 
  6533	them check your line.

  6547	CELLULAR OPERATIONS
  6548	
  6549	This function applies to Dual Standard HSTs only.  HST cellular modems 
  6550	can be used to answer or originate calls, but are proprietary.  They can 
  6551	only connect with other U.S. Robotics Dual Standard modems with HST cellular 
  6552	capabilities.
  6553	
  6554	To enable cellular mode, load the &F3 template settings by typing the 
  6555	following command:
  6556	
  6557	       AT &F3 <Enter>
  6558	
  6559	To save this as your power-on/default setting, type this: 
  6560	
  6561	       AT &F3 &W <Enter>
  6562	
  6563	The &F3 command sets the serial port rate to 19,200 bps, and formats the 
  6564	data for 8 bits, no parity and one stop bit.  The ini-tialization string 
  6565	sent to the modem by loading this template is shown below.
  6566	
  6567	      AT B1 X7 S10 = 30 &B1 &L2 &H1 &I0 &R2
  6568	
  6569	* B1--enables HST modulation 
  6570	* X7--displays extended result codes including NO DIAL TONE, RINGING, NO 
  6571	  ANSWER, and BUSY messages
  6572	* &B1--locks the serial port rate so that it remains higher than the 
  6573	  connection rate.
  6574	* S10=30--sets the modem to wait 3 seconds after loss of carrier before 
  6575	  hanging up.
  6576	* &L2--enables cellular mode
  6577	* &H1--enables hardware flow control
  6578	* &I0--disables software flow control
  6579	* &R2--sets the modem so it sends received data to the computer or terminal 
  6580	  when the Ready To Send (RTS) signal is high, only if the computer or 
  6581	  terminal supports RTS.
  6582	
  6583	The modem uses the U.S. Robotics proprietary HST cellular protocol to make 
  6584	connections.  The call starts at 1200 bps, a V.42 error control connection 
  6585	is negotiated, then the modem switches to 4800 bps and begins measuring the 
  6586	line conditions.  Depending on line conditions, the modem decreases or 
  6587	increases its connection rate, to a minimum speed of 300 bps and a maximum 
  6588	of 12K bps.  If a connection terminates before data transfer is completed, 
  6589	the system tries to re-establish the link and complete the transfer. 
  6590	
  6591	If a large number of blocks are being resent (shown by the ARQ LED flashing 
  6592	randomly; some software displays the blocks retransmitted in the file 
  6593	transfer window), you may want to reduce the packet size by doing the 
  6594	following:
  6595	
  6596	1. Be sure DIP switch 9 is ON so that the modem remains online if it 
  6597	   receives +++.
  6598	
  6599	2. If DIP switch 9 is OFF, switch it to ON and reset the modem by issuing 
  6600	   the ATZ command.
  6601	
  6602	3. Send the modem the escape sequence by typing +++ so that the 
  6603	   transmission is interrupted, and wait 1 second.
  6604	
  6605	4. Type AT S33=1 to reduce the packet size.
  6606	
  6607	5. Then type ATO so that the modem returns online and continues to transmit.
  6608	
  6609	NOTE:  HST cellular connections can only be made with other U.S. Robotics 
  6610	modems in HST cellular mode.  The modem cannot be used to place a voice or 
  6611	data call to another phone or modem when it is in this mode.
  6612	
  6613	
  6614	__________________________________________________________________________
  6615	VOICE/DATA (EXTERNAL MODEMS ONLY)
  6616	
  6617	The voice/data switch is located on the modem's front panel.  While the 
  6618	switch's primary function is to toggle back and forth between voice and 
  6619	data communications, this feature also allows you to perform other 
  6620	functions at the touch of a switch.  Use Register S32 to select these 
  6621	functions, as shown in Table G.1.
  6622	
  6623	Additionally, the Courier modem allows you to use the voice/data switch to 
  6624	set the modem for remote access if attached to certain synchronous devices.  
  6625	This is described in Enabling Remote Access in Appendix F.
  6626	
  6627	NOTE:  Use the voice/data switch when the modem is in Command mode 
  6628	(offline).  If you press the switch while the modem is online, the modem 
  6629	hangs up and returns a NO CARRIER result code.  
  6630	
  6631	**************************************************
  6632	VOICE/DATA OPERATIONS--S32=1, S32=2 or AT COMMANDS
  6633	
  6634	When you install the Courier, you have the option of plugging your phone 
  6635	into the second modular jack of the modem so it's available for voice calls.  
  6636	You can also switch between the phone and modem during a call.
  6637	
  6638	If the remote modem has handset exclusion, you can change from voice to 
  6639	data and back again, with or without issuing a command.  
  6640	
  6641	Handset exclusion means that if the modem is using the phone line, your 
  6642	phone (handset) is automatically disconnected.  However, if you keep 
  6643	the handset off hook, once you hang up the modem the handset takes over 
  6644	the phone line and you can use voice communications again.  If the remote 
  6645	user does not have handset exclusion, you may not be able to switch back 
  6646	to voice mode successfully once you have switched to Data mode.
  6647	
  6648	The following instructions describe how to toggle voice/data communications 
  6649	with the switch.  This is followed by instructions for doing the same 
  6650	thing with AT commands.  If the remote user does not have a switch, he 
  6651	or she can follow the instructions for using the appropriate AT command.
  6652	
  6653	*******************************
  6654	Voice/Data Switch--S32=1, S32=2
  6655	1. Phone the other user to establish the bit rate, parity, word length 
  6656	   and number of Stop bits the other person's modem accepts.  (Both 
  6657	   modems should be offline, in Command mode.)
  6658	
  6659	   You and the other user must also agree on which modem will go off hook 
  6660	   in Originate mode and which in Answer mode.  The Courier is factory 
  6661	   set to go off hook in Originate mode, S32=1.  The Answer modem should 
  6662	   have S32 set to 2.
  6663	
  6664	   NOTE:  If the stored command string command has been used (&ZC=s), the 
  6665	   modem will default to S32=9, which executes the stored command string 
  6666	   when the voice/data switch is pushed.
  6667	
  6668	   Either party's device can be the originate or answer modem;  it doesn't 
  6669	   matter who made the phone call.  But one modem must first enter 
  6670	   Originate mode and the other then enter Answer mode.  
  6671	   
  6672	2. Without hanging up the phone, press the voice/data switch.  
  6673	
  6674	   If S32 is set to 2, Answer mode, press the voice/data switch immediately 
  6675	   after the remote user forces the remote modem off hook in Originate mode.
  6676	
  6677	3. The other party should force the remote modem off hook in Answer mode 
  6678	   by pressing the switch.
  6679	
  6680	   If yours is the Answer modem (S32=2), the other party should press the 
  6681	   voice/data switch immediately before you do so.
  6682	
  6683	4. If the remote modem has handset exclusion, the remote user should also 
  6684	   keep the phone off hook in order to switch back to voice later.  If the 
  6685	   remote modem doesn't have handset exclusion, you can try to switch back 
  6686	   to voice later.  Or, you both can hang up your phones as soon as the 
  6687	   modems go off hook.  
  6688	
  6689	***************************
  6690	Software Commands--ATD, ATA
  6691	If your voice/data switch is set for a function other than voice/data 
  6692	operations and you don't wish to change it, use AT commands.  
  6693	
  6694	1. Call the other user to establish the bit rate, parity, word length and 
  6695	   number of Stop bits the other person's modem accepts.  Determine which 
  6696	   modem will originate and which will answer.
  6697	
  6698	2. If you are to originate the connection, type the following command:
  6699	
  6700	          ATD <Enter>
  6701	 
  6702	   NOTE:  Be sure the modem is not set to X2, X4, X6 or X7, or it will 
  6703	   return the NO DIAL TONE result code and hang up.
  6704	
  6705	3. The other party must then have the remote modem go off hook in Answer 
  6706	   mode.  The following command is used to do this:
  6707	
  6708	           ATA <Enter>
  6709	
  6710	4. If the remote modem also has handset exclusion, leave both phones off 
  6711	   hook in case you wish to switch back again to voice after your data 
  6712	   transfer.  If the remote modem doesn't have handset exclusion, switching 
  6713	   back to voice may not be successful.  If you don't want to switch back 
  6714	   to voice later, hang up both phones as soon as the modems go off hook.

  6718	ALLOWABLE VOICE/DATA AWITCH FUNCTIONS
  6719	
  6720	Use Register S32 to set the voice/data switch for the function you desire.  
  6721	The default is S32=1--pressing the switch forces the modem off hook in 
  6722	Originate mode.  Pressing the switch when you power on the modem causes 
  6723	it to perform a power-on self-test.  See Table G.1--S32 Functions below.
  6724	
  6725	NOTE:  Some of the applications listed below require some sort of 
  6726	preconfiguration.  Review the Chapter/Appendix referenced before using

  6764	HEWLETT PACKARD INSTALLATIONS
  6765	
  6766	During error control connections, the Courier recognizes the ASCII ENQ/ACK 
  6767	characters exchanged between many Hewlett Packard host computers and their 
  6768	terminals.  The HP host sends the terminal an ENQ character at predefined 
  6769	intervals, and sends no more data until the terminal responds with an ACK 
  6770	character.
  6771	
  6772	Courier modems manage this ENQ/ACK protocol so that communication is 
  6773	speeded up, thereby enabling HP terminals to achieve high speeds on 
  6774	dial-up lines.  Special flow control settings, using the &I command, 
  6775	are required for HP users.  These settings apply to ARQ connections only 
  6776	and to Courier modems set to either B0 or B1.  Disregard other Courier 
  6777	flow control commands.
  6778	
  6779	Set the Courier to Host mode if it is attached to the host computer, or 
  6780	to Terminal mode if it is attached to a terminal, as follows:
  6781	
  6782	     Host mode       AT&I3 <Enter>
  6783	     Terminal mode   AT&I4 <Enter>

  6787	MI/MIC OPERATIONS (EXTERNAL MODEMS ONLY)
  6788	
  6789	
  6790	Mode Indicate/Mode Indicate Common (MI/MIC) closure is required by some 
  6791	installations whose existing hardware does the dialing.  The modems do 
  6792	not Auto Dial.
  6793	
  6794	In these situations, the modem must be forced off hook in Originate mode.  
  6795	This is done by shorting (closing) two of the pins (not Tip and Ring) in 
  6796	the phone connector.  The modem is then ready to go online and accept data 
  6797	when it connects with the number dialed by the system equipment.
  6798	
  6799	Courier modems are shipped with MI/MIC disabled, that is, for normal use.  
  6800	To set the modems for MI/MIC closure, you must do two things:  physically 
  6801	set jumpers on the modem’s printed circuit board, and enable bit 5 of 
  6802	Register S34 (ATS34=32 or ATS34.5=1).  We recommend you then write that 
  6803	setting to NVRAM as a power-on default.
  6804	
  6805	Once you've set Register S34, have the system force the modem off hook 
  6806	by closing the MI/MIC leads in the phone line connector.  The modem's OH 
  6807	(Off Hook) status light, or LED, goes on when the modem goes off hook.  
  6808	
  6809	***************************
  6810	SETTIING THE MI/MIC JUMPERS
  6811	You'll have to dismantle the modem case to set the two jumper switches on 
  6812	the printed circuit board, as follows:
  6813	
  6814	1.  Power off the modem and disconnect all of its cables.
  6815	
  6816	2.  Turn the modem upside down.  Remove the two square vinyl feet near 
  6817	    the back of the case, on either side of the bottom label's DIP switch 
  6818	    diagram.  Be careful to put the vinyl feet aside, upside down, where 
  6819	    they won't become stuck to another object.
  6820	
  6821	3.  Remove the two Phillips screws located in the wells beneath the vinyl 
  6822	    feet.  
  6823	
  6824	4.  Gently pry off the plastic volume slide-switch cover.
  6825	
  6826	5.  Raise the back end of the case bottom until it is at about a 60 degree 
  6827	    angle; lift it away from inside the front of the modem.  Put the case 
  6828	    bottom aside.
  6829	
  6830	6.  Locate the voice/data switch at the front of the modem.  Lift up and 
  6831	    remove the modem (printed circuit board), carefully easing the 
  6832	    voice/data switch out of its opening in the front panel.
  6833	
  6834	7.  Turn the modem rightside up and locate jumper switches J4 and J6, 
  6835	
  6836	8.  The jumpers are black shunts that cover two out of three upright metal 
  6837	    contacts.  As shown in the figure, set the jumpers so they cover the 
  6838	    two contacts on each switch that are closest to the front panel.  The 
  6839	    third contact on each switch is exposed.
  6840	
  6841	9.  Replace the modem in the case top:  ease the voice/data switch into 
  6842	    the opening in the front panel and make sure the back of the board 
  6843	    rests on the locator pins at the rear (from which you removed the 
  6844	    screws).
  6845	
  6846	10. Connect the modem's RS-232, power and phone cables, in that order 
  6847	    (see Chapter 2).  Be sure the phone cable is plugged into the jack 
  6848	    closest to the center of the modem--the jack represented by the wall 
  6849	    jack icon on the case bottom label.  
  6850	   
  6851	    CAUTION:  When you power on the modem there will be potentially 
  6852	    hazardous voltage, particularly near the phone jacks.  Do not touch 
  6853	    the board when the power is on.
  6854	
  6855	11. Power on the modem.  Try MI/MIC closure.  Check to see that the Off 
  6856	    Hook (OH) status light goes on.  If you dialed a number, listen for 
  6857	    an answer tone from the remote modem.  Then drop the DTR signal.  The 
  6858	    modem should go on hook and the OH status light should go off.  
  6859	
  6860	12. When you are sure the equipment is working correctly, disconnect the 
  6861	    modem's RS-232, power and phone cables, and replace the bottom of the 
  6862	    modem case.  Ease the two nibs near the front corners into their 
  6863	    openings in the front of the case top, guide the rectangular slot 
  6864	    over the volume switch, and ease the back of the case bottom into 
  6865	    place.  Replace the two screws, the two vinyl feet, and the volume 
  6866	    slide-switch cover.  
  6867	    
  6868	***************
  6869	TROUBLESHOOTING
  6870	
  6871	You may find that the modem does not respond to MI/MIC closure, which you 
  6872	can monitor by observing the LED.  Or the modem may fail to go back on hook 
  6873	when the computer or terminal drops the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal.  
  6874	The probable reason for either of these conditions is that your phone 
  6875	equipment reverses MI/MIC polarity.  
  6876	
  6877	It's possible to solve this problem by reversing the modem's MI/MIC wiring.  
  6878	You'll have to dismantle the modem case again and reset the two jumper 
  6879	switches on the printed circuit board, as follows:
  6880	
  6881	1. Lift off the jumpers from J4 and J6.  Reverse the positions.  That is, 
  6882	   on each switch, cover the center and rightmost contacts.  Make sure 
  6883	   the jumpers cover two contacts on each switch, or you'll disable the 
  6884	   MI/MIC function.
  6885	
  6886	2. Replace the modem in the case top:  ease the voice/data switch into 
  6887	   the opening in the front panel and make sure the back of the board
  6888	   rests on the locator pins at the rear (from which you removed the 
  6889	   screws).
  6890	
  6891	3. Reconnect the modem's RS-232, power and phone cables, in that order.  
  6892	   Be sure the phone cable is plugged into the jack closest to the center 
  6893	   of the modem--the jack represented by the wall jack icon on the case 
  6894	   bottom label.  
  6895	   
  6896	   CAUTION:  When you power on the modem there will be potentially 
  6897	   hazardous voltage, particularly near the phone jacks.  Do not touch 
  6898	   the board when the power is on.
  6899	
  6900	4. Power on the modem.  Try MI/MIC closure again.  Check to see that the 
  6901	   Off Hook (OH) status light goes on.  If you dialed a number, listen for 
  6902	   an answer tone from the remote modem.  Then drop the DTR signal.  The 
  6903	   modem should go on hook and the OH status light should go off.  
  6904	
  6905	5. If closure is not working properly, review the steps in this section.  
  6906	   Be sure the jumper switches are in the correct positions.  If you still 
  6907	   have problems, there may be a problem with the phone cable.  Or there 
  6908	   may be a problem with your hardware.
  6909	
  6910	6. When the equipment is working correctly, disconnect the modem's 
  6911	   RS-232, power and phone cables, and replace the bottom of the modem 
  6912	   case.  Ease the two nibs near the front corners into their openings 
  6913	   in the front of the case top, guide the rectangular slot over the 
  6914	   volume switch, and ease the back of the case bottom into place.  
  6915	   Replace the two screws, the two vinyl feet, and the volume slide-switch 
  6916	   cover.

  6918	
  6919	Appendix H--Modem Testing
  6920	
  6921	Testing is available with the &T command or Register S16.  All loopback 
  6922	testing conforms to ITU-T Recommendation V.54.  Earlier U.S. Robotics high 
  6923	speed modems, however, did not perform the &T test repertoire.  
  6924	
  6925	Only one test can be performed at a given time.  If you send a test 
  6926	command while the modem is in test mode, you'll receive an ERROR message. 
  6927	
  6928	NOTE:  Testing is not available when the modem is in synchronous mode:  
  6929	&M1, &M6, &M7.
  6930	
  6931	
  6932	***************
  6933	Testing With &T
  6934	The tests supported through the &T command include analog loopback, digital 
  6935	loopback and remote digital loopback.  Users can key in their own data 
  6936	during testing, or use the modem's internal test pattern and error detector.  
  6937	In all cases, disable error control before testing.  If the modem is 
  6938	detecting errors and retransmitting the affected data, your results will 
  6939	be invalid.
  6940	
  6941	During testing, the MR status light flashes.  
  6942	
  6943	***********************
  6944	Ending a Test--&T0, S18
  6945	Issuing the &T0 command terminates a test.  Alternatively, set Register 
  6946	S18 to a specified number of seconds, for example, S18=10.  When the 10 
  6947	seconds are up, the modem automatically ends the test and returns to 
  6948	Command mode.  If the test was Analog Loopback, the &T0 command hangs up 
  6949	the modem.  If the test was Digital or Remote Digital Loopback, issue an 
  6950	ATH command to hang up the modem, or an ATZ command to hang up the modem 
  6951	and reset it to its defaults.
  6952	
  6953	NOTE:  If you use the S18 test timer, but in the process of testing you 
  6954	issue an ATZ command, S18 resets to zero and the timer is disabled.  You cannot store a value for S18 in nonvolatile memory;  its power-on and reset default is always zero.
  6955	
  6956	*************************
  6957	Analog Loopback--&T1, &T8
  6958	This test checks the operation of the modem's transmitter and receiver.  
  6959	
  6960	There are two analog loopback options.  The first, &T1, involves your 
  6961	typing data that you can verify at your screen.  
  6962	
  6963	The second option, &T8, is an internal self-test that does not involve 
  6964	the keyboard or screen.  It isolates the modem from the computer 
  6965	interface to give you a more specific result. 
  6966	
  6967	NOTE:  Dual Standard modems must be set to B0 (default) or tested at 
  6968	2400 bps or lower to avoid HST asymmetrical modulation at higher speeds.
  6969	
  6970	***
  6971	&T1
  6972	1. If you are testing an HST or Dual Standard modem, set your terminal or 
  6973	   software to 2400 bps.
  6974	
  6975	2. The modem must be in Command mode.  If you wish, set Register S18 as a 
  6976	   test timer, as explained earlier. 
  6977	
  6978	3. Send the modem the following command:
  6979	   
  6980	           AT &M0 &T1 <Enter>
  6981	
  6982	   The modem disables error control, enters analog loopback (AL) mode, and 
  6983	   sends a CONNECT message.  The MR status light flashes. 
  6984	
  6985	4. Type recognizable data so that you can verify it when it is looped back 
  6986	   to the screen.
  6987	
  6988	5. End the test.  If you set S18, the modem automatically stops the test 
  6989	   at the timeout, exits AL mode and responds OK.
  6990	
  6991	   If you didn't set Register S18, wait one second and type +++ to bring the 
  6992	   modem back to Command mode.  If DIP switch 9 is OFF, the modem also 
  6993	   hangs up and ends the test.   
  6994	   
  6995	   If DIP switch 9 is ON, type AT&T0 to end the test.  Or send either ATH 
  6996	   or the command that resets the modem, ATZ.  The latter two commands end 
  6997	   the test and hang up the modem.  The modem responds OK.  If the modem 
  6998	   sends an ERROR message, you have issued an invalid command.
  6999	
  7000	6. If there were no errors, reset the modem to &M4, for error control, 
  7001	   unless you've issued the ATZ reset command. 
  7002	
  7003	   NOTE:  If the modem is in online-command mode, that is, still connected 
  7004	   to a remote modem, and you send it an &T1 or &T8 command, it drops the 
  7005	   call, enters AL mode, sends a CONNECT result and waits for loopback 
  7006	   characters.
  7007	
  7008	
  7009	***
  7010	&T8
  7011	This AL option causes the modem to send an internal test pattern to its 
  7012	transmitter and loop it back to the receiver.  An internal error detector 
  7013	counts any errors and, when the test is ended, sends the number of errors 
  7014	or 000 (no errors) to the screen.
  7015	
  7016	Since you don't type anything during this test, and the modem does not send 
  7017	anything to the screen, this option verifies only the modem.  If there are 
  7018	no errors but your problem continues, it may be at the computer interface.
  7019	
  7020	1. If you are testing an HST or Dual Standard modem, set your terminal 
  7021	   or software to 2400 bps.
  7022	
  7023	2. The modem must be in Command mode.  If you wish, set Register S18 as a 
  7024	   test timer, as explained earlier. 
  7025	
  7026	3. Send the modem the following command:  
  7027	
  7028	        AT &M0 &T8 <Enter>
  7029	
  7030	   The modem disables error control and enters AL mode.  The MR status 
  7031	   light flashes.  The modem sends its internal test pattern to the 
  7032	   transmitter, and loops the pattern back to the receiver.  You will 
  7033	   not see any data on your screen.  
  7034	   
  7035	4. End the test.  If you set S18, the modem automatically stops the test 
  7036	   at the timeout.  If you didn't set Register S18, type AT&T0 to end the 
  7037	   test.  Or use ATH or the command that resets the modem, ATZ.  Both of 
  7038	   the latter end the test and hang up the modem.
  7039	
  7040	   The modem hangs up and returns a three-digit code, followed by OK.  A 
  7041	   code of 000 indicates no errors were found.  A code of 255 indicates 
  7042	   255 or more errors.  An ERROR message indicates that you issued an 
  7043	   invalid command.
  7044	
  7045	5. If there were no errors, reset the modem to &M4 for error control 
  7046	   unless you issued the ATZ command.
  7047

  7049	&T2
  7050	This option is reserved. 
  7051	
  7052	*********************
  7053	Digital Loopback--&T3
  7054	If your modem has passed the AL test, this test can help you locate 
  7055	a problem with a remote modem or the telephone channel.  
  7056	
  7057	NOTE:  This test requires the modem to establish a connection and return 
  7058	to online-command mode in response to the +++ escape code.  DIP switch 9 
  7059	must be set ON so that the modem does not hang up on receipt of the escape 
  7060	code.  After you change the switch, issue ATZ to the modem to initiate 
  7061	the new setting.
  7062	
  7063	As with AL testing, HST and Dual Standard modems should be tested at 
  7064	2400 bps or lower.
  7065	
  7066	1. Set the modem to &M0, to disable error control.  HST and Dual Standard 
  7067	   modems should be set to 2400 bps or lower to avoid asymmetrical 
  7068	   modulation at higher speeds.  Establish a connection with the remote 
  7069	   modem.
  7070	
  7071	2. Bring the modem back to Command mode with the +++ escape code.  Then 
  7072	   send it the AT&T3 command.  The modem enters DL mode and the MR 
  7073	   status light flashes.
  7074	
  7075	3. The remote user should type a short message.  It will be looped back 
  7076	   by your modem's transmitter for verification on the remote screen.  
  7077	   You will not see the message or any other data.
  7078	
  7079	4. When the remote user has completed the test, issue the AT&T0 command 
  7080	   to end the test.  Or send either ATH or the command that resets the 
  7081	   modem, ATZ.  The latter two commands end the test and hang up the 
  7082	   modem.  The modem responds OK.  If the modem sends an ERROR message, 
  7083	   you have issued an invalid command.

  7085	5. Reset DIP switch 9 OFF if you normally use the factory default.  Reset 
  7086	   the modem to &M4 unless you used the reset command, ATZ.  
  7087	
  7088	
  7089	********
  7090	&T4, &T5
  7091	The &T4 option causes the modem to grant a remote modem's request for a 
  7092	Remote Digital Loopback test.  
  7093	
  7094	The &T5 option cancels &T4, and the modem fails to recognize such a 
  7095	request.  This is the default so that your modem isn't subject to 
  7096	another user calling and tying up your modem without your permission.
  7097	
  7098	*********************************
  7099	Remote Digital Loopback--&T6, &T7
  7100	This test, like the local digital loopback test, verifies the condition of 
  7101	both modems and the phone link. 
  7102	
  7103	The request for and granting of Remote Digital Loopback testing requires 
  7104	that both modems use ITU-T V.22 standard signaling.  The test must be 
  7105	performed at 2400 bps or lower.  If the remote modem does not have the 
  7106	capability or is not set to respond (&T4), you will get an ERROR result 
  7107	code.
  7108	
  7109	As with Analog Loopback, there are two Remote Digital Loopback options.  
  7110	If you select &T6, you send keyboard data to the modem and verify it 
  7111	when it is returned over the phone lines and to your screen.  If you 
  7112	select &T7, the modem sends its internal test pattern and returns an 
  7113	error count to your screen.  
  7114	
  7115	NOTE:  Both test options require the modem to establish a connection and 
  7116	return to online-command mode in response to the +++ escape code.  DIP 
  7117	switch 9 must be set ON so that the modem does not hang up on receipt 
  7118	of the escape code.  If necessary, set the switch ON and then issue the 
  7119	ATZ command to the modem to initiate the new switch setting.
  7120	
  7121	***
  7122	&T6
  7123	1. Set the software to 2400 bps or lower.  Set the modem to &M0.  If you 
  7124	   wish, set the S18 timer.  
  7125	
  7126	   Establish a connection with the remote modem.  If you haven't already 
  7127	   done so, arrange with the remote user to cooperate with your testing 
  7128	   and, if necessary, set the remote modem to acknowledge the RDL request.  
  7129	   For example, older U.S. Robotics high speed modems need to be set to 
  7130	   S16=8.
  7131	
  7132	2. Bring the Modem back to Command mode with the +++ escape code.  Send it 
  7133	   the AT&T6 command.  The modem enters RDL mode and the MR status light 
  7134	   flashes.
  7135	
  7136	3. Type a short message.  It will be looped back to your modem by the 
  7137	   remote modem and to your screen for verification.  (The remote user 
  7138	   will not see your data.)
  7139	
  7140	4. End the test.  If you set Register S18 the modem automatically ends the 
  7141	   test when the test timeout is reached.  If you didn't set S18, type AT&T0 
  7142	   to end the test.  Or send either ATH or the command that resets the modem, 
  7143	   ATZ.  The latter two commands end the test and hang up the modem.  The 
  7144	   modem responds OK.  If you issue an invalid command, the modem sends an 
  7145	   ERROR message.
  7146	
  7147	   Data errors indicate a problem with the remote modem or the phone link.  
  7148	   If you have not performed analog loopback testing with your modem, the 
  7149	   problem may also lie with your modem.
  7150	
  7151	5. Reset DIP switch 9 OFF unless you normally set that switch ON, and issue 
  7152	   ATZ to the modem to initiate the new setting.  Reset the modem to &M4 
  7153	   unless you used the reset command, ATZ.  
  7154	
  7155	***
  7156	&T7
  7157	This test option causes the modem to send an internal test pattern through 
  7158	the Remote Digital Loopback.  An internal error detector counts any errors 
  7159	and, when the test is ended, sends the number of errors or 000 (no errors) 
  7160	to the screen.
  7161	
  7162	You don't need to type anything during this test.  The modem sends only 
  7163	its final error count to your screen.
  7164	
  7165	1. Set the software to 2400 bps or lower.  Set the modem to &M0.  If you 
  7166	   wish, set the S18 timer.
  7167	
  7168	   Establish a connection with the remote modem.  If you haven't already 
  7169	   done so, arrange with the remote user to cooperate with your testing 
  7170	   and, if necessary, set the remote modem to acknowledge the RDL 
  7171	   request.  For example, older U.S. Robotics high speed modems need to 
  7172	   be set to S16=8. 
  7173	
  7174	2. Bring the modem back to Command mode with the +++ escape code.  Then 
  7175	   send it the AT&T7 command.  The modem enters RDL mode and the MR 
  7176	   status light flashes.  
  7177	
  7178	   The modem sends its internal test pattern to the remote modem, which 
  7179	   loops it back to your modem.  You will not see the data on your screen.
  7180	
  7181	3. End the test.  If you set S18, the modem automatically stops the test 
  7182	   when the timer times out.  If you didn't set Register S18, type AT&T0 
  7183	   to end the test.  Or send either ATH or the command that resets the 
  7184	   modem, ATZ.  The latter two commands end the test and hang up the modem.  
  7185	   The modem responds OK.  If you issue an invalid command, the modem 
  7186	   sends an ERROR message.
  7187	
  7188	   When you terminate the test, the modem returns a three-digit code, 
  7189	   followed by OK.  A code of 000 indicates no errors were found.  A code 
  7190	   of 255 indicates 255 or more errors.  
  7191	   
  7192	   If you've performed an Analog Loopback and know your modem is working 
  7193	   properly, errors indicate a problem with either the phone connection 
  7194	   or the remote modem.
  7195	
  7196	4. Reset DIP switch 9 OFF unless you normally operate with it ON.  Issue 
  7197	   an ATZ command to initiate the new switch setting.  Reset the modem to 
  7198	   &M4 unless you've sent it the ATZ reset command.  
  7199	
  7200	
  7201	*************************
  7202	TESTING WITH REGISTER S16
  7203	
  7204	Register S16 is a bit-mapped register with the following bit functions:
  7205	
  7206	        Bit     Value   Function
  7207	        0       1       Analog Loopback (AL)
  7208	        1       2       Dial Test
  7209	        2       4       Test Pattern
  7210	        3       8       Remote Digital Loopback (RDL)
  7211	
  7212	NOTE:  Earlier U.S. Robotics modems require bit 3 to be enabled in order 
  7213	to grant RDL to a remote modem.  The modem now requires its default &T4 
  7214	setting instead.  To perform RDL with a U.S. Robotics modem that does 
  7215	not use the &T test repertoire, that modem should be set to S16=8 before 
  7216	it can grant RDL testing.
  7217	
  7218	****************************
  7219	Analog Loopback (AL)--S16=1D
  7220	As with the &T AL test, do not attempt this test under error control.  HST 
  7221	and Dual Standard modems should be tested at 2400 bps or lower, to avoid 
  7222	asymmetrical modulation at higher speeds. 
  7223	
  7224	To use the modem's Test Pattern (S16, bit 2) instead of typing your own 
  7225	data, see Test Pattern--S16=4 later in this appendix.
  7226	
  7227	1. To initiate testing, type AT&M0S16=1D.  The modem disables error control, 
  7228	   enters AL mode and sends a CONNECT result code.  The MR status light 
  7229	   flashes.
  7230	
  7231	2. Type data to the modem for the modem to transmit, loop to its receiver, 
  7232	   and output to the screen.  An alternative is to use the Test Pattern, 
  7233	   described later. 
  7234	
  7235	3. End the test by not typing anything for one second, then typing three 
  7236	   pluses (+++), and waiting another second.  This forces the modem back
  7237	   to Command mode.  If DIP switch 9 is OFF, the modem exits AL mode and 
  7238	   returns to Command mode.  If DIP switch 9 is ON, the modem maintains 
  7239	   the connection when it receives the +++ escape code.  Issue the ATH 
  7240	   command to end AL mode.  
  7241	
  7242	4. Reset the modem to Data mode, S16=0, and error control (&M4), or issue 
  7243	   the ATZ (reset) command.
  7244	
  7245	
  7246	****************
  7247	Dial Test--S16=2
  7248	The Dial Test is used for factory testing the frequencies of tone values.  
  7249	When S-Register 16 is set to 2 and a single tone is dialed (e.g., ATD7 
  7250	<Enter>), the modem continues to transmit that tone until you type another 
  7251	Carriage Return.
  7252	
  7253	
  7254	*******************
  7255	Test Pattern--S16=4
  7256	The test pattern can be used instead of your typed data during Analog 
  7257	Loopback (AL) or Remote Digital Loopback (RDL), using &T commands or S16.  
  7258	The test pattern is available at all speeds.  At 300 bps, the modem's 
  7259	serial port rate must be fixed (&B1) and the link rate fixed at 300 bps 
  7260	(&N1).  At rates over 9600 bps, just set the modem for a fixed serial 
  7261	port rate (&B1).
  7262	
  7263	To use the test pattern during AL testing with S16, type the following 
  7264	command.  The test pattern is sent through the loopback.
  7265	
  7266	           AT&M0S16=5D
  7267	
  7268	To use the test pattern during RDL testing with S16, type the following 
  7269	command: 
  7270	
  7271	           AT&M0S16=12 
  7272	
  7273	To use the test pattern with the &T AL or RDL tests, insert the test 
  7274	pattern command, S16=4, before issuing the test command.  The first of 
  7275	the following commands initiates AL, the second RDL: 
  7276	
  7277	           ATS16=4&T1
  7278	           ATS16=4&T6
  7279	
  7280	The test pattern alone (ATS16=4) is used for testing equipment and the 
  7281	phone line.  When S16 is set to 4, the modem transmits the test pattern 
  7282	upon connection with a remote modem.  
  7283	
  7284	
  7285	Ending Testing with the Test Pattern
  7286	Pressing any character key cancels all test pattern tests and hangs up the 
  7287	modem.  If you used Register S16, be sure to reset Register S16 to Data 
  7288	mode when you reset the modem to its error control defaults, for example, 
  7289	ATZ or AT&M4S16=0.  
  7290	
  7291	******************************
  7292	Remote Digital Loopback--S16=8
  7293	
  7294	Responding Modem 
  7295	The responding modem must be ready to act on the Courier's RDL request.  
  7296	U.S. Robotics high speed modems should be set to &T4.  If they do not 
  7297	have &T testing capability, they should be set to S16=8.
  7298	
  7299	Initiating Modem
  7300	1. If DIP switch 9 is OFF, set it ON so that it does not hang up on 
  7301	   receipt of the +++ escape code.  Issue an ATZ command to initiate the 
  7302	   new switch setting.
  7303	
  7304	2. Set the software to 2400 or 1200 bps.  The ITU-T-specified RDL signals 
  7305	   are defined only for connections at 2400 or 1200 bps.
  7306	
  7307	3. Disable error control by setting the modem to &M0.  Then establish a 
  7308	   connection with the remote modem.
  7309	
  7310	4. Bring the modem back to Command mode by sending it the escape code:  
  7311	   one second of no data, three pluses (+++), and another second of no 
  7312	   data.
  7313	
  7314	5. When the OK result code appears, send the modem the following command:
  7315	
  7316	           ATS16=8 O
  7317	
  7318	   The modem enters RDL mode (S16=8), the MR status light flashes, and the 
  7319	   modem goes back online (O command).  Then it transmits the ITU-T-defined 
  7320	   RDL signals, causing the remote modem to enter RDL mode.
  7321	
  7322	6. Type any data at the keyboard.  (Or send the test pattern.)
  7323	
  7324	7. To end the test, send the modem the +++ escape code again to bring it 
  7325	   back to Command mode.  
  7326	
  7327	8. When the modem sends the OK result, reset the modem to Data mode with 
  7328	   the following command:
  7329	
  7330	          ATS16=0
  7331	 
  7332	   The modem signals the responding modem that RDL testing is over.  
  7333	   Terminate the call as you normally would, and reset the modem to its 
  7334	   normal error control setting, &M4 or &M5.
  7335	
  7336	   Or, if you wish to resume data transmission with the remote modem, add 
  7337	   the O command to the ATS16=0 string to return the modem online.  Keep in 
  7338	   mind, however, that error control is disabled.  Because error control 
  7339	   is negotiated during the connection sequence, its status cannot be 
  7340	   changed until the modem is back on hook and in Command mode.

  7393	Upgrade your Modem
  7394	NOTE:  Your modem must be turned on for the following operation.
  7395	
  7396	1. At the DOS prompt of the directory where your copy of the file has been 
  7397	   downloaded, type USRSDL and press Enter.  The zipped file will 
  7398	   self-extract several files onto your computer hard disk.
  7399	
  7400	2. Type SDL and press Enter.
  7401	   The .EXE file checks the code embedded in itself.  If there is a problem, 
  7402	   an error message appears and the operation is terminated.  If you receive 
  7403	   an error message, download the file again. 
  7404	
  7405	3. A screen appears with default COM port information.  
  7406	
  7407	   If you want to alter the defaults, use the guidelines below.  
  7408	   
  7409	   /c=n    Enter this command to select one of four predefined COM ports 
  7410	           on an IBM-compatible PC.  Valid entries for n are 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
  7411	           The default is COM 2.  If you change the COM port setting, a 
  7412	           compatible IRQ will be displayed.
  7413	   
  7414	   /i=n    Enter this command to set up a custom port.  It specifies which 
  7415	           IRQ (interrupt request) the COM port will use to interrupt the 
  7416	           processor for service.  Valid entries for n are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7.  
  7417	           The default is IRQ 3.
  7418	   
  7419	   /a=n    Enter this command to specify a port address, where n is the 
  7420	           hexadecimal address of a custom port only.
  7421	   
  7422	   /b=n    Enter this command to specify the bit rate at which the COM 
  7423	           port will communicate with the modem.  Valid entries for n are 
  7424	           9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200.  The default is 57600 bps.
  7425	   
  7426	   /q      This command allows you to shut off most of the screen display 
  7427	           as the program upgrades your modem code for batch-mode execution.  
  7428	           You will not be prompted to accept settings.
  7429	   
  7430	   /?      This command displays a help screen.
  7431	
  7432	4. A prompt asks if you want to "Download Using These Settings? (Y/N)."  
  7433	   Type Y if you want to continue.  Type N if you want to abort the 
  7434	   operation.
  7435	
  7436	   NOTE:  This is the only opportunity you will have to abort the operation.
  7437	
  7438	5. Once you have accepted the settings, the software download will begin.  
  7439	   During this operation, the Modem Ready (MR) LED goes out.  
  7440	
  7441	6. When the operation has successfully completed, the "Modem reports 
  7442	   download successful" message displays and the MR LED lights up again.
  7443	
  7444	***************
  7445	Troubleshooting
  7446	If your modem indicates an error, try running the SDL program at a lower 
  7447	serial port rate.  If your computer doesn’t have a 16550 UART, a slower 
  7448	serial port rate can make all the difference.
  7449	
  7450	You can also try running the program on a different PC.  An idiosyncracy 
  7451	of an off-brand PC or an uncommon version of DOS my hang up the SDL program.

  7459	Adaptive Speed Leveling (ASL)
  7460	   Courier V.32 bis and V.32 terbo modems detect improved line conditions 
  7461	   and shift upward again to the next higher speed.  The modems at both 
  7462	   ends of the connection adapt independently, each detecting and adjusting 
  7463	   to line conditions.  ASL keeps the modems online, always operating at 
  7464	   the highest possible speed, and constantly ensuring data integrity.

  7488	   which feature error detection and automatic retransmission of defective 
  7489	   blocks of data.  See HST, MNP, and V.42.
  7490	
  7491	ASCII
  7492	   American Standard Code for Information Interchange.  A 7-bit binary code 
  7493	   (0's, 1's) used to represent letters, numbers, and special characters 
  7494	   such as $, !, and /.  Supported by almost every computer and terminal 
  7495	   manufacturer.  
  7496	
  7497	Asymmetrical Modulation
  7498	   A duplex transmission technique which splits the communications channel 
  7499	   into one high speed channel and one slower channel.  During a call under 
  7500	   asymmetrical modulation, the modem with the greatest amount of data to 
  7501	   transmit is allocated the high speed channel.  The modem with less data 
  7502	   is allocated the slow, or back channel (450 bps).  The modems dynamically 
  7503	   reverse the channels during a call if the volume of data transfer changes.  
  7504	
  7505	Asynchronous Transmission
  7506	   Data transmission in which the length of time between transmitted 
  7507	   characters may vary.  
  7508	   
  7509	   Because the time lapses between transmitted characters are not uniform, 
  7510	   the receiving modem must be signaled as to when the data bits of a 
  7511	   character begin and when they end.  The addition of Start and Stop bits 
  7512	   to each character serves this purpose.
  7513	
  7514	Auto Answer 
  7515	   A feature in modems enabling them to answer incoming calls over the phone 
  7516	   lines without the use of a telephone receiver.
  7517	
  7518	Auto Dial
  7519	   A feature in modems enabling them to dial phone numbers over the phone 
  7520	   system without the use of a telephone transmitter.
  7521	
  7522	Baud Rate
  7523	   The number of discrete signal events per second occurring on a 
  7524	   communications channel.  Although not technically accurate, baud rate is commonly used to mean bit rate.
  7525	
  7526	Binary Digit
  7527	   A 0 or 1, reflecting the use of a binary numbering system (only two 
  7528	   digits).  Used because the computer recognizes either of two states, 
  7529	   OFF or ON.  Shortened form of binary digit is bit.  
  7530	
  7531	Bisync
  7532	   Binary Synchronous Control.  An earlier protocol developed by IBM for 
  7533	   software applications and communicating devices operating in synchronous 
  7534	   environments.  The protocol defines operations at the link level of 
  7535	   communications, for example, the format of data frames exchanged between 
  7536	   modems over a phone line.  See Protocol, HDLC, SDLC.
  7537	
  7538	Bit Rate
  7539	   The number of binary digits, or bits, transmitted per second (bps). 
  7540	   Communications channels using telephone channel modems are established 
  7541	   at set bit rates, commonly 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, and 14400.
  7542	
  7543	BPS
  7544	   The bits (binary digits) per second rate.
  7545	
  7546	Buffer
  7547	   A memory area used as temporary storage during input and output 
  7548	   operations.  An example is the modem's command buffer.   Another is the 
  7549	   Transmit Data flow control buffer used for flow control and to store 
  7550	   copies of transmitted frames until they are positively acknowledged by 
  7551	   the receiving modem.
  7552	
  7553	Byte
  7554	   A group of binary digits stored and operated upon as a unit.  A byte may 
  7555	   have a coded value equal to a character in the ASCII code (letters, 
  7556	   numbers), or have some other value meaningful to the computer.  In 
  7557	   user documentation, the term usually refers to 8-bit units or characters.  
  7558	   1 kilobyte (K) is equal to 1,024 bytes or characters; 64K indicates 
  7559	   65,536 bytes or characters. 
  7560	
  7561	Call Indicate
  7562	   A call originating tone defined by ITU-T recommendation V.8.
  7563	
  7564	Carrier
  7565	   A continuous frequency capable of being either modulated or impressed 
  7566	   with another information-carrying signal.  Carriers are  generated and 
  7567	   maintained by modems via the transmission lines of the telephone 
  7568	   companies.  
  7569	
  7570	CCITT
  7571	   Formerly, an international organization that defined standards for 
  7572	   telegraphic and telephone equipment.  It has been incorporated into 
  7573	   its parent organization, International Telecommunication Union (ITU).  
  7574	   Telecommunication standards are now covered under Telecommunications 
  7575	   Standards Sector (TSS).  ITU-T replaces CCITT.  For example, the 
  7576	   Bell 212A standard for 1200 bps communication in North America was 
  7577	   referred to as CCITT V.22.  It is now referred to as ITU-T V.22.
  7578	
  7579	Character
  7580	   A representation, coded in binary digits, of a letter, number, or other 
  7581	   symbol.  
  7582	
  7583	Characters Per Second
  7584	   A data transfer rate generally estimated from the bit rate and the 
  7585	   character length.  
  7586	   
  7587	   For example, at 2400 bps, 8-bit characters with Start and Stop bits 
  7588	   (for a total of ten bits per character) will be transmitted at a rate 
  7589	   of approximately 240 characters per second (cps).  Some protocols, 
  7590	   such as USR-HST and MNP, employ advanced techniques such as longer 
  7591	   transmission frames and data compression to increase cps.
  7592	
  7593	Class 1/EIA-578
  7594	   An American standard used between facsimile application programs and 
  7595	   facsimile modems for sending and receiving Class 1 faxes.
  7596	
  7597	Class 2.0/EIA-592
  7598	   An American standard used between facsimile application programs and 
  7599	   facsimile modems for sending and receiving Class 2.0 faxes.
  7600	
  7601	Cyclic Redundancy Checking (CRC)
  7602	   An error-detection technique consisting of a cyclic algorithm performed 
  7603	   on each block or frame of data by both sending and receiving modems.  
  7604	   The sending modem inserts the results of its computation in each data 
  7605	   block in the form of a CRC code.  The receiving modem compares its 
  7606	   results with the received CRC code and responds with either a positive 
  7607	   or negative acknowledgment.  In the ARQ protocol implemented in U.S. 
  7608	   Robotics high speed modems, the receiving modem accepts no more data 
  7609	   until a defective block is received correctly.
  7610	
  7611	Data Communications
  7612	   A type of communications in which computers and terminals are able to 
  7613	   exchange data over an electronic medium.  
  7614	
  7615	Data Compression
  7616	   When the transmitting modem detects redundant units of data, it recodes 
  7617	   them into shorter units of fewer bits.  The receiving modem then 
  7618	   decompresses the redundant data units before passing them to the 
  7619	   receiving computer.
  7620	
  7621	Data Compression Table
  7622	   A table of values assigned for each character during a call under data 
  7623	   compression.  Default values in the table are continually altered and 
  7624	   built during each call:  the longer the table, the more efficient 
  7625	   throughput gained.
  7626	
  7627	   If a destructive Break is sent during a call (see the &Y command), 
  7628	   causing the modems to reset the compression tables, you can expect 
  7629	   diminished throughput.
  7630	
  7631	Data Mode
  7632	   The mode in which the fax modem is capable of sending and receiving 
  7633	   data files.  A standard modem without fax capabilities is always in 
  7634	   Data mode.
  7635	
  7636	DCE
  7637	   Data Communication (or Circuit-Terminating) Equipment.  In this manual, 
  7638	   the term applies to dial-up modems that establish and control the data 
  7639	   link via the telephone network.
  7640	
  7641	Dedicated Line
  7642	   A user-installed telephone line used to connect a specified number of 
  7643	   computers or terminals within a limited area, for example, one building.  
  7644	   The line is a cable rather than a public-access telephone line.  The 
  7645	   communications channel may also be referred to as nonswitched because 
  7646	   calls do not go through telephone company switching equipment.
  7647	
  7648	Default
  7649	   Any setting assumed, at startup or reset, by the computer's software 
  7650	   and attached devices, and operational until changed by the user.  
  7651	
  7652	Digital Loopback
  7653	   A test that checks the modem's RS-232 interface and the cable that 
  7654	   connects the terminal or computer and the modem.  The modem receives 
  7655	   data (in the form of digital signals) from the computer or terminal, 
  7656	   and immediately returns the data to the screen for verification.
  7657	
  7658	Digital Signals
  7659	   Discrete, uniform signals.  In this manual, the term refers to the 
  7660	   binary digits 0 and 1. 
  7661	
  7662	Duplex
  7663	   Indicates a communications channel capable of carrying signals in both 
  7664	   directions. See Half Duplex, Full Duplex.
  7665	
  7666	EIA
  7667	   Electronic Industries Association, which defines electronic standards in 
  7668	   the U.S. 
  7669	
  7670	Equalization
  7671	   A compensation circuit designed into modems to counteract certain 
  7672	   distortions introduced by the telephone channel.  Two types are used:  
  7673	   fixed (compromise) equalizers and those that adapt to channel conditions.  
  7674	   U.S. Robotics high speed modems use adaptive equalization.
  7675	
  7676	Error Control 
  7677	   Various techniques which check the reliability of characters (parity) or 
  7678	   blocks of data.  V.42, MNP and HST error control protocols use error 
  7679	   detection (CRC) and retransmission of errored frames (ARQ). 
  7680	
  7681	Facsimile
  7682	   A method for transmitting the image on a printed page from one point to 
  7683	   another.  Commonly referred to as Fax.
  7684	
  7685	Fax Mode
  7686	   The mode in which the fax modem is capable of sending and receiving files 
  7687	   in a facsimile format.  
  7688	
  7689	Flash ROM
  7690	   Read Only Memory that can be erased and reprogrammed. 
  7691	
  7692	Flow Control

  7694	   to and output from a modem or other device. 
  7695	
  7696	Frame
  7697	   A data communications term for a block of data with header and trailer 
  7698	   information attached.  The added information usually includes a frame 
  7699	   number, block size data, error-check codes, and Start/End indicators.
  7700	
  7701	Full Duplex
  7702	   Signal flow in both directions at the same time.  In microcomputer 
  7703	   communications, may refer to the suppression of the online Local Echo.  
  7704	
  7705	Half Duplex
  7706	   Signal flow in both directions, but only one way at a time.  In 
  7707	   microcomputer communications, may refer to activation of the online 
  7708	   Local Echo, which causes the modem to send a copy of the  transmitted 
  7709	   data to the screen of the sending computer.
  7710	
  7711	HDLC
  7712	   High Level Data Link Control.  A standard protocol developed by the 
  7713	   International Standards Organization for software applications and 
  7714	   communicating devices operating in synchronous environments.  The 
  7715	   protocol defines operations at the link level of communications, 
  7716	   for example, the format of data frames exchanged between modems over 
  7717	   a phone line.  See Bisync, Protocol, SDLC.
  7718	
  7719	HST
  7720	   High Speed Technology, U.S. Robotics' proprietary signaling scheme, 
  7721	   design and error control protocol for high-speed modems.  HST 
  7722	   incorporates trellis-coded modulation, for greater immunity from 
  7723	   variable phone line conditions, and asymmetrical modulation for more 
  7724	   efficient use of the phone channel at speeds of 4800 bps and above.  HST 
  7725	   also incorporates MNP-compatible error control procedures adapted to 
  7726	   asymmetrical modulation.
  7727	
  7728	Hz
  7729	   Hertz, a frequency measurement unit used internationally to indicate 
  7730	   one cycle per second.
  7731	
  7732	ITU-T
  7733	   International Telecommunication Union-Telecommunication sector.  
  7734	   Formerly referred to as CCITT.  An international organization that 
  7735	   defines standards for telegraphic and telephone equipment.  For example, 
  7736	   the Bell 212A standard for 1200 bps communication in North America is 
  7737	   observed internationally as ITU-T V.22.  For 2400 bps communication, 
  7738	   most U.S. manufacturers observe V.22 bis.
  7739	
  7740	LAPM 
  7741	   Link Access Procedure for Modems, an error control protocol incorporated 
  7742	   in ITU-T Recommendation V.42.  Like the MNP and HST protocols, LAPM 
  7743	   uses cyclic redundancy checking (CRC) and retransmission of corrupted 
  7744	   data (ARQ) to ensure data reliability.
  7745	
  7746	Local Echo
  7747	   A modem feature that enables the modem to send copies of keyboard 
  7748	   commands and transmitted data to the screen.  When the modem is in 
  7749	   Command mode (not online to another system) the local echo is invoked 
  7750	   through the ATE1 command.  The command causes the modem to display your 
  7751	   typed commands.  When the modem is online to another system, the local 
  7752	   echo is invoked through the ATF0 command.  This command causes the 
  7753	   modem to display the data it transmits to the remote system.
  7754	
  7755	MI/MIC
  7756	   Mode Indicate/Mode Indicate Common, also called Forced or Manual 
  7757	   Originate.  Provided for installations where other equipment, rather 
  7758	   than the modem, does the dialing.  In such installations, the modem 
  7759	   operates in Dumb mode (no Auto Dial capability), yet must go off 
  7760	   hook in Originate mode to connect with answering modems.  See MI/MIC 
  7761	   Closure in Appendix G.
  7762	
  7763	MNP
  7764	   Microcom Networking Protocol, an asynchronous error control protocol 
  7765	   developed by Microcom, Inc. and now in the public domain.  The protocol 
  7766	   ensures error-free transmission through error detection (CRC) and 
  7767	   retransmission of errored frames.  U.S. Robotics modems use MNP 
  7768	   Levels 1-4 and Level 5 data compression.  MNP Levels 1-4 have been 
  7769	   incorporated into ITU-T Recommendation V.42.  Compare HST.
  7770	
  7771	Modem
  7772	   A device that transmits/receives computer data through a communications 
  7773	   channel such as radio or telephone lines.  The Courier is a telephone 
  7774	   channel modem that modulates, or transforms, digital signals from a 
  7775	   computer into the analog form that can be carried successfully on a 
  7776	   phone line.  It also demodulates signals received from the phone line 
  7777	   back to digital signals before passing them to the receiving computer.  
  7778	
  7779	Nonvolatile Memory (NVRAM)
  7780	   User-programmable random access memory whose data is retained when 
  7781	   modem power is turned off.  Used in Courier modems to store a 
  7782	   user-defined default configuration loaded into random access memory 
  7783	   (RAM) at power on.
  7784	
  7785	OFF/ON Hook
  7786	   Modem operations which are the equivalent of manually lifting a 
  7787	   phone receiver (taking it off hook) and replacing it (going on hook).
  7788	   
  7789	Online Fallback
  7790	   A feature that allows high speed error-control modems to monitor line 
  7791	   quality and fall back to the next lower speed if line quality degrades.  
  7792	   The modems fall forward as line quality improves.
  7793	
  7794	Originate Mode
  7795	   A state in which the modem transmits at the predefined low frequency 
  7796	   of the communications channel and receives at the high frequency.  The 
  7797	   transmit/receive frequencies are the reverse of the called modem which 
  7798	   is in Answer mode.  
  7799	
  7800	Parallel Transmission
  7801	   The transfer of data characters using parallel electrical paths for 
  7802	   each bit of the character, for example, 8 paths for 8-bit characters.  
  7803	   Data is stored in computers in parallel form, but may be converted to 
  7804	   serial form for certain operations.  See Serial Transmission.
  7805	
  7806	Parity
  7807	   An error-detection method that checks the validity of a transmitted 
  7808	   character.  Character checking has been surpassed by more reliable 
  7809	   and efficient forms of block-checking, including Xmodem-type protocols 
  7810	   and the ARQ protocol implemented in Courier modems. 
  7811	   
  7812	   The same type of parity must be used by two communicating computers, 
  7813	   or both may omit parity.  When parity is used, a parity bit is added 
  7814	   to each transmitted character.  The bit's value is 0 or 1, to make the 
  7815	   total number of 1's in the character even or odd, depending on which 
  7816	   type of parity is used.
  7817	
  7818	Protocol
  7819	   A system of rules and procedures governing communications between two 
  7820	   or more devices.  Protocols vary, but communicating devices  must 
  7821	   follow the same protocol in order to exchange data.  The format of 
  7822	   the data, readiness to receive or send, error detection and error 
  7823	   correction are some of the operations that may be defined in protocols.  
  7824	   
  7825	RAM
  7826	   Random Access Memory.  Memory that is available for use when the modem 
  7827	   is turned on, but that clears of all information when the power is 
  7828	   turned off.  The modem's RAM holds the current operational settings, 
  7829	   a flow control buffer, and a command buffer. 
  7830	
  7831	Remote Access
  7832	   A feature that allows a remotely-located user to view the Courier's 
  7833	   configuration screens and change the Courier's configuration.  Password 
  7834	   protection is available.
  7835	
  7836	Remote Digital Loopback
  7837	   A test that checks the phone link and a remote modem's transmitter and 
  7838	   receiver.  Data entered from the keyboard is transmitted from the 
  7839	   initiating modem, received by the remote modem's receiver, looped 
  7840	   through its transmitter, and returned to the local screen for 
  7841	   verification.
  7842	
  7843	Remote Echo
  7844	   A copy of the data received by the remote system, returned to the 
  7845	   sending system and displayed on the screen.  Remote echoing is a 
  7846	   function of the remote system.
  7847	
  7848	ROM
  7849	   Read Only Memory.  Permanent memory, not user-programmable.  The 
  7850	   Courier's factory settings are stored in ROM and can be read (loaded) 
  7851	   into RAM as an operational configuration if DIP switch S10 is ON at 
  7852	   power on.
  7853	
  7854	Serial Transmission
  7855	   The transfer of data characters one bit at a time, sequentially, using 
  7856	   a single electrical path.  See Parallel Transmission.
  7857	
  7858	Start/Stop Bits
  7859	   The signaling bits attached to a character before the character is 
  7860	   transmitted during Asynchronous Transmission.
  7861	
  7862	SDLC
  7863	   Synchronous Data Link Control.  A protocol developed by IBM for software 
  7864	   applications and communicating devices operating in IBM's Systems 
  7865	   Network Architecture (SNA).  The protocol defines operations at the 
  7866	   link level of communications, for example, the format of data frames 
  7867	   exchanged between modems over a phone line.  See Bisync, Protocol, HDLC.
  7868	   
  7869	Synchronous Transmission
  7870	   A form of transmission in which blocks of data are sent at strictly 
  7871	   timed intervals.  Because the timing is uniform, no Start or Stop 
  7872	   bits are required.  Compare Asynchronous Transmission.
  7873	
  7874	   Some mainframes only support synchronous communications unless their 
  7875	   owners have installed a synchronous adapter and appropriate software.
  7876	
  7877	Terminal
  7878	   A device whose keyboard and display are used for sending and receiving 
  7879	   data over a communications link.  Differs from a microcomputer in that 
  7880	   it has no internal processing capabilities.  Used to enter data into 
  7881	   or retrieve processed data from a system or network. 
  7882	
  7883	Terminal Mode
  7884	   An operational mode required for microcomputers to transmit data.  In 
  7885	   Terminal mode the computer acts as if it were a standard terminal such 
  7886	   as a teletypewriter, rather than a data processor.  Keyboard entries 
  7887	   go directly to the modem, whether the entry is a modem command or data 
  7888	   to be transmitted over the phone lines.  Received data is output 
  7889	   directly to the screen.  The more popular communications software 
  7890	   products control Terminal mode as well as enable more complex 
  7891	   operations, including file transmission and saving received files.
  7892	
  7893	Throughput
  7894	   The amount of actual user data transmitted per second without the 
  7895	   overhead of protocol information such as Start and Stop bits or frame 
  7896	   headers and trailers.  Compare characters per second.
  7897	
  7898	Transmission Rate
  7899	   Same as Bit Rate.
  7900	
  7901	V.17
  7902	   An ITU-T standard for facsimile operations that specifies modulation 
  7903	   at 14.4K bps, with fallback to 12K bps.
