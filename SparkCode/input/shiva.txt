     1	Shiva at Networld '92
     2	Shiva Joins Novell Technical Support Alliance
     3	
     4	At Networld, Shiva Corporation will announce joining Novell, Inc., and
     5	other computer industry leaders as a member of the Technical Support
     6	Alliance (TSA), which gives customers coordinated post-sales support for
     7	multivendor computing environments. Novell's choice of Shiva as a
     8	technical alliance partner was a result of an extensive survey of the
     9	large NetWare user base. TSA members include 30 leading companies such as
    10	Apple, Borland, Digital Equipment Corporation, Microsoft and others. For
    11	more details, see the enclosed press release.
    12	
    13	Network Discussion Groups
    14	
    15	Throughout the show, Shiva will host a series of discussion groups on
    16	issues surrounding dial-in network access. The groups of network managers
    17	-over 100 in all will air their views, led by Dr. Eric Almquist, general
    18	manager of Decision Research Corporation and Lori Underhill, also of DRC.
    19	To keep the ideas flowing, Shiva also invited industry experts who will
    20	act as discussion catalysts. For information about trends that emerge in
    21	the discussion groups, contact Criswell Communications after Networld.
    22	
    23	Shiva Booth Demonstrations
    24	
    25	Shiva Corporation (booth #3624) will demonstrate a variety of dial-in
    26	solutions for PC and Macintosh vendor environments, along with its popular
    27	FastPath 5 LocalTalk-to-Ethernet router.
    28	
    29	NetModem/E
    30	
    31	Shiva will demonstrate the award-winning NetModem/E, the only dial-in
    32	networking product that gives PC users transparent access to Novell
    33	NetWare network data and services, even using graphical programs like
    34	Lotus Notes and Windows. The NetModem/E supports Novell's IPX and
    35	AppleTalk, so PC and Macintosh users can dial into a network and access
    36	resources as if they were local nodes. Other features include shared
    37	dial-out and network-to-network routing.
    38	
    39	The demonstration setup in Shiva's booth includes NetWare 3.11 running on a
    40	Compaq 386-33 computer along with the Mac NLM (NetWare Loadable Module).
    41	The network, based on a 10BaseT Ethernet topology, connects two Compaq
    42	workstations, a Macintosh IIsi, and Apple Computer's PowerBook. Both PCs
    43	and Macintosh computers can dial out to outside services and dial into the
    44	Shiva network in Cambridge, MA, through a NetModem/E. The NetModem/E uses
    45	Shiva's dial-in driver, which is compatible with the ODI (Open Data Link
    46	Interface) specification from Novell. The workstations can all dial out
    47	through a single NetModem/E to Shiva's bulletin board or CompuServe, or
    48	dial into a NetModem at Shiva for network-to-network routing.
    49	
    50	FastPath 5
    51	
    52	Shiva's FastPath 5, the fastest LocalTalk-Ethernet gateway, and the de
    53	facto standard for Macintosh routing, will also be demonstrated with
    54	Shiva's new routing software, called K-Star 9.1, that is faster and uses
    55	less memory than previous versions. K-Star 9.1 adds more support for SNMP,
    56	including support for 311 unique MIB objects. Version 2.2.1 of Shiva Net
    57	Manager, including a new management interface and enhanced diagnostics,
    58	will also be demonstrated. The Shiva Net Manager lets users manage all
    59	their FastPaths from anywhere on the internet.
    60	
    61	AppleTalk Remote Access Technology Demonstration
    62	
    63	Shiva is showing one of the first third-party demonstrations of AppleTalk
    64	Remote Access. The demonstration setup includes an Apple PowerBook running
    65	System 7 and AppleTalk Remote Access client software, a 9600 bps modem,
    66	and a Shiva hardware server and modem connected to an AppleTalk network.
    67	Using AppleTalk Remote Access and the modem, the remote PowerBook dials
    68	and connects to the Shiva server, and becomes a full node on the AppleTalk
    69	network. The PowerBook user can access file servers, printers, or
    70	electronic mail, as if he or she were directly connected to the network.
    71	
    72	User Champions
    73	
    74	Shiva salutes its User Champions from Polaroid Corporation, McDonald's and
    75	others in its booth presentation. Polaroid Corporation uses the NetModem/E
    76	in an automated identification system that stores digitized photographs,
    77	fingerprints and data on a central server. Clients in remote locations can
    78	access identification data using the NetModem/E - a transparent, easy
    79	solution. McDonald's Corporation also uses the NetModem/E, to give
    80	regional managers in remote offices access to central databases from
    81	anywhere.
    82	
    83	Expanded Management Team
    84	
    85	New management joining Shiva during the last two quarters include Bill
    86	Avery, VP-Product Development; Paul Chesterman, VP-Finance; Steve Van
    87	Beaver, Director of Customer Support; Ronna Alintuck, Director of
    88	Marketing. For more information, see the enclosed release.

   102	--------------------------------------------------------
   103	
   104	Boston, MA, Networld -- February 11, 1992 -- Today Shiva Corporation joined
   105	Novell, Inc., and other computer industry leaders as a member of the
   106	Technical Support Alliance (TSA), formed to provide customers with
   107	coordinated post-sales support for multivendor computing environments.
   108	
   109	Novell's choice of Shiva as technical alliance partner was a result of an
   110	extensive survey of the large NetWare user base. Shiva was recognized as a
   111	leading supplier of internetworking and dial-in remote access tools for
   112	Novell customers. Shiva is the only Macintosh hardware product company,
   113	other than Apple Computer Corp., currently in the Alliance.
   114	
   115	TSA members include computer industry leaders such as Apple, Borland,
   116	Compaq, Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, Lotus
   117	Development Corp., Microsoft, NetFRAME, Oracle, Ungermann Bass, 3Com and
   118	others. The TSA now includes 30 member companies.
   119	
   120	According to Richard King, Novell's Vice President of Service and Support,
   121	"With companies like Shiva joining the alliance, TSA will continue to
   122	provide the widest support coverage for complex, multivendor systems in
   123	the industry."
   124	
   125	The Technical Support Alliance agreement between Novell and Shiva outlines
   126	the responsibilities of a support team that includes technical support
   127	staff from both companies. Team members exchange training and technical
   128	information on their respective products and use each other's products in
   129	their technical support labs. A customer with a technical problem
   130	involving both companies can call either company to begin resolution of
   131	the problem. Procedures that involve a conference call between team
   132	members are defined for problems that require escalation.
   133	
   134	Steve Van Beaver, Shiva's Director of Product Support, said "Our
   135	participation in TSA reflects the fact that internetworking tools, and
   136	dial-in remote access, are becoming network critical applications. As
   137	users link multi-platform and multi-protocol environments, tools like
   138	routers and Shiva's NetModem become virtually as central as the network
   139	operating system."
   140	
   141	The NetModem/E is an integrated network communications server that provides
   142	remote IBM and compatible PCs and Macintosh computers with transparent,
   143	secure access to NetWare and AppleTalk Ethernet networks. The NetModem/E
   144	provides dial-in, shared dial-out, and network-to-network routing for
   145	PC-only networks, Macintosh-only networks, and mixed networks.
   146	
   147	Shiva's FastPath 5, the leading LocalTalk-Ethernet gateway, and NetModem/E,
   148	a network communications server for Macintosh and PC users, are both
   149	widely used to integrate Macintosh computers into Novell NetWare
   150	environments. The FastPath 5 is a multi-protocol LocalTalk-Ethernet
   151	gateway that routes AppleTalk Phase 1 and 2, TCP/IP, DECnet, IPTalk and
   152	NFS. It is the de facto standard for AppleTalk to Ethernet routing, with
   153	an estimated 80 percent of the market.
   154	
   155	Shiva's Dramatic Growth Results in Major Support Focus
   156	
   157	Shiva, recently recognized as 1 8th on the Inc. 500 list of fastest growing
   158	companies, has increased its support staff by over 50% during the last
   159	year. Senior technical support people have been added to the team,
   160	increasing the bandwidth and quality of the support. The company has also
   161	put a sophisticated call tracking system in place.
   162	
   163	According to Van Beaver, "Shiva has implemented an automated call tracking
   164	system based on Informix that allows us to create a life history of every
   165	customer who calls us. It saves both us and our customers valuable time as
   166	we help solve their problems. Perhaps more important, it provides feedback
   167	to the entire company about what customers are saying to us."
   168	
   169	Since joining the company, Van Beaver has also introduced a customer
   170	awareness program. As part of the program, every Shiva manager visits or
   171	phones several accounts each week, requesting feedback on product quality,
   172	application use, and the customer's overall satisfaction.
   173	
   174	Turnaround time is a priority, since networks play a mission-critical role
   175	in the corporate infrastructure. Said Van Beaver, "We've reduced our
   176	response time drastically. If a customer calls Shiva, they can feel secure
   177	that they'll talk with a support technician right away. And if we don't
   178	meet those expectations, we want to know!" Van Beaver previously managed
   179	product support at Intersolv (formerly Index Technology), where the
   180	telephone support group received the best rating in the CASE industry for
   181	three years running. He manages worldwide support, training and repair for
   182	Shiva's products.
   183	
   184	About Shiva
   185	
   186	Shiva Corporation is a leading supplier of dial-in remote access, and
   187	internetworking tools for Novell, AppleTalk, or mixed networks. Shiva
   188	products have won critical acclaim for their easy to use peripheral
   189	sharing, remote access and local- and wide-area network routing. According
   190	to market research firm International Data Corporation, Shiva Corporation
   191	is the leading supplier of AppleTalk internetworking systems with 56.1% of
   192	the market.
