     5	          INCLUDES A LISTING OF SHAREWARE VENDORS AT END OF THIS FILE

     9	       In some respects you should not need special software just for a 
    10	       laptop or notebook computer. The whole idea is to be able to run 
    11	       software that larger desktop computers run - but when and where you 
    12	       need it. That's the flexibility of computing in a laptop 
    13	       environment.
    14	
    15	       However, several software packages are frequently mentioned by 
    16	       laptop users as being valuable because of their minimal memory 
    17	       requirements or specialized features. 
    18	
    19	       For the many users, an integrated package containing a word 
    20	       processor, spreadsheet, database and modem package may be the 
    21	       best value since some needs may be met within ONE software 
    22	       system. Two standouts in this category are Microsoft Works and 
    23	       LotusWorks. 
    24	
    25	       No-Squint from SkiSoft Publishing is a small software utility 
    26	       which changes the tiny laptop screen cursor into a larger block 
    27	       which can be seen. Available from most software vendors or call 
    28	       617/863-1876. 
    29	              
    30	       Shareware packages with minimal memory needs which run all 
    31	       laptops include Alite (a spreadsheet), PC-Write Lite (word 
    32	       processor) and File Express. All are available from shareware 
    33	       disk vendors such as those listed at the end of this article as 
    34	       well as most computer clubs and BBS systems.
    35	
    36	       For hard drive users whose disk space is at a premium, the 
    37	       software package Stacker from Stac electronics compresses and 
    38	       expands files on crowded drives - a necessity for many laptop 
    39	       and notebook computer users. 
    40	
    41	       For modem work, many laptop users gravitate to the software 
    42	       package ProComm Plus (commercial software which also has a 
    43	       shareware variant) or the useful Telix package (shareware.) 
    44	
    45	       Other, distinct utility packages are frequently mentioned. 
    46	       Although not specifically designed for laptops and notebooks, 
    47	       these are useful software items....
    48	
    49	       PC TOOLS DELUXE. The quintessential toolkit of goodies DOS 
    50	       forgot to include. PC Tools contains a superb DOS shell for file 
    51	       management, a miniature database, file transfer utility, 
    52	       calculator, backup system, unerase data restorer, disk repair 
    53	       capability, security file wiper and literally dozens of other 
    54	       useful one-of-a-kind goodies. If you can only afford one 
    55	       utility, PC Tools Deluxe is it. 
    56	
    57	       THE PC MAGAZINE UTILITIES are continuing classics and favorites 
    58	       of many users. Available through most computer clubs and by 
    59	       modem from local BBS sources and PC Magazine as disk bonus 
    60	       offers when you subscribe to that periodical. An index to PC 
    61	       Magazine utilities is maintained through their on line PcMagnet 
    62	       modem service which can be reached by following printed 
    63	       instructions contained in every issue of PC Magazine. The 
    64	       utilities are in the public domain and generally available at no 
    65	       charge beyond a small disk copying or distribution fee. 
    66	       Most shareware distributors carry disk sets of the PC Magazine
    67	       utilities. Several utilities in this set are useful for laptops 
    68	       and allow file transfer between two computers, remote computing, 
    69	       file slicing and macro work on laptops. Since all are free and 
    70	       easily located they are genuine bargains for all laptop users. 
    71	
    72	       LABELPRO prepares labels and address stickers better than any 
    73	       competing program. Prepare nametags, casette tape labels, 
    74	       address stickers with ease. 
    75	
    76	       HOTLINE allows you to manage, search, sort and DIAL phone 
    77	       directory databases. A grownup electronic rolodex system which 
    78	       works better than any other program of this type. 
    79	
    80	       BROOKLYN BRIDGE & DESKLINK allow transfer of files between 
    81	       computers via a cable connector and facilitate the transfer 
    82	       between desktop and laptop computers with ease. 
    83	
    84	       KEYWORKS & NEWKEY are universal keyboard macro programs which 
    85	       issue a burst of keystrokes when you press only one or two keys. 
    86	       ESSENTIAL for all beginners to learn and use! NEWKEY is 
    87	       shareware. 
    88	
    89	       CHECK-IT & SYSTEM SLEUTH perform diagnostic tests to tell your 
    90	       what connections, cables, ports disk drives and components are 
    91	       working and why. You can locate bad memory chips and in general 
    92	       save time and frustration tracking down problems. 
    93	
    94	       QEMM-386 & 386MAX manage vast areas of RAM memory in 80386 
    95	       equipped computers. These can convert extended memory to 
    96	       expanded memory, move device drivers and terminate and stay 
    97	       resident programs efficiently, and remap BIOS and graphics video 
    98	       into faster RAM area memory. Subtle programs which help manage 
    99	       memory on more powerful DOS machines. 
   100	
   101	       MARK/RELEASE is a small program whose sole function is to 
   102	       install and remove TSR programs such as popup calculators, 
   103	       address books and others for minimum memory crowding and 
   104	       conflict. Shareware. 
   105	
   106	       FASTBACK PLUS allows reliable and quick backup of essential hard 
   107	       disk files to floppy disks and tape backup systems. A variety of 
   108	       options allows selective backup by date, data and file type. 
   109	
   110	       SUPER PC-KWIK provides a fast disk cache buffer system that 
   111	       speed processing and convenience for hard disk users. Speed is 
   112	       always a convenience when using a hard drive and SUPER PC-KWIK 
   113	       is the champion disk cache software utility. 
   114	
   115	       PKZIP is a unique shareware program which compresses files up to 
   116	       80% smaller in size! This frees up disk space on your hard drive 
   117	       and also allows faster file transfers when using a modem. PKZIP 
   118	       is as standard as DOS and almost as essential. 
   119	
   120	       FASTTRAX is a disk optimizer and file defragmenter whose sole 
   121	       job is to periodically assemble files into efficient contiguous 
   122	       sectors on a disk for speedy performance. A routine housekeeping 
   123	       function no disk drive owner can neglect. 
   124	
   125	       SCAN & CLEANUP are virus/trojan horse detection and erradication 
   126	       programs which are probably the best of the bunch. Shareware.
   127	
   128	       CED & PCED & LIST are utilities which browse files (list) and 
   129	       provide command line editing functions (CED and PCED) which are 
   130	       far superior to the functions DOS provides. All are shareware. 
   131	
   132	       HOT SHOT GRAPHICS & PIZAZZ PLUS function to capture screen 
   133	       graphics to transfer them to another software program for 
   134	       presentation or publication use. 
   135	
   136	       GRAPHICS LINK PLUS facilitates the conversion of graphics 
   137	       picture files between varying software packages. 
   138	
   139	       TYPEFAST resets the keyboard rate of your system so you can 
   140	       (good guess) type fast! Public domain utility from PC Magazine. 
   141	
   142	       PRINTCACHE is a print spooler. You can thus dump your document 
   143	       file out to the printer and within a split second come back to 
   144	       your program and keep working rather than sit there for 30 
   145	       minutes as your printer hogs the PC. 
   146	
   147	       ULTRAVISION adjusts cursor size and provides many differing 
   148	       typefaces on your screen if you don't care for the ones which 
   149	       came with your software or PC. 
   150	
   151	       MAGELLAN The ultimate text search utility. Search an entire hard 
   152	       disk quickly for the file that contains the phrase "swimming 
   153	       pool budget for Mr. Davis" or other search idea. Great for 
   154	       locating that document when piles of files seem lost on your 
   155	       hard drive. 
   156	
   157	       GRANDVIEW The best of the outliner programs. When you need to 
   158	       assemble, sort and prioritze tasks or documents Grandview is it. 
   159	
   160	       SOFTWARE BRIDGE & WORD FOR WORD PROFESSIONAL allow different 
   161	       word processing programs to swap documents in different file 
   162	       formats. Great for the office where each person uses a different 
   163	       word processing package. 
   164	 
   165	       Next, a short overview to highlight the differences between 
   166	       types of software and a brief listing of shareware disk vendors.
   167	
   168	       With so much software in the marketplace sometimes the hardest 
   169	       job is to select from overabundance and arrive at genuinely 
   170	       useful programs. Software is available in three basic flavors: 
   171	       COMMERCIAL, PUBLIC DOMAIN and SHAREWARE. 
   172	
   173	       Commercial software is sold by mail or through retail outlets 
   174	       and is generally protected by both legitimate and stringent 
   175	       copyright laws. Commercial software may in addition be copy-
   176	       protected (difficult or impossible to make spare disk copies) or 
   177	       non-copy protected (can be copied to another disk for safe-
   178	       keeping or archival purposes.) Commercial software is usually of 
   179	       good quality and can range in price from 10 dollars to several 
   180	       hundred dollars or more. 
   181	       
   182	       Public domain software represents computer programs which have 
   183	       been released into the public domain, do not require payment or 
   184	       registration fees to the author, and are frequently available 
   185	       from computer clubs, some libraries, and modem BBS telephone 
   186	       systems. PC Magazine utilities are examples of public domain 
   187	       software. 
   188	
   189	       Shareware, a third area of software interest represents programs 
   190	       whose author(s) request a donation or registration but are 
   191	       otherwise available in much the same manner as public domain 
   192	       software. Frequently "enticements" such as a documentation 
   193	       manual of program instructions, an upgrade disk or other bonus 
   194	       offer is made within the program to secure a registration fee. 
   195	
   196	       Which type of software is best? Probably a little of each, to be 
   197	       honest. Many people find that starting with several affordable 
   198	       commercial programs (to ensure fast, productive results) and 
   199	       then sampling shareware over time (to continue trying new 
   200	       software affordably) to be of value. Other computer owners find 
   201	       that starting with shareware and public domain software (to get 
   202	       a broad sampling of software variety at little cost) and then 
   203	       buying additional commercial programs as sophisticated needs 
   204	       grow a productive strategy.
   205	 
   206	       Back to shareware for a moment....
   207	
   208	       You do not have to be a hobbyist, hacker or computer guru to 
   209	       utilize shareware and public domain software. A short list of 
   210	       shareware distributors follows this section. 
   211	
   212	       Membership in a local computer club or user group is one way 
   213	       to obtain shareware. Many retail software and computer 
   214	       equipment stores maintain lists of local clubs. 
   215	       
   216	       Frequently a local and friendly Radio Shack salesman can give 
   217	       you a clue as to computer clubs. The clubs frequently augment 
   218	       club treasuries by sale of shareware disks. Membership with many 
   219	       clubs is optional - purchasing a shareware disk is convenient 
   220	       whether you are a member or not. Disk distribution or copying 
   221	       may fees hover around $3 to $5. 
   222	
   223	       A second, perhaps more convenient source for some people, is 
   224	       mail order sources of shareware, otherwise known as shareware 
   225	       distributors. A list of several shareware sources is provided 
   226	       at the end of this tutorial. 
   227	
   228	       A third avenue for locating shareware is either a BBS computer 
   229	       system (a computer in someone's home or office hooked by modem 
   230	       to telephone lines) or the larger commercial on-line services 
   231	       such as Compuserve, The Source and BIX. These larger commercial 
   232	       services can be the fastest way to locate and obtain shareware. 
   233	       The on-line modem route has the additional advantage that 
   234	       shareware can be located by electronic search/sort which 
   235	       certainly speeds up the process. Cost is obviously a factor. 
   236	       With a local BBS service the cost is simply that of a local 
   237	       phone call. Commercial services generally charge by the minute 
   238	       or hour and sometimes also involve long distance charges if a 
   239	       local line is not available. 
   240	
   241	       Next a list of popular mail order shareware distributors not to 
   242	       be confused with mail order software distributors of commercial 
   243	       software. Contact them and request a free catalog - you will 
   244	       be surprised at the depth and variety of shareware offerings. 
   245	       
   246	       A shareware distributor or disk vendor usually charges a nominal 
   247	       fee ($2 to $5) to copy and DISTRIBUTE a disk to you. If you find 
   248	       the shareware useful, you are encouraged to send the author of 
   249	       the package a final REGISTRATION FEE ($10 to $50 approximately) 
   250	       to use the package and receive updated copies, instruction 
   251	       manuals or bonus items to thank you for the courtesy of 
   252	       registering. Shareware is an honor system. The distributors make 
   253	       money charging a fee for a sample disk, but the author also 
   254	       deserves a registration fee if you find the shareware useful. 
   255
