    16	  TITLE: Running OPTIMIZE with Stacker
    17	      
    18	
    19	  OVERVIEW: Use this procedure with the Quarterdeck Office Systems program
    20	            OPTIMIZE to modify your config.sys and autoexec.bat files to
    21	            load all possible programs and drivers into high memory.  It is
    22	            designed to be used directly from a SSWAPed boot drive.
    23	
    24	  ISSUES/COMMENTS:
    25	  This procedure is for the version of OPTIMIZE that ships with QEMM386 5.x.
    26	  It will NOT work with the OPTIMIZE that ships with QEMM386 6.0.
    27	
    28	  This procedure is NOT necessary if:
    29	      1. A Stacker drive is not installed on drive C:, or
    30	      2. A Stacker drive installed on drive C: is not being SSWAPed.
    31	  For either of these situations, simply OPTIMZE according to the Quarterdeck
    32	  instructions.
    33	
    34	  Stacker version 2.0 users:
    35	  If you are using the /sync option to SSWAP, this procedure will cause SSWAP
    36	  to ask you if you want to update the changed config.sys and autoexec.bat.
    37	  Select No each time you are asked during this procedure.  The last time you
    38	  boot (in step 11) the files will be identical and you won't be prompted.
    39	
    40	  RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
    41	  You will need to know which drive letter refers to your boot drive.  This 
    42	  can be determined by running the Stacker utility SWAPMAP.  One of the lines 
    43	  will look like...
    44	
    45	                Drive x: was drive C: at boot time
    46	
    47	  What ever letter is "x:" will be the boot drive.  in the procedure below, 
    48	  the boot drive will be referred to as "x:".
    49	
    50	  IF YOU ARE INSTALLING QEMM FOR THE FIRST TIME...
    51	  After booting normally, exit any shell program you may be using and unswap 
    52	  your boot drive by entering: SSWAP C: x:  Then install QEMM.  
    53	  DO NOT exercise the option to optimize at this time.
    54	
    55	  STEP 1a IF YOU'VE JUST INSTALLED QEMM...
    56	          Assuming you used the default installation options and the QEMM 
    57	          files are all in C:\QEMM, enter the commands below and reboot the 
    58	          computer.
    59	          MKDIR x:\QEMM
    60	          COPY C:\QEMM\*.* x:\QEMM
    61	
    62	  STEP 1b IF QEMM WAS INSTALLED BEFORE STACKER then enter the command:
    63	          COPY C:\QEMM\RSTRCFG.SYS x:\QEMM
    64	
    65	  STEP 2  Enter the command: COPY x:\CONFIG.SYS C:\
    66	
    67	  STEP 3  If the Stacker generated autoexec.bat is on drive C:, rename it to
    68	          some other name using the REN command.  Next copy your autoexec.bat
    69	          file to C: by entering: COPY x:\AUTOEXEC.BAT C:\
    70	
    71	  STEP 4  Run OPTIMIZE.  Tell it to go ahead with it's step 1. When it 
    72	          presents you with the options for step 2, press <ESC> to return to 
    73	          the DOS prompt.
    74	
    75	  STEP 5  Enter the following commands.
    76	          COPY C:\CONFIG.SYS x:\
    77	          COPY C:\OPT2.BAT x:\
    78	          COPY C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT x:\AE.BAT
    79	          COPY C:\CONFIG.QDK C:\CONFIG.SYS
    80	
    81	  STEP 6  Reboot the computer.  When OPTIMIZE presents you with the options 
    82	          for step 3, press <ESC> to return to the DOS prompt.
    83	
    84	  STEP 7  Enter the following commands.
    85	          COPY C\CONFIG.QDK C:\CONFIG.SYS
    86	          COPY x:\QEMM\LOADHI.OPT C:\QEMM
    87	          COPY x:\OPT2.BAT C:\
    88	          COPY x:\AE.BAT C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT
    89	
    90	  STEP 8  Reboot the computer.  When OPTIMIZE presents you with the options 
    91	          for step 3, press <ESC> to return to the DOS prompt.
    92	
    93	  STEP 9  Enter the following command.
    94	          COPY C:\CONFIG.SYS x:\
    95	
    96	  STEP 10 Reboot the computer.  
    97	  
    98	  STEP 11 Enter the following commands, then reboot the computer one last time.  
    99	          COPY C:\CONFIG.SYS x:\
   100	          COPY C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT x:\
   101	        
   102	  STEP 12 If you wish to return to your prior configuration, enter the
   103	          following commands.
   104	          COPY C:\CONFIG.QDK x:\CONFIG.SYS
   105	          COPY C:\AUTOEXEC.QDK C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT
