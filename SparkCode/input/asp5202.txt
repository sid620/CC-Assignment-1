   462	                              How to read this catalog
   463	
   464	          ASP members have supplied product descriptions for each shareware
   465	          application they offer.  The catalog groups them by subject
   466	          matter and lists them alphabetically.  If you want to know the
   467	          name/address/phone for the author of a particular program, turn
   468	          to the index and look for the program by name.  You'll usually
   469	          see two page references: one describes the page where you read
   470	          about the program, the other mentions the page where you can find
   471	          information about the author (in Appendix A).  Just turn to the
   472	          appropriate page and scan for the name of the program.
   473	
   474	          The Association of Shareware Professionals does NOT rate members'
   475	          software for functionality or usefulness, nor can it attest to
   476	          the validity of any product description in this catalog.  That is
   477	          for you -- the user -- to decide.  Shareware, especially those
   478	          products authorized to carry the ASP logo, can be tested on a
   479	          "try before you buy" basis.  If the software doesn't meet your
   480	          needs, you won't have to worry about getting a refund.  (That's
   481	          the beauty of the shareware marketing concept.)
   482	
   483	
   484	          1.1  Minimum requirements
   485	
   486	          Every program description lists its computer and operating system
   487	          requirements (e.g. "IBM PC, DOS 2.0 or better").  Unless noted
   488	          otherwise, each program assumes you have a standard keyboard,
   489	          monitor, printer, and either two floppy drives or a hard disk.
   490	          And unless noted otherwise, programs written for the IBM PC
   491	          assume you have at least 512k of total installed RAM.  Many pro-
   492	          grams may also need specific hardware or software such as:
   493	
   494	             CGA monitor A video monitor capable of displaying CGA
   495	                         graphics.  This includes most "laptop CGA" com-
   496	                         puters, plus higher resolution monitors such as
   497	                         the EGA or VGA.  Some of the described programs
   498	                         may operate correctly with a Hercules monitor if
   499	                         you use a "CGA simulator" program; consult your
   500	                         video monitor manual for details.
   501	             Dual 720k drives
   502	                         At least two floppy drives capable of writing at
   503	                         least 720k of data per disk, or, preferably, a
   504	                         hard disk (see below).
   505	             EGA monitor A video monitor capable of displaying EGA
   506	                         graphics.  This almost always includes VGA and
   507	                         other higher-resolution monitors.  CGA and
   508	                         Hercules monitors won't suffice.
   509	             Hard disk   A fixed-, removeable-, or network-drive device
   510	                         capable of storing multiple megabytes of data.
   511	                         Some programs also assume you have at least one
   512	                         floppy drive in addition to the hard disk.

   518	             Hercules monitor
   519	                         A video monitor capable of displaying Hercules
   520	                         graphics.  CGA monitors won't suffice.
   521	             HP DeskJet  A Hewlett-Packard DeskJet or compatible printer.
   522	                         Some programs may require a DeskJet starting with
   523	                         a specific model such as the DeskJet Plus or
   524	                         having a specific feature like a RAM cartridge.
   525	             HP LaserJet A Hewlett-Packard LaserJet or compatible printer.
   526	                         (HP DeskJet printers recognize most, but not all,
   527	                         of the HP LaserJet command set.)  Some programs
   528	                         may require a LaserJet either starting with a
   529	                         specific model such as the LaserJet II or having a
   530	                         specific feature like the LaserJet IIIDSi.
   531	             Modem       A modem.  Almost all programs work with a "Hayes"
   532	                         modem, specifically one able to recognize the
   533	                         Hayes command set (an industry standard).  A few
   534	                         programs claim to work with non-Hayes modems too.
   535	                         Some programs may require the modem to operate at
   536	                         a specific rate of speed (e.g. "1200 baud").
   537	             Mouse       A mouse.
   538	             Network     A computer hooked up a local area network (LAN)
   539	                         system.  Program descriptions will normally
   540	                         specify the different types of LAN systems under

   543	                         programs need a plotter able to recognize the HPGL

   562	
   563	          All ASP member shareware products come with certain minimum
   564	          benefits when you register.  The author must acknowledge your
   565	          registration (you don't just get a canceled check) and must
   566	          provide a minimum amount of technical support for at least three
   567	          months.

   571	
   572	
   573	          Many authors provide other registration benefits such as a
   574	          printed manual, a master disk, a year of unlimited phone support,
   575	          source code, etc.  The product description will mention them when
   576	          appropriate.
   577	
   578	          In addition, every ASP member can offer the following benefits to
   579	          registered customers:

   590	          registrations.  Contact the author if you need assistance.
   591	
   592	          Some authors add "registration reminder screens" to the shareware
   593	          version of a program as a way to gently remind people to
   594	          register.  (The ASP sets ethical standards regarding it.)  Almost
   595	          all authors will either send a copy of the program without
   596	          reminder screens, or will disclose a method to disable the
   597	          reminders, once you register the product.

   615	          Registration:  The cost of a single user license, expressed in

   618	            less than the amount stated here depending on your situation.
   619	            (You can sometimes save money by "reading the fine print.")

   639	          Special instructions:  tells if the author limits product
   640	            distribution to the United States.  In some cases the author or
   641	            company may have signed a contract forbidding worldwide share-
   642	            ware distribution.  In other cases the product may only appeal
   643	            to an American audience (income tax software for example).  In
   644	            rare cases, U.S. federal laws may actually prohibit the author
   645	            or company from distributing the product in other countries.
   646	          Description:  a paragraph or two of text which describes the
   647	            shareware product in detail.  This information comes direct

  2212	            Offload is a new concept. It is not a general purpose archive
  2213	            such as PKZIP. OffLoad and its associated utilities allow you
  2214	            to identify files that really do not need to be on your hard
  2215	            disk, compress them and move them off to floppies. It maintains
  2216	            a catalog to allow you to track and restore any file from the
  2217	            archive automatically. Think of it as file manager, archiver,
  2218	            and disk cataloger all in one. It will let you free up hard
  2219	            disk space and maintain control of your files.

  2512	            A RAM Disk for IBM computers having EMS or XMS memory.  The
  2513	            program can be configured to provide disks greater than four
  2514	            megabytes, unlike many other programs.  NJRAMD is very fast,
  2515	            outpacing both RAMDRIVE and VIDSK from Microsoft. It is also
  2516	            very small -- requiring less than 700 bytes of DOS memory. Of
  2517	            course, the RAM Disk takes up as much memory as you configure
  2518	            it to.

 19293	            This cutie ties up your computer with a Very Important (but

 19296	            favorite job by pressing the appropriate function key. The
 19297	            activity on screen looks too important to be interrupted. If

 19650	            "SPIN" key makes the corners of the walls spin at random, to
 19651	            open different doorways.  Each spin costs one of the gems you
 19652	            must collect.  Bumping solid walls or knocking over paint cans
 19653	            costs extra points.  The object is to maneuver through the

 19655	            the fewest steps.

 20925	            Create flowing graphic images as you move your mouse. If art
 20926	            can be fleeting, transitory and personal - then Fantasy is an
 20927	            artist's tool. You are the artist and the audience. It's a tool
 20928	            for personal performance art. Like building sand castles or
 20929	            blowing bubbles, each performance is different and highly
 20930	            personal.
 20931	
 20932	            As you move the mouse the image constantly moves and responds
 20933	            in never-ending, never-repeating animated sequences.
 20934	            Performances can be recorded and replayed. Demos included.

 20954	            No one really knows when PEG solitaire was invented. Some
 20955	            stories trace it to prisoners during the French Revolution, but
 20956	            published descriptions date at least 100 years earlier.  Most
 20957	            likely the game is even older.  PEG presents variations on the
 20958	            classic peg solitaire with multiple starting positions, and
 20959	            varying endgames.  One of the pleasures of playing the game on
 20960	            your computer is that you can quickly set up the board to try
 20961	            different strategies. Ages 8 to 88.

 20981	                                   About shareware
 20982	
 20983	
 20984	          18.1  Assn. Shareware Professionals
 20985	
 20986	            The Association of Shareware Professionals (ASP) formed in 1987
 20987	            to strengthen the future of shareware as an alternative to
 20988	            traditional (retail) software marketing.  It also serves as an
 20989	            information clearing house for its members and the public at
 20990	            large.  ASP members subscribe to a code of ethics and are
 20991	            committed to the shareware concept.
 20992	
 20993	            The ASP demands professionalism from its members.  Authors must
 20994	            acknowledge every registration (you get more than just a
 20995	            canceled check) and they must provide at least three months of
 20996	            support for their products.  ASP members must also live up to
 20997	            any other benefits they offer.
 20998	
 20999	            You can turn to an ombudsman for help if you can't resolve a
 21000	            problem with an ASP author or disk vendor.  Members must
 21001	            explain this in every shareware program & disk vendor catalog.
 21002	
 21003	            Few people need the ombudsman's help.  ASP members represent
 21004	            the cream of the crop in the shareware industry, but it's nice
 21005	            to know you can turn to someone if you think you got a raw
 21006	            deal.  Unfortunately, it happens -- authors have been kicked
 21007	            out because of repeated complaints.
 21008	
 21009	            The Association monitors Congress for potentially damaging
 21010	            legislation and has sent spokesmen to testify before
 21011	            congressional subcommittees.  It has also taken on the respon-
 21012	            sibility of safeguarding the term 'shareware' itself.  ASP has
 21013	            filed motions in countries as far away as England and South
 21014	            Africa to stop people who attempt to claim it as a trademark
 21015	            word.
 21016	
 21017	            ASP members 'meet' online in a public forum of the CompuServe
 21018	            network (GO SHAREWARE).  Members send & receive messages,
 21019	            transmit files, and exchange valuable information.  Old hands
 21020	            in the shareware business pass along their insights to new
 21021	            members.  The group holds public and private debates and
 21022	            members vote on major issues by sending private messages to the
 21023	            Association secretary.
 21024	
 21025	            The ASP holds yearly 'face to face' meetings and appears at
 21026	            various trade shows around the country (including COMDEX and
 21027	            PC-EXPO).  It also provides speakers who lecture on every
 21028	            aspect of shareware.  You can learn more by writing to the
 21029	            Association of Shareware Professionals, 545 Grover Road,

 25437	
 25438	            This appendix lists shareware products now "retired" by the
 25439	            author.  Retired products no longer receive the minimum levels
 25440	            of support, and the authors have agreed to return any registra-
 25441	            tion fees sent in for the software.
 25442	
 25443	            An author may retire a shareware product for any number of
 25444	            reasons.  Some applications have outlived their usefulness;
 25445	            others may have grown too costly to continue supporting due to
 25446	            competition from other authors.

 25477	
 25478	            This appendix notes the author of each program listed in this
 25479	            catalog.  It comes in extremely handy when you want to see if a
 25480	            given program comes from an ASP member, or when you want to
 25481	            know the current version number/release date for a program.
 25482	            Hint: look in the index for the program (by name) if you want
 25483	            to see a full description for the program or learn the author's
 25484	            address & phone number.  You'll find page references to all the
 25485	            information you need.
