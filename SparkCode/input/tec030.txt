     8	If you are a STACKER 2.0 user with an SSWAPped boot drive, you can now
     9	OPTIMIZE with a minimal amount of effort using an upgraded SSWAP.COM.
    10	This file is available on Compuserve, the STAC BBS, and by mail through
    11	STAC technical support.
    12	
    13	The upgraded SSWAP handles the many changes OPTIMIZE makes "on the fly".  
    14	It works with QEMM 5.XX as well as the latest version of QEMM 6.  Just 
    15	copy SSWAP.COM to the STACKER directory in the C: drive as well as the 
    16	STACKER directory on the SSWAPed host drive.  You can determine the host 
    17	drive letter by typing: STACKER  at the command line. You must also use 
    18	the /SYNC parameter on the SSWAP device line in Config.sys.
    19	
    20	For example:   DEVICE=C:\STACKER\SSWAP.COM C:\STACVOL.DSK /SYNC
    21	
    22	*Stacker 2.0, /EMS, and the QEMM 6 STEALTH option:
    23	     If Stacker is using EMS and you choose to use QEMM's STEALTH
    24	option, you must include the DBF=2 parameter on the QEMM device line
    25	in Config.sys. For example:
    26	
    27	    DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS RAM ST:M DBF=2          
    28	
    29	Note for QEMM 6.00 and 6.01 users: 
    30	
    31	     If you OPTIMIZE with the SSWAP upgrade and Stacker is using EMS, 
    32	you will need to follow ONE of the simple procedure below.  This is 
    33	because a conflict occurs when ANY two or more programs, which OPTIMIZE 
    34	attempts to load high, access EMS memory during the OPTIMIZE process.
    35	
    36	     NOTE:  Both procedures assume that SSWAP.COM has already been copied 
    37	to both STACKER directories.  These procedures are not required for
    38	QEMM 5.x, and 6.02 or later.
    39	
    40	Procedure 1:
    41	
    42	     A) Run OPTIMIZE as you normally would.  It will lock up during its
    43	        final reboot.
    44	
    45	     B) Power down the system, then power back up.
    46	
    47	     C) Clean up by running QEMM's UNOPT.BAT which should be in the QEMM
    48	        subdirectory on both the compressed and uncompressed drives.
    49	
    50	     D) Run OPTIMIZE again.  This time it should work without incident.
    51	
    52	 Procedure 2:
    53	
    54	     A) Create a text file (using SEDIT) called OPTIMIZE.EXC.  (NOTE the
    55	        EXC extension stands for "exceptions".  This file lists those
    56	        device drivers and programs which OPTIMIZE should not attempt to
    57	        load high.)  This file should be placed in the QEMM subdirectory
    58	        on both the uncompressed and compressed drives.  In most cases
    59	        it's sole contents should be the following text:
    60	
    61	                          SSWAP.COM
    62	
    63	        However, any other CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT device drivers and
    64	        programs which access EMS memory (execpt for STACKER.COM) should 
    65	        also be listed in this file, each on its own line.
    66	
    67	
    68	     B) Run OPTIMIZE.
