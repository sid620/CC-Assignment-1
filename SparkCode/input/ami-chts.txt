    73	This cheat is not for a game called 'All Games', but rather a cheat that will
    74	work on all games.  Attach a genlock and everything runs 25% slower, giving
    75	you a chance to get a feel for those really blazing games that normaly kick
    76	your ass without the trainer.  If that's not an economical way to cheat
    77	though, and you are running NTSC and have the necessary setup, boot the game
    78	in PAL to slow it down.  PAL users who just can't seem to find a game that
    79	is fast enough for them, take heart, a solution is at hand.  Switch your
    80	machine to NTSC and see a dramatic improvement in game speed (18%).

   104	you should attempt to sale, press the keys 1-5.  These items are, of course,
   105	non-existant, but the shopkeeper must be blind or totally mad, as he will
   106	cheerily offer you exorbatant amounts of gold for absolutely nothing.  The
   107	best thing is, you can repeat this as often as you like and repeatedly sell
   108	the same non-existant item to the same fool many times.  Their is but one
   109	problem with this trick, if you hit numbers higher than 5 this will most
   110	certainly crash the game.

   118	key a few more times.  Now you can go wherever you want.  A much easier
   119	solution is to turn off the computer for at least 30 seconds and boot

   137	       S - Slow       Makes the ball really slow and easy to hit

   154	Now you may press S and both exits will open allowing you to exit the level
   155	without doing much but typing in the cheat right and making up your mind to
   156	go left or right.  How fun.  A better cheat would be to type in DALEY88 at
   157	the same pink screen and restart at the same level you last died on.  That's
   158	more like it.

   208	To become indestructable, gain infinite money and fuel, complete the first
   209	attack level.  When the shields/weapons screen appears, move the cursor to the
   210	top left corner of the screen.  This will place it in the shields box.  Now
   211	press the joystick button while hitting the + key on the keypad.  The screen
   212	will flash, indicating that the cheat mode has been activated.  If the screen
   213	does not flash,  keep pressing fire and hitting the + key simulataneously. It
   214	will work eventually.  Now transfer all the energy to the weapons.  Shields
   215	can still be drained by hits and colliding with objects, but once it reaches
   216	000, the ship can not be destroyed.
   217	
   218	To win at the game, simply choose the last planet as the destination.  Once
   219	you enter the spaceport, there will be a short animation showing your ship

   222	Hold down the + key on the keypad and press fire.  Then during play the F1

   286	
   287	Some small help for playing the game successfully:
   288	
   289	When you create your characters, it may be a good idea just to make all of
   290	them Dracons.  This is untested, but unless you have at least one of this
   291	fire breathing race you surely wont survive the game.  So maybe it would be
   292	good to have more.  Use a good mix of the classes, try to take one of each
   293	spell class and a good solid thief that is at full strength.  Get a good
   294	enough thief and you dont need a fighter.
   295	
   296	It may be slow, but keep rolling till you get the best character possible.
   297	Be sure to make at least one character female, there are places in the game
   298	where this is a must.  Dont do it and be sorry later!
   299	
   300	Diversify your skills.  Have each character specialise in a few skills
   301	relative to his class.  Do not worry about developing weapons skills, you
   302	have no use for them if you created your party correctly.
   303	
   304	In fights early in the game use Dracons breath attack, just be careful not
   305	to overextend yourself.  Rest after each encounter, backing up your hard
   306	work.  Allways search the area after a combat.
   307	
   308	Search each square you step in.  Not only this, but search facing all four
   309	directions, many things can only be found that way.
   310	
   311	Thieves are not always true.  If you find a lock and have your thief open it,
   312	allways guess it is POISON unless you are 100% sure (i.e. tried it before)
   313	because it is better to suffer something else than to die by getting this
   314	wrong.
   315	
   316	Dont bash doors early in the game!  If your characters are not very strong
   317	you will be sorry.  Jammed doors do you no good, as you might never be able
   318	to open them again.  Same goes for picking the lock.  Wait till you get a
   319	caster capable of conjuring KNOCK KNOCK with at least 18 points (prefereably
   320	24) and do it this way.  It is much more sure.
   321	
   322	Once you know there are secret panels or buttons,  keep walking past them
   323	until you discover them.  You can find them by looking at the maps and know
   324	where they are, sometimes it takes awhile to sense them.
   325

   328	Barbarian (Palace)
   329	------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   330	On the final level when you confront Drax, walk forward and when the first
   331	fireball comes, jump, then do a forward roll into Drax.  If you can't even
   332	get that far then the best way to defeat an oppoent is to roll into him until
   333	he reaches the side, then kick him, roll in to him again and kick him, keep
   334	repeating this method and you'll soon finish the game.

   351	     left three times, up, and left.  Level 3:  up, right, right, up, left,
   352	     right, up, right, left, left, up, left, left, up, up, right, right,
   353	     left, left, up.  Level 4: hit the fireballs, then try to leap across.
   354	     Several low chops will destroy it.  Next is the Pit Demon; when he
   355	     reaches out, use an overhead chop to hit his arms; repeat until death.
   356	     Next, Drax himself!  Wait until he pauses between spells, and hit him
   357	     with a flying head chop!  The End...

   489	------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   490	In game pressing  ESC  to pause the game and pressing G will transport you to
   491	the end of level guardian.
   492	
   493	Hints for the first three levels:
   494	
   495	        LEVEL 1: Get the green armous as soon as possible. If you have all
   496	     of the amulet, don't go to the sphere unless you have collected at
   497	     least four lots of monster remains, you'll need them to battle the end
   498	     of level guardian. He's a bit soft in the head, so time your jumps
   499	     carefully, and hit him there.
   500	
   501	        LEVEL 2: There are four planets to visit, go to everyone if you
   502	     want to get maximum points. Again, the green armour is very useful, so
   503	     get it as quickly as possible. There's loads of ammo for the guardian
   504	     of this level, unfortunetly that means there's loads of monsters to
   505	     deal with. The back of the guardians head is the weak spot.
   506	
   507	        LEVEL 3: Stand on the slabs and summersault. There are six planets
   508	     here, and the transporters are more difficult to so, so you have to
   509	     watch more carefully.
   510	
   511	
   512	
   513	Bionic Commando
   514	------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   515	Exit from level 1 exactly when the timer reads 1 for nine lives and a super
   516	high score.
   517	
   518	
   519	
   520	Blood Money
   521	------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   522	Press HELP and then 1 or 2 and you will restock your supply of lives or money,
   523	respectively.
   524	
   525	
   526	
   527	Bombuzul
   528	------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   529	Actually there is a hidden pause control in the game.  When you press the
   530	spacebar to access the overhead map screen, if you keep it held down the clock
   531	stops until you release it.
   532	
   533	When reaching a new level, it's worthwhile to sacrifice a life to see the
   534	explosion pattern.  When trying to detonate a pulsing bomb, pick it up; it's
   535	easier to see its size.  You are invulnerable to explosions when teleporting,
   536	so use it to your advantage!  A blind droid can't activate switches.  Also,
   537	here's a list of the level access codes:

  1591	solve the screen, look closely.  Some of the puzzles get pretty obscure after

  1593	seeing the solution earlier.
  1594	
  1595	Look before you leap.  Think about how the screen will look from a flipped

  1598	
  1599	Make sure you have enough switches, at least 10 per screen.  It is possible
  1600	to get stuck on a downward slope with no way to get back up or kill yourself,

  1619	On level two, buy a shield and a magic potion, then get three fireballs and
  1620	three stars.  Spend all of your remaining money on food and health.  Collect
  1621	all the gems in the usual manner, then get a key and make for the exit.  Now
  1622	comes the tricky bit...
  1623	
  1624	When you descend the last ladder, two thieves will appear.  Make sure that
  1625	you don't quite have enough energy to survive a direct contact!  Before
  1626	going down the ladder, release your magic potion, then climb down and open
  1627	the door.  Stand in front of the door ready to leave, but don't push up yet!
  1628	Wait until the thieves jump down at you and as soon as they touch you push
  1629	the joystick up.  You may loose that life, but then something rather strange
  1630	will happen.  The bonus will start to whiz up for quite some time, until
  1631	the game starts again on world two with 28 extra men and about five million
  1632	points!

  1761	
  1762	The King's Quest series of games uses the debug command and interpreter for
  1763	the programmers (up to KQIII) KQIV doesn't have it because of the tremendous
  1764	size of the game.  Have some fun and press the "ALT" key then "D" then
  1765	"Return or Enter" (I think twice) then type in either GET OBJECT (and type in
  1766	a random #) or "TP" for transport (and a random #) and see what happens.  It
  1767	works., and if you're tired looking for a certain object the "Get Object"
  1768	function works great!

  1782	------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1783	Fights - Proficent swordplay is  essential if your to  get anywhere in
  1784	     the game.  The neck chop is one  of the more effective blows,  but the
  1785	     program blocks repetition of single moves. To get around this, occass-
  1786	     ionaly switch to a differnt move in order to enable the neck chop once
  1787	     again. Give generously  to the poor and youll  be a step closer to ob-
  1788	     taining the Sword of the Spheres.
  1789	
  1790	     The Palace - To enter  the palace,  youll need  to get  the invitation
  1791	     from the elusive Gloop, found in Novala. Once you have it, keep out of
  1792	     fights or you  could lose  it for good.  When you get into the palace,
  1793	     ask Nedrod  three questions  and he will give you the talisman,  which
  1794	     can help you find another useful item.  Answer the Princess's question
  1795	     with "Its a secret".  She will give you the  Ring of Belz,  which will
  1796	     only work in conjunction with the spell scroll.
  1797	
  1798	     In General - Objects are not always found in the same places from game
  1799	     to game, so a detailed search of both fore and backgrounds is often in
  1800	     order.  To survive the final  confrontation,  a high psychic rating is
  1801	     needed, which can be increased by donating skringles to the poor. Dis-
  1802	     orderly conduct can have the opposite effect.  The safest technique in
  1803	     the space battles, is to slow right down as soon as you see the aliens
  1804	     shoot them all,  then power at full  steam until the next lot.  Follow
  1805	     Readheads ship  if you see it.  Heatpro  tablets are  necessary if you
  1806	     beam down to one  of the hotter planets.  Makes notes of  what you are
  1807	     told, and use any new  names or subjects to  weavel out every last bit
  1808	     of information from the characters.

  1816	In LASER SQUAD, for fun do The Assassins on Level 1.  Buy no armour, give the
  1817	corporal an M4000 with two reloads, the next two rocket launchers with four
  1818	rockets each, and the last two nothing at all.  Deploy in the entrance, in the
  1819	gap in the outer wall , and take the house to pieces with the rockets, waiting
  1820	for droids or Regix to show up - get them with Jonlan's M4000.  I managed to
  1821	do the scenario with one shot - it went BETWEEN the leaves of the door, blew
  1822	up against a wall and Regix was on the other side.  End of story, fade to
  1823	black.

  2010	First a little hint: The green diamonds are essential as these award you
  2011	with an extra life. Some of the red diamonds will allow control over two
  2012	bats but this is more of a hinderence as the two bats prove confusing.
  2013	Avoid the blue squares as they will shrink the size of your bat.

  2227	Various hints:
  2228	 
  2229	     * Allstars are better than champs, 
  2230	     * Only steal if you actually hit the ball, 
  2231	     * Try to get a lot of runs early, as the computer team improves
  2232	       towards the end, 
  2233	     * Bunting rarely works, 
  2234	     * Halfway through the match, swap Laws for Wells and Wratten for
  2235	       Harris. 
  2236	More[n,Y,=]                * The best pitchers are Oliver, Perez, Leary, Cook.  The others
  2237	       will only be successful for a short while, 
  2238	     * Never pitch fastballs to the center as they will usually result
  2239	       in home runs, 
  2240	     * Change pitchers after a few innings, because as they get tired,
  2241	       their accuracy and speed get worse.

  2276	Some general tips:  
  2277	
  2278	     Arrange your party so that the  first line consists of two strong warr-
  2279	     iors, Raistlin and Goldmoon.  This allows you to use Raistlin's magic &
  2280	     the healing staff of Goldmoon without too much hassle.  Save Tanis and
  2281	     Riverwind for the later levels, where the bows come in handy.  When
  2282	     fighting Gully Dwarves, use Tasslehoff who is the same height as them.
  2283	     His sling stones will never miss.  Avoid fighting Hatchlings, they're
  2284	     not worth it.  Just turn and run when you meet one; when you reach an
  2285	     intersection move into a new path and wait a little.  When you return,
  2286	     the Hatchling will have gone.  Killing Bozaks: two methods:  1) get
  2287	     Raistlin to  use a web, sleep or charm spell to stun it, then send a
  2288	     warrior to clobber it to death, or 2) select Flint, who is a dwarf; 9
  2289	     out of 10 times, the Bozak's shots will go over his head get close to
  2290	     enter melee combat, and use low thrusts to kill it.  Spectral Minions:
  2291	     they're easy to kill, so use a warrior.  Wraiths: a well-timed throw of
  2292	     an axe kills them every time.  If you miss, use a sword and chest-thrust
  2293	     movements.  Don't let it get too close to you!  Spiders: use low thrusts
  2294	     to keep them at bay.  If they get through your guard, retreat until you
  2295	     can turn and fight again.  The blue and green potions restore health,
  2296	     red slows down monsters, and yellow give your characters extra confid-
  2297	     ence.

  2310	To attain infinite lives just hold down the M key.  If that's not enough,
  2311	type CHEATMODE then you be able to use the F10 key to skip levels.
  2312	
  2313	Or maybe some codes would help:
  2314	
  2315	          Level 1 - Just hit return     Level 4 - LUGOSI
  2316	          Level 2 - WOLFMAN             Level 5 - NOSFERATU
  2317	          Level 3 - HAMMER              Level 6 - GARLIC
  2318	
  2319	How about typing BOGEYMAN for infinite lives?

  2455	------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  2456	Before attempting to go into the ants' nest, you should first save Elmer to
  2457	get more flamethrower fuel.  Some time between the 8th and 10th (I don't
  2458	remember the exact day), he will leave a note in his station saying that he is
  2459	going hiking in the SW Volcanic Cone.  Go to the volcano, fight the ants, and
  2460	next day, visit Elmer's station.  He'll thank you for saving his life and give
  2461	you more flamethrower fuel.
  2462	
  2463	The entrance to the ants' nest will never appear on the main map, but there
  2464	are several other ways to get there:
  2465	
  2466	        - By taking a flight from Hilber's Field.
  2467	
  2468	        - By driving a tank from a battle going on at a nearby location.
  2469	
  2470	        - By going south when you are in a battle at the M1 mine.
  2471	
  2472	The entrance to the nest doesn't stay open long enough for you to get in
  2473	before the ants start invading the various locations in the town so you'll
  2474	have to wait until they do.  The 11th is the best day to enter the hole since
  2475	it is very hot and there are few ants around.  If you try cooler days, there
  2476	will probably be too many of them around for you to handle.  Also, if you
  2477	decide to get to the hole by plane, you can land safely on the dirt road
  2478	parallel to the tracks leading to the M1 mine.

  2591	to a lower Tech, higher law level world and sell the merchandise.  The ideal
  2592	pleanets are: LLUN/EFATE (when using the trader character on the disk you can
  2593	purchase a PGMP for 130500 credits) and STUR/EFATE (where not only is there
  2594	a PGMP lying on the floor nesar the Gun shop, but they can be sold for 244500

  2707	
  2708	PART 1:
  2709	        Move back slightly when you encounter a mine.  They're much less
  2710	        sensitive from the rear.
  2711	
  2712	        Avoid jetski bullets by jumping or ducking.
  2713	
  2714	        When approaching sharks, move the up and down nut left and right.
  2715	
  2716	        Octopi and sea monsters are easily thwarted by holding down
  2717	        fire until both missiles are ignited and then releasing.
  2718	
  2719	        Struggle to dock with a submarine?  Put a mini-sub in the gap between
  2720	        the tailfin and the hull, face the left of the screen and move
  2721	        upwards slowly, the computer takes over the docking procedure for you.
  2722	
  2723	PART 2:
  2724	        The code is 948411.
  2725	
  2726	        Arrows indicate the direction of the lifts.

  2729	        Stand over the body and search thoroughly.
  2730	
  2731	        To get the code of an official, you must shoot him with a gun,
  2732	        not a flamethrower.
  2733	
  2734	        To enter computer codes, stand by a terminal, push up and
  2735	        you'll be asked for a code.  Two of the codes are:
  2736	
  2737	        Transmit message: 1st or 2nd transmission official
  2738	        Open door: 1st or 2nd machine official
  2739	
  2740	        To open the reactor door, use the terminal next to the reactor.  The
  2741	        computer confirms the bomb is planted.  Go out, use the game terminal
  2742	        you used to open the door and transmit the following: OABERYAMD.  Now
  2743	        type END at the ready prompt and run like hell to the conning tower.

  2752	want to jump onto the next stage, simply press H then ESCAPE.  Still, if you
  2753	can't do the first stages, then skipping to the later ones may be even more
  2754	embarrassing, so be warned!

  2784	Pause, press M.  After you hear the laser type MOTHERFUCKENKIWIBASTARD for
  2785	unlimited lifes.  Or FLUFFY KIWIS does the same thing.
  2786	
  2787	On level 2.4 stand at the entrance to the octopus room and fire to the right a
  2788	few times.  A warp will take you to level 3.1.
  2789	
  2790	To access the cheat mode just press "TRY CHEATING" (including the space) keys
  2791	together while on the title screen.  The border should turn grey and when you
  2792	start the game you have infinite kiwi's and the ability to skip levels by
  2793	pressing "<-".
  2794	
  2795	Anyone heard of the whirl-winds?  They advance you levels.  Near the end of
  2796	level 1.1 there are three large steps that you must climb to reach your
  2797	brother (sister?), who is in a cage.  Stand at the left edge of the top step,
  2798	facing left and jump.  But as you jump, fire.  If your current weapon is
  2799	arrows, fire halfway up, but if your weapon is bombs, fire at the top of your
  2800	jump.  A whirl-wind should appear after four hits, and it will take you to
  2801	level 1.4.
  2802	
  2803	In 1.4, you will be in a little box under some water.  Go up and to the right,
  2804	and you come out in a small room with three boxes on the right hand side.  Go
  2805	up these, and you will see 4 long spaces, the top one having an "N" and a "D"
  2806	in it.  Go up to the top one, get the letters, stand in the centre of the
  2807	space, facing left, and fire.  Yep, you guessed it, another whirl-wind.  This
  2808	one takes you to level 2.4.
  2809	
  2810	Or on level 2.4 , stand at the entrance to the room where the giant octopus
  2811	is located and fire to the right several times. A warp will appear that will
  2812	take you to the beginning of level 3.1.
  2813	
  2814	On level 1, part 1, move to the area containing three men with boomerangs,
  2815	shoot them.  Go to the top of the third platform, move to the left, jump and
  2816	fire five times.  A whirlwind in a box will appear, if you enter it, you will
  2817	be transported to the end of the level.  Then you can free Tiki's naughty
  2818	friend just by jumping.
  2819	
  2820	When you recch the ice whale, move to the right-hand side of the spikes, avoid
  2821	the crystals, and wait until he picks you up.  Once inside the whale, you can
  2822	start shooting, but avoid the ice drops.
  2823	
  2824	Meeting the rock monster without bombs makes him difficult to pass.  So
  2825	collect bombs, go to the highest platform and shoot him.  Kill it by either
  2826	dodging the bullets and hitting it when the doors open, or by fireballs.
  2827	
  2828	The last boss you encounter is the balloon seal.  He cant be killed, by blows
  2829	to the body, so you must hit the balloon.  Be careful for the balloon seal is
  2830	armed with a cannon and shoots cannon balls at Tiki.
  2831	
  2832	The town names are:
  2833	
  2834	        AUCKLAND, ROTORUA, WAITOMO CAVES, STRAIT COOK, and MT COOK.

  2841	without them for now, and it gives you enough to get a half way decent deck.
  2842	You will eventually need to buy them back before you start entering
  2843	cyber-space, or you will be killed easily.

  2938	More[n,Y,=]           At the end of a level, between the time when you kill the last bastard and
  2939	the time appears, rolling the mouse down causes damage to decrease.
  2940	
  2941	For the most accurate shot possible, pause the game with F1, position your
  2942	crosshairs over the selected enemy, unpause the game, click the button and
  2943	blast him to hell.
  2944	
  2945	
  2946	
  2947	Operation Thunderbolt
  2948	------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  2949	You should get a score of at least 50,000 (good luck!) and on the high scores
  2950	table enter your name as WIGAN NINJA.  Now hit F7 to skip about the levels.
  2951	
  2952	But level skipping probably won't help without infinite lives, so type your
  2953	name as EDOM TAEHC instead and that's what you have.
  2954	
  2955	If the game isn't quite tough enough, perhaps typing SPECCY MODE into the
  2956	high score table will provide more challenge, doubling the amount of
  2957	enemies.
  2958	
  2959	On the title screen you should press F8 and hit the fire button at the same
  2960	time for laser sights, but on 2 player games hit F2 instead instead of F8.

  2965	------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  2966	Just a few tips - When cruising the highway don't stop shooting, and always
  2967	choose the highest paid mission.  Buy fuel carefully - only enough for that
  2968	level, after level 1 you MUST buy a leanburner.  Try to stay in the middle of
  2969	the road and travel fast, travelling slowly only burns more fuel.  Fire bombs
  2970	are more useful than smart bombs when you learn how to use them.
  2971	Bulletproofing is necessary after level 2.  When travelling through the
  2972	barriers the best speed is 90-120mph.

  2995	When the title screen appears, type AVALON.  It should flash indicating
  2996	you now have unlimited lives!  If that doesn't work, try the following:
  2997	
  2998	Start a 2 player game.  Make it as far as you can with player 1.
  2999	With player 2, you must be able to make it as far as the fairy to collect
  3000	your boots.  Now that you have gotten your boots, you are going backwards to
  3001	where you started.  Push the THIRD cactus on the way back, and a yellow
  3002	pacman will appear.  Get it, now kill player 2.  Continue playing with
  3003	player 1.  Every time player 1 dies, get the yellow pacman with player 2 and
  3004	kill player 2 immediately.  As long as you keep getting the yellow pacman
  3005	with player 2, player 1 will never die.
  3006	
  3007	Hints:
  3008	
  3009	Level 1 - Run to the third fire hydrant, and when you get there, jump over
  3010	          it and push it to the left.  This will give you a blue hat that
  3011	          will make you invulnerable to the little ghosts that fall from
  3012	          planes.
  3013	
  3014	Level 2 - Run to the third cactus, and push it to the left.  You will now be
  3015	          invulnerable for the entire level!
  3016	
  3017	Level 3 - After getting your magic boots, push the third cactus on the way
  3018	          back for a free life.
  3019	
  3020	- Jump on the roof of ghost's car to escape
  3021	- Only use powerpills when ghosts are in range, or else it is wasted
  3022	- When you reach the breaktime sign, jump when you are about 1 inch away
  3023	  for a bonus (depending how high you are when the level ends)

  3197	These aren't really cheats, but some things the manual was rather unclear
  3198	about or didn't mention at all.  First of all, when inventing, it is often
  3199	helpful to zoom in all the way on the towns (or anywhere for that matter).
  3200	It makes things go faster, and your inventions will be done sooner.  Also, in
  3201	order to get a captain on your side, find a town with a captain in it.  He'll
  3202	be the guy in the cape, usually standing in the middle of town.  Next, set
  3203	your aggression level to Passive.  Then go and attack the town.  Make sure you
  3204	can beat them first!  If you attack on Passive, your men don't kill anyone,
  3205	but rather forcibly coerce them into joining your side.  If you win, you will
  3206	get everyone in the town on your side, including the captain.

  3260

  3325	And now, some tips: once in the core, you can't quit.  So choose droids with
  3326	good lasers, Jack and Spud for example.  The Quadralien mother is made up of
  3327	4 separate pieces grouped together and surrounded by Earthling boxes.  The
  3328	mother can only be destroyed by blowing up each box from a different
  3329	direction.  From the starting point there are three exits: north, east, and
  3330	west.  Go east and destroy the first box, return to the starting point, and
  3331	go north to destroy the second box.  You will now have both droids to blow
  3332	the remaining boxes.  Go west through the one-way force field, and get the
  3333	other.  Don't forget to keep recharging.

  3352	We all know that collecting the seven different-colored gems gives you an
  3353	extra life and a 100,000 Bonus Gem once the Boss is defeated. But collecting
  3354	all of the gems in the correct order of color (from left to right on the gem
  3355	counter) not only awards you the life and Bonus Gem, it also grants you access
  3356	to a magical secret room.  When you reach the end of the level, a silver door
  3357	appears. `You don't have to fight the Boss. (Hint A)
  3358	
  3359	Even more useful is how to create any color gem.  The screen is split into
  3360	several invisible vertical stripes of color.  When a gem falls, its color is
  3361	determined by the `color' of the area into which it fell.  Now all you have to
  3362	do is guage carefully where the dead enemy will fall to create the gem color
  3363	of your choice. (Hint B )

  3395	     1) When inside the 2nd building, wear your IR goggles. 
  3396	     2) Don't walk in front of soldiers, since it will trigger an
  3397	        alarm and about 8 soldiers will jump you! 
  3398	     3) If you enter a dark room, use the glow tube. 
  3399	     4) Never use a gun without a silencer. 
  3400	     5) Turn off the electric door with switch located several
  3401	        rooms away. 
  3402	     6) The mine detector won't work without the generator. 
  3403	     7) The IR goggles won't work without a battery. 
  3404	     8) Watch out for IR beams, since they also trigger alarms. 
  3405	
  3406	Here's a list of items you can find:

  3408	arrows, silencer, first aid kit, IR goggles, glow tube, battery, key, mine,

  3713	------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  3714	A few hints and tips follow on how each of the four zones (armys, factorys,
  3715	mines and rigs) effect the game:
  3716	
  3717	MINES - Each time a mine is purchased the income you receive for each time
  3718	        pass doubles.
  3719	FACTORYS - The more factorys you have the faster more weapons are produced,
  3720	           these are essential.
  3721	RIGS - These supply you with the fuel for each mission run.  The more rigs
  3722	       you have the greater the  amount of fuel you receive for each
  3723	       time pass.
  3724	ARMYS - For every army unit you own, the enemy slows down, eg. you have one
  3725	        army unit, for each four time passes that occur the enemy won't move
  3726	        for one time pass.  If more than 50% of the sector is occupied by the
  3727	        enemy then you will lose one of your assests for each time pass that
  3728	        occurs.  The best solution is when 30% of the sector is occupied go
  3729	        an attack the enemy.

  3786	collection (December or November if playing at fast speed) quickly set the

  3793	the first. Repeat as many times as you want. Then just
  3794	bulldoze all the excess powerlines and you can build on the new land.
  3795	
  3796	To MAKE land you simply make a 3 lane highway across any water source.
  3797	When you make a road by putting 3 sections of road on top of three section
  3798	of road on top of three sections of road (3 by 3) you make 1 section of
  3799	land in the middle.                WWWWW   WWWWW     To make more land, just
  3800	                                   WRRRW   WRRRW     move you roads over, or
  3801	           L= land                 WRRRW = WRLRW     make your roads 4 by 4,
  3802	           W= water                WRRRW   WRRRW     5 by 5 etc.  Play with

  4800	the mousehole.  When the two eyes flash knock the ball in and off you go to
  4801	the Mystery hole.

  4829	If you have seen Dawn Of The Dead, you already have a good idea on how to
  4830	solve most of the puzzles.  But here's some extra tips anyway: 1) To lock up
  4831	the mall to keep zombies from getting in, you need to park the trucks over
  4832	the entrances.  Get the key from the office on the 2nd floor and go to the
  4833	4th floor where the keys to the trucks are kept.  2) To keep the dead zombies
  4834	from coming to un-life, lock them up in the freezer in the basement. 3) before
  4835	you can go play in the basement, you need a source of light.Get the fuses and
  4836	gloves from the 3rd floor and go to it!!
