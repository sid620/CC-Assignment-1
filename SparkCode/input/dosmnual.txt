    85	            
    86	            
    87	            In order for you to use your computer effectively, there are
    88	            a few basic commands from PC/MS-DOS you need to learn. In
    89	            addition, you need to understand your computer's disk drives
    90	            and the proper care and handling of floppy disks.
    91	            
    92	            This brief manual, designed for new computer users, will
    93	            help you get the most from your computer.  It is organized
    94	            according to the most frequently used commands.  An index at
    95	            the back of the manual will help you find the sections you
    96	            need.
    97	            
    98	            For each command, I have provided an explanation of the
    99	            command, plus information on how to use the command in
   100	            several situations.  The examples should help you perform
   101	            the operations you will use every day.
   102	            
   103	            There are a few conventions used in this manual which you
   104	            need to know:
   105	            
   106	            1. When you see a word surrounded by <>, that means to press
   107	            the key marked with that word.  For example, if you see
   108	            this:  <Enter>,  press the Enter (<__|) key.
   109	            
   110	            2. In some cases, spaces are important to a command. In
   111	            those cases, you will see this: (sp).  When following an
   112	            example, press the spacebar when you see (sp).
   113	            
   114	            3. Otherwise, type the command as it is written in the
   115	            example.

   139	                            DISK DRIVES AND FLOPPY DISKS
   140	            
   141	            There a two basic types of disk drives you are likely to
   142	            encounter:
   143	            
   144	            1. Floppy disk drives.
   145	            2. Hard disk drives.
   146	            
   147	            Your computer will have at least one floppy disk drive.  It
   148	            may well have two.  These drives have names.  The left or
   149	            top drive is usually called Drive A:.   The right or lower
   150	            disk drive (on two-drive systems) is usually called Drive
   151	            B:.
   152	            
   153	            Depending on your system, you may also have one or more hard
   154	            disk drives.  If you have one hard disk, it will probably be
   155	            named Drive C:
   156	            
   157	            All DOS commands refer to these drive names.  In order for a
   158	            command to act on a drive, you must specify the correct
   159	            drive name.  For example, the command  Format b:  acts on
   160	            Drive B:.  If you supply the wrong drive name, you may
   161	            destroy data on a drive.
   162	            
   163	            IMPORTANT: If you give a command without specifying a drive
   164	            name, the computer assumes you are referring to the drive
   165	            name specified at the system prompt.  That prompt looks like
   166	            this:
   167	            A>
   168	            Any command you give while this prompt is on the screen will
   169	            act on Drive A:.  This can lead to problems.  If you enter
   170	            the command FORMAT while you are using Drive C:, you may
   171	            destroy all the files on Drive C:.  Get into the habit of
   172	            ALWAYS specifying the drive name when entering a command.
   173	            
   174	            
   175	            NOTE: All DOS commands must be given while the system prompt
   176	            (A> or C>) are on the screen. If you make an error when
   177	            entering a command, use the backspace key to delete
   178	            characters, not the left arrow key on the number pad.
   179	            
   180	            
   181	            
   182	            FLOPPY DISKS
   183	            
   184	            Floppy disks are the most common method of storing programs
   185	            and data for your computer.  There are three basic types:
   186	            
   187	            1. 5 1/4" double-sided/double-density floppy disks.
   188	            2. 5 1/4" double-sided/high-density floppy disks.
   189	            3. 3 1/2" floppy disks.

   203	
   204	
   205	            The typical computer uses the first type.  It can store 360
   206	            Kbytes of data, or about 150 pages of double-spaced type.
   207	            Most often, these disks are marked DS/DD 48tpi.
   208	            
   209	            The second type, used only on IBM PC/AT or compatible
   210	            computers, can store 4 times as much data.  They are marked
   211	            DS/HD 96tpi.
   212	            
   213	            The third type of floppy disk is used primarily on portable
   214	            computers.  It can store 720 Kbytes of data, twice as much
   215	            as the first type of disk.
   216	            
   217	            If you have an AT-type computer, its disk drives can read
   218	            data written on the first type of disk.  However, disks
   219	            written on the High-density drives cannot be read by other
   220	            PC-compatible computers.
   221	            
   222	            Many times, AT-type computers use a 360 Kbyte disk drive as
   223	            drive B:.  If this is the case, record all files to be read
   224	            on other computers on drive B:.
   225	            
   226	            INSERTING A FLOPPY DISK
   227	            
   228	            Hold the disk with its label up, then insert it into the
   229	            disk drive.  When it is fully inserted, close the drive door
   230	            with the lever, or push the drive button.
   231	            
   232	            Some computers have their drives in a vertical position.
   233	            When inserting a disk into this type of drive, the label
   234	            should face left.
   235	            
   236	            CARE FOR FLOPPY DISKS
   237	            
   238	            Floppy disks are a very reliable storage device, but they
   239	            require some care.  Here a some simple rules:
   240	            
   241	            1. Never touch the disk surface in the exposed windows.
   242	            2. Store disks in cool, dry places.  Disk storage boxes are
   243	            ideal.
   244	            3. Keep floppy disks away from magnetic fields, such as
   245	            motors, telephones, and other electrical devices.
   246	            4. Handle disks with care.  Avoid bending them.
   247	            5. When writing on disk labels, use a felt-tip pen when the
   248	            labels are attached to the disk.  Avoid excess pen pressure.
   249	            6. Keep floppy disks in their protective sleeves whenever
   250	            they are not in the disk drive.
   251	            7. Store backup copies of important disks away from your
   252	            work space.  If problems occur, your programs and data will
   253	            be in another location, and can be retrieved.
   254	            8. Avoid spilling anything on a floppy disk.  Keep coffee
   255	            and other beverages away from your computer and work areas.
   256	            9. Never remove a disk from its drive while the drive light
   257	            is on.  This can cause you to lose all data on the disk.

   270	
   271	            10. Avoid subjecting floppy disks to static electricity.
   272	            Ground yourself by touching a grounded object if you have
   273	            been walking on carpets or if there is static in the air.

   338	            HARD DISK DRIVES
   339	            
   340	            Hard disk drives, on the other hand, are more permanent.
   341	            You do not remove the disk; it remains in the drive at all
   342	            times.
   343	            
   344	            A typical hard disk drive holds from 10 to 40 megabytes of
   345	            data. This allows you to store the equivalent of up to 100
   346	            floppy disks or more on a single hard disk drive.
   347	            
   348	            Hard disk drives are typically named C: or D:.  Your
   349	            computer probably starts up with from the hard disk drive if
   350	            no disks are in drive A: or drive B:
   351	            
   352	            Hard disks pretty much take care of themselves, with one
   353	            exception.  If your hard disk does not have an automatic
   354	            head parking feature (see the owner's manual), you should
   355	            use the program supplied with the drive to park the head
   356	            whenever you turn off your computer.  The owner's manual
   357	            which came with your drive will provide this information,
   358	            along with the name of the parking program.

   404	                                FILES AND FILENAMES
   405	            
   406	            
   407	            Every program on your computer, and your data, is stored in
   408	            files on your disk drives.  There are a few things you need
   409	            to know about files.
   410	            
   411	            Each file must have its own, unique filename.  You may
   412	            already be familiar with the structure of filenames, but
   413	            here is a rundown.
   414	            
   415	            Each filename is made up of two parts: 1. File Name  2.
   416	            Extension.  Let's look at a typical file:
   417	            
   418	                                    COMMAND.COM
   419	                                      /      \
   420	                             File Name        Extension
   421	            
   422	            The File Name may be up to 8 characters long, and may
   423	            contain letters and numbers.  It is separated from the
   424	            Extension by a period or decimal point.
   425	            
   426	            The Extension, which can be up to 3 characters, can also be
   427	            made up of both letters and numbers.
   428	            
   429	            Combined, the two parts of the filename can help you
   430	            identify a particular file.  Choose a filename for each file
   431	            carefully, to help you find that file later.
   432	            
   433	            Certain extensions are reserved by DOS for specific types of
   434	            files.  .COM, .EXE, .BAS, and .BAT are reserved extensions,
   435	            and should not be used for ordinary files.
   436	            
   437	            Certain punctuation characters can be used in filenames,
   438	            while others cannot.  For simplicity's sake, avoid the use
   439	            of punctuation characters in your filenames.
   440	            
   441	                                    DOS COMMANDS
   442	            
   443	            Before going on to discuss individual DOS commands, here are
   444	            a few facts about command structure:
   445	            
   446	            There are two basic types of DOS commands:
   447	            
   448	            1. Internal commands.
   449	            
   450	            These commands, like COPY, DEL, and TYPE, are stored in your
   451	            computer's memory and can be used anytime you see the system
   452	            prompt.  Many of the most-used commands fall into this
   453	            category.

   469	            
   470	            2. External commands.
   471	            
   472	            This group of commands are stored on your disk.  To use
   473	            them, either insert the DOS floppy disk, or change to the
   474	            directory on your hard disk which contains DOS external
   475	            commands.  See the directory section of this manual for more
   476	            details. Examples of external commands include FORMAT,
   477	            DISKCOPY, and CHKDSK.
   478	            
   479	            The section of this manual devoted to each command will tell
   480	            you whether the command is internal or external.
   481	            
   482	            Some commands can take several forms.  These separate forms
   483	            are used by including various parameters with the command.
   484	            Parameters, which will be discussed with each command, are
   485	            indicate by a / mark.  Here is an example of a command with
   486	            an attached parameter:
   487	            
   488	                                       DIR/W
   489	            
   490	            All DOS commands must be activated by pressing the <Enter>
   491	            key after typing the command.
   492	            
   493	            NOTE: You can type all DOS commands in either upper or lower
   494	            case letters.
   495	            
   496	            The rest of this manual will present DOS commands in
   497	            alphabetical order.  Only the most common commands are
   498	            included.  For information on other commands, see your DOS
   499	            manual.

   535	                                       CHDIR
   536	            
   537	            CHDIR is an internal command.
   538	            
   539	            If your computer has a hard disk drive, some of the programs
   540	            and data on that drive may be stored in sub-directories.  If
   541	            so, they will be marked as subdirectories.  To check this,
   542	            type DIR at the C> or D> prompt. Sub-directories will be
   543	            shown like a filename, but with <DIR> in the place of an
   544	            extension.
   545	            
   546	            The CHDIR command allows you to change to any of the sub-
   547	            directories.  You need to do this to use the programs in any
   548	            sub-directory.
   549	            
   550	            EXAMPLE:
   551	            
   552	            To change to a sub-directory called WP, type the command as
   553	            shown below:
   554	            
   555	            CHDIR(sp)\WP<Enter>
   556	            
   557	            The command can be abbreviated to CD:
   558	            CD(sp)\WP<Enter>
   559	            
   560	            After executing this command, you will be in the WP
   561	            directory.  To go back to the main directory, type the
   562	            following command:
   563	            
   564	            CHDIR(sp)..<Enter> or CHDIR\<Enter>
   565	                  -or-
   566	            CD(sp)..<Enter> or CD\<Enter>
   567	            
   568	            Commands given while in a sub-directory act on that
   569	            directory only.
   570	            
   571	            
   572	                                       CHKDSK
   573	                                          
   574	            CHKDSK is an external command.
   575	            
   576	            The CHKDSK command allows you to check any disk on your
   577	            computer.  It looks for bad sectors on the disk and also
   578	            tells you how much memory is available on your computer.
   579	            
   580	            Use this command from time to time to check important floppy
   581	            disks and to check your hard disk drive for problems.  If
   582	            you begin to see bad sectors on your hard disk drive, and
   583	            the number of bad sectors starts to increase, the hard disk
   584	            drive may be developing problems.  Remember: most hard disk
   585	            drives have some bad sectors, so watch for increases.

   601	            
   602	            Example:
   603	            
   604	            To check the disk in drive A:, use the following command:
   605	            
   606	            CHKDSK(sp)A:<Enter>
   607	            
   608	            To check your hard disk:
   609	            
   610	            CHKDSK(sp)C:<Enter>
   611	            
   612	            You can substitute any drive name.
   613	            
   614	            NOTE: Since this is an external command, you must insert
   615	            your DOS disk in drive A: or CHDIR to the directory which
   616	            contains DOS external commands on your hard disk.
   617	            
   618	            
   619	                                        CLS
   620	            
   621	            
   622	            CLS is an internal command.
   623	            
   624	            The CLS command clears your computer's screen and moves the
   625	            system prompt to the top of the screen.
   626	            
   627	            Example:
   628	            
   629	            To clear the screen, type the following command:
   630	            
   631	            CLS<Enter>
   632	            
   633	            
   634	                                        COPY
   635	            
   636	            COPY is an internal command.
   637	            
   638	            The principal use of the COPY command is to copy files from
   639	            one disk or directory to another.  It's use is very simple.
   640	            
   641	            Example:
   642	            
   643	            To copy the file LETTER.DOC from drive A: to drive B:, enter
   644	            the following command:
   645	            
   646	            COPY(sp)A:LETTER.DOC(sp)B:<Enter>
   647	            
   648	            To copy LETTER.DOC to Drive B: and change its name on drive
   649	            B: to LETTER1.DOC, type the following:
   650	            
   651	            COPY(sp)A:LETTER.DOC(sp)B:LETTER1.DOC<Enter>
   652

   665	
   666	
   667	            
   668	            To copy LETTER.DOC from the WP sub-directory on drive C: to
   669	            drive B:, use this format:
   670	            
   671	            COPY(sp)C:\WP\LETTER.DOC(sp)B:<Enter>
   672	            
   673	            Wildcards
   674	            
   675	            DOS also allows you to copy more than one file at once.  Two
   676	            symbols, called wildcards, allow you to specify groups of
   677	            files.  Here are the wildcards:
   678	            
   679	            * indicates any group of characters.
   680	            ? indicates a single character.
   681	            
   682	            Examples:
   683	            
   684	            To copy all the files with the extension .DOC from drive A:
   685	            to drive B:, use this command:
   686	            
   687	            COPY(sp)A:*.DOC(sp)B:<Enter>
   688	            
   689	            To copy ALL files from drive A: to drive B:
   690	            
   691	            COPY(sp)A:*.*(sp)B:<Enter>
   692	            
   693	            NOTE: Wildcards will not copy files within subdirectories,
   694	            unless you are in that subdirectory or have a path statement
   695	            including the subdirectory.
   696	            
   697	            To copy LETTER1.DOC, LETTER2.DOC, etc. from drive A: to
   698	            drive B:
   699	            
   700	            COPY(sp)A:LETTER?.DOC(sp)B:<Enter>
   701	            
   702	            NOTE: If you are copying to a blank diskette, you must
   703	            FORMAT the diskette first.(See the FORMAT command)
   704	            
   705	            The COPY command, along with most other DOS commands can be
   706	            used with PATH statements to copy files into subdirectories.
   707	            See the section on the PATH command for more information.
   708	            
   709	            
   710	                                    DEL or ERASE
   711	            
   712	            DEL and ERASE are internal commands.
   713	            
   714	            These commands are identical, and can be used
   715	            interchangeably. The delete files from a disk, so use them
   716	            carefully.
   717	            
   718	            Examples:
   719	            
   720	            To delete LETTER.DOC from drive B:
   721	
   722	
   723	
   724	
   725	
   726	
   727

   731	
   732	
   733	            
   734	            DEL(sp)B:LETTER.DOC<Enter>
   735	            
   736	            Similarly, to delete LETTER.DOC from the directory WP on
   737	            drive C:
   738	            
   739	            DEL(sp)C:\WP\LETTER.DOC<Enter>
   740	            
   741	            You can use wildcard characters with DEL and ERASE, in the
   742	            same way you did with the COPY command.
   743	            
   744	            Example:
   745	            
   746	            To delete all files with the extension .DOC from drive B:
   747	            
   748	            DEL(sp)B:*.DOC<Enter>
   749	            
   750	            To delete ALL files from drive B:
   751	            
   752	            DEL(sp)B:*.*<Enter>
   753	            
   754	            Any time you use the *.* wildcard to delete files, the
   755	            computer will ask you:
   756	            
   757	            Are you sure Y/N?
   758	            
   759	            Check what you are doing, then, if you are sure you want to
   760	            delete all files from that disk, type Y, then press the
   761	            Enter key.
   762	            
   763	            As with the COPY command, path information can be added to
   764	            the drive specification, if needed.
   765	            
   766	            CAUTION: Use extreme care when using wildcards with the DEL
   767	            or ERASE command.  Pay special attention to the drive name
   768	            you have designated.  It is possible to inadvertently delete
   769	            all files on your hard disk with a single keystroke.  BE
   770	            CAREFUL!
   771	            
   772	            
   773	                                        DIR
   774	            
   775	            DIR is an internal command.
   776	            
   777	            The DIR command allows you to see a list of the files stored
   778	            on any disk.  Along with the filenames, it also provides
   779	            other information about the files.
   780	            
   781	            Examples:
   782	            
   783	            To see a list of files on drive A:
   784	            
   785	            DIR(sp)A:<Enter>
   786	            
   787	
   788	
   789	
   790	
   791	
   792	
   793	
   794	
   795	
   796	                                       Page 13
   797	
   798	
   799	            You will see a list of files, along with the size of each
   800	            file in bytes, and the date and time that data was last
   801	            entered in that file.  In addition, the amount of space left
   802	            on the disk will be displayed.
   803	            
   804	            Sometimes, a disk will have more files than can be displayed
   805	            on the screen.  Using the DIR command will cause the files
   806	            to scroll off the top of the screen faster than you can read
   807	            them.  To avoid this, add the parameter /P.  Here is an
   808	            example:
   809	            
   810	            DIR(sp)B:/P<Enter>
   811	            
   812	            DOS will fill the screen with file information, then print
   813	            at the bottom of the screen:
   814	            
   815	            Press a key to continue:
   816	            
   817	            After you press ANY key, another screenfull of data will be
   818	            displayed.  This continues until the entire directory has
   819	            been presented.
   820	            
   821	            There is another option with DIR. To see a list of files on
   822	            disk A:, arranged in multiple columns, but without file size
   823	            and other information:
   824	            
   825	            DIR(sp)A:/W<Enter>
   826	            
   827	            
   828	            NOTE: Use the DIR command frequently to check on the files
   829	            on your disks and to keep track of the amount of disk space
   830	            available.
   831	            
   832	            
   833	                                      DISKCOPY
   834	            
   835	            DISKCOPY is an external command.
   836	            
   837	            Use DISKCOPY to make exact duplicates of floppy disks.  You
   838	            can only use this command on floppy disk drives, typically
   839	            drive A: and drive B:
   840	            
   841	            To copy a disk on a single drive computer:
   842	            
   843	            DISKCOPY<Enter>
   844	            
   845	            The computer will ask you to:
   846	            
   847	            Place the SOURCE diskette in Drive A: then press Enter.
   848	            
   849	            After pressing the Enter key, the computer will read all the
   850	            data on the disk, then ask you to:
   851	            
   852	            Place the TARGET diskette in Drive A: and press Enter:
   853	
   854	
   855	
   856	
   857	
   858	
   859	
   860	
   861	
   862	                                       Page 14
   863	
   864	
   865	            
   866	            Remove the original disk, and replace it with a blank disk.
   867	            After you press Enter, the data will be copied onto the
   868	            blank disk.
   869	            
   870	            On a computer with two floppy disk drives:
   871	            
   872	            DISKCOPY(sp)A:(sp)B:<Enter>
   873	            
   874	            You will see the following:
   875	            
   876	            Place SOURCE diskette in Drive A:
   877	            Place TARGET diskette in Drive B:
   878	            Strike a key when ready:
   879	            
   880	            Place the original disk in drive A: and the blank disk in
   881	            drive B:.  Press a key, and the computer will make a copy
   882	            for you.
   883	            
   884	            When the process is complete, you will see:
   885	            
   886	            Make another copy? Y/N?
   887	            
   888	            Enter a Y to start the process again, or N to return to the
   889	            system prompt.
   890	            
   891	            Note:  If the new disk is not formatted, DISKCOPY will
   892	            automatically format it before copying.
   893	            
   894	            CAUTION: Make sure the second disk does not contain data,
   895	            since the DISKCOPY command will destroy any data on the
   896	            disk.
   897	            
   898	            You cannot use the DISKCOPY command with drives other than
   899	            A: or B:.
   900	            
   901	            
   902	                                       FORMAT
   903	                                          
   904	            FORMAT is an external command.
   905	            
   906	            Before you can write data onto a floppy disk, it must be
   907	            formatted to hold the data.  DOS has a command which does
   908	            this automatically.
   909	            
   910	            To format a disk in Drive A:
   911	            
   912	            FORMAT(sp)A:<Enter>
   913	            
   914	            You will see on the screen:
   915	            
   916	            Insert a new diskette for Drive A:
   917	            Press ENTER when ready.
   918	            
   919	
   920	
   921	
   922	
   923	
   924	
   925	
   926	
   927	
   928	                                       Page 15
   929	
   930	
   931	            Place an unformatted disk in Drive A: and press the Enter
   932	            key.  DOS will format the disk and make it ready to accept
   933	            data.  When the process is complete, you will see:
   934	            
   935	            Format Complete: Format another? Y/N?
   936	            
   937	            If you want to format more diskettes, press Y, and the
   938	            process will repeat. If not, press N and you will return to
   939	            the system prompt.
   940	            
   941	            CAUTION: Like DISKCOPY, FORMAT destroys all data on the
   942	            disk.  Use caution when formatting disks.
   943	            
   944	            WARNING!!!!  In some versions of DOS, FORMAT can act on
   945	            Drive C: or other hard disk drives.  If it does, all data on
   946	            your hard disk will be destroyed.  Because of this, ALWAYS
   947	            indicate the drive to be formatted.  Check your typing
   948	            carefully when using this command.
   949	            
   950	            
   951	                                       MKDIR
   952	            
   953	            
   954	            MKDIR is an internal command
   955	            
   956	            The MKDIR command allows you to create new sub-directories.
   957	            
   958	            Examples:
   959	            
   960	            To create a new subdirectory, called CHAPTER1 on drive C:
   961	            
   962	            MKDIR(sp)C:\CHAPTER1<Enter>
   963	            
   964	            To create a subdirectory within a subdirectory, for example
   965	            to create the subdirectory CHAPTER1 in the directory NOVEL
   966	            on drive C:
   967	            
   968	            MKDIR(sp)C:\NOVEL\CHAPTER1<Enter>
   969	            
   970	            If you are already in the directory in which you want to
   971	            place a subdirectory, you do not need the \ character.  For
   972	            example, If you had used the CHDIR or CD command to move to
   973	            the NOVEL subdirectory, create the CHAPTER1 subdirectory
   974	            like this:
   975	            
   976	            MKDIR(sp)CHAPTER1<Enter>
   977	            
   978	            Note: You can abbreviate the MKDIR command to MD.
   979	            
   980	            Example:
   981	            
   982	            MD(sp)CHAPTER1<Enter>
   983	            
   984	
   985	
   986	
   987	
   988	
   989	
   990	
   991	
   992	
   993	
   994	                                       Page 16
   995	
   996	
   997	            CAUTION: Be certain you know which directory you are in
   998	            before using the simplified form of this command.  Otherwise
   999	            you may create a subdirectory in an unwanted place.  To
  1000	            avoid confusion, use the full format, including drive name,
  1001	            as in the first and second examples.
  1002	            
  1003	            
  1004	                                        PATH
  1005	            
  1006	            PATH is an internal command.
  1007	            
  1008	            If your computer has a hard disk drive, many of the programs
  1009	            you use, along with data files, will be stored in
  1010	            subdirectories.  Normally, you have to change directories
  1011	            with the CHDIR (CD) command to get access to files.
  1012	            
  1013	            DOS provides another method with the PATH command.  This
  1014	            command allows you to tell DOS where to look for your files.
  1015	            You can instruct the computer to look in several places for
  1016	            any file you name in another command, or from a program.
  1017	            
  1018	            Examples:
  1019	            
  1020	            To tell DOS to look for your wordprocessing programs and
  1021	            files for the NOVEL subdirectory, as used as an example in
  1022	            other parts of this manual:
  1023	            
  1024	            PATH(sp)\WP\NOVEL<Enter>
  1025	            
  1026	            Using this format, DOS will automatically search the \WP
  1027	            directory and the \NOVEL subdirectory for files when you
  1028	            give a command from any other directory.
  1029	            
  1030	            Now, suppose you have a number of programs you use
  1031	            frequently.  They are in different subdirectories with the
  1032	            following names: \DB   \WP   \123   \MAIL   &  \SALES.
  1033	            
  1034	            In addition, there are further subdirectories, such as
  1035	            \NOVEL in the \WP directory and \BUSINESS and \PERSONAL in
  1036	            the \MAIL directory.
  1037	            
  1038	            The following command will allow you access to all the
  1039	            programs listed above:
  1040	            
  1041	            PATH(sp)\DB;\WP\NOVEL;\123;\MAIL\BUSINESS\PERSONAL;\SALES<Enter>
  1042	            
  1043	            Notice that the main directories are separated with semi-
  1044	            colons, while subdirectories of these directories are
  1045	            specified with the backslash (\) character.
  1046	            
  1047	            NOTE: If a path you specify does not exist, DOS will give
  1048	            the following message:
  1049	            
  1050	            No Path
  1051	
  1052	
  1053	
  1054	
  1055	
  1056	
  1057	
  1058	
  1059	
  1060	                                       Page 17
  1061	
  1062	
  1063	            
  1064	            If DOS cannot find the file you specify in any of the
  1065	            subdirectories, this message will appear:
  1066	            
  1067	            Bad command or filename
  1068	            
  1069	            In either case, check your path command to make certain it
  1070	            is correct.  If you type PATH<Enter> without any other
  1071	            information, DOS will display your current path designation.
  1072	            
  1073	            NOTE: Along with the directory names, you can also include
  1074	            drive names in a PATH command.  Use this feature to make DOS
  1075	            look on your floppy drives for files.
  1076	            
  1077	            
  1078	                                        REN
  1079

  1081	            REN is an internal command.
  1082	            
  1083	            Use the REN command to change the name of a file.
  1084	            
  1085	            Example:
  1086	            
  1087	            To change the file LETTER.DOC to LETTER2.DOC:
  1088	            
  1089	            REN(sp)LETTER.DOC(sp)LETTER2.DOC<Enter>
  1090

  1092	                                       RMDIR
  1093	            
  1094	            
  1095	            RMDIR is an internal command.
  1096	            
  1097	            RMDIR, or its abbreviated form RD, removes a subdirectory
  1098	            from a disk.  Before removing the directory, however, all
  1099	            files in that directory must be deleted with the DEL or
  1100	            ERASE commands.
  1101	            
  1102	            Example:
  1103	            
  1104	            To remove the \WP directory from your hard disk:
  1105	            
  1106	            Enter the following series of commands.
  1107	            
  1108	            CD(sp)\WP<Enter>
  1109	            
  1110	            DEL(sp)*.*<Enter>
  1111	            
  1112	            CD(sp)..<Enter>
  1113	            
  1114	            RMDIR(sp)\WP<Enter>

  1128	
  1129	            CAUTION: Be certain that you really want to delete all the
  1130	            files in that directory.  If there are files you wish to
  1131	            save, COPY them to another directory, or to a floppy disk
  1132	            before deleting them.

  1136	            
  1137	            
  1138	            TYPE is an internal command.
  1139	            
  1140	            Use the TYPE command to view the contents of a file on your
  1141	            monitor.  This command is useful only on ASCII files,
  1142	            meaning files which contain only text.  This excludes all
  1143	            program files, as well as most files created by your word
  1144	            processing program.
  1145	            
  1146	            Example:
  1147	            
  1148	            To see the file AUTOEXEC.BAT on drive A:
  1149	            
  1150	            TYPE(sp)A:AUTOEXEC.BAT<Enter>
  1151	            
  1152	            You can also specify a path for this command.  To see the
  1153	            file LETTER.DOC in the \WP directory on drive C:
  1154	            
  1155	            TYPE(sp)C:\WP\LETTER.DOC<Enter>
  1156	            
  1157	            NOTE:This command will scroll the file on the screen, too
  1158	            fast for you to read.  Special utility programs are
  1159	            available which will let you see the file one screen at a
  1160	            time.  Most of these files are Public Domain programs and
  1161	            are available without charge from Public Domain software
  1162	            suppliers.

  1197	            
  1198	            When you make a mistake when entering a command, or if
  1199	            another type of problem occurs, DOS will place an error
  1200	            message on the screen.  The following are the most common
  1201	            messages you will see.  Suggestions for correcting the error
  1202	            are provided following the message.
  1203	            
  1204	            
  1205	            Bad command or file name
  1206	            
  1207	            DOS cannot find the file or command you entered.  Check your
  1208	            typing and the PATH you have specified for errors.
  1209	            
  1210	            
  1211	            Disk Drive Error: Abort, Ignore, Retry?
  1212	            
  1213	            DOS has detected an error on a disk drive.  Most often, this
  1214	            message appears when you have forgotten to insert a floppy
  1215	            disk into the drive, or have failed to close the door.
  1216	            Correct the problem, then press R for retry.  Pressing A
  1217	            returns you to the system prompt.
  1218	            
  1219	            If this message should appear when you are trying to access
  1220	            your hard disk drive...STOP.  Get help from someone who
  1221	            knows the system well.
  1222	            
  1223	            
  1224	            File cannot be copied onto itself
  1225	            
  1226	            You have tried to copy a file to the same filename on the
  1227	            same drive.  Check your command.
  1228	            
  1229	            
  1230	            File not found
  1231	            
  1232	            DOS can't find the file you specified.  Check your typing
  1233	            and make sure you have given the correct path.
  1234	            
  1235	            
  1236	            Format failure
  1237	            
  1238	            An error has occured when using the FORMAT command.  DOS
  1239	            will provide an explanation with this error message.  Take
  1240	            the appropriate corrective measures.
  1241	            
  1242	            
  1243	            Insufficient disk space
  1244	            
  1245	            The disk you are working with does not have enough space to
  1246	            hold the data.  Replace with a new, formatted disk and
  1247	            repeat the operation.

  1263	            
  1264	            Your computer does not have enough memory for the operation
  1265	            you have named.  Consider expanding your system's memory
  1266	            size.  Memory expansion is relatively inexpensive.

  1271	            The drive name you specified does not exist on your
  1272	            computer. Check your typing.

  1274	            
  1275	            Invalid number of parameters
  1276	            
  1277	            You have mis-typed the command or specified information not
  1278	            acceptable to DOS.  Check the command for errors.
  1279	            
  1280	            
  1281	            There are many other error messages you may see on your
  1282	            screen.  For information on these errors, consult your DOS
  1283	            manual.

  1328	                             WHEN YOUR COMPUTER CRASHES
  1329	                                          
  1330	            No matter how careful you are, there will be times when your
  1331	            computer gets confused.  Usually, when this happens, the
  1332	            keyboard will lock up and nothing you type will have any
  1333	            effect.  Other problems sometimes occur, including a drive
  1334	            that won't stop running.
  1335	            
  1336	            When using commercial software, these problems are
  1337	            infrequent, but do happen from time to time.  Most often,
  1338	            you will lock your system up when experimenting with public
  1339	            domain software, which is less bug-free than most commercial
  1340	            programs.
  1341	            
  1342	            There are four ways to get out of a locked system.  Try
  1343	            these in the order shown below.
  1344	            
  1345	            1. Hold down the <Ctrl> key while you press the <Scroll
  1346	            Lock/Break> key.  This will often get you out of the program
  1347	            and return you to the system prompt.  If it does, you're
  1348	            back in business.
  1349	            
  1350	            2. Press the <Ctrl>, <Alt>, and <Del> keys at the same time.
  1351	            Hold each key down as you press the others. This is called a
  1352	            "warm boot."  It usually does the trick, but wipes out
  1353	            whatever information is stored in your computer's memory.
  1354	            
  1355	            3. Press the <Reset> switch, if your computer has one. This
  1356	            will reboot the computer, wiping out all data in current
  1357	            memory.
  1358	            
  1359	            4. Finally, if none of the other methods work, turn off the
  1360	            computer, wait a few seconds, then turn it back on.  As
  1361	            before, data stored in memory will be lost.  This last
  1362	            method is absolutely guaranteed, however, to restart your
  1363	            system.
