     1	BOSTON, MA (February 11,1992) -- In a review of CD ROM networking
     2	applications in their December 31, 1991 issue, PC Magazine editors awarded
     3	Meridian Data of Scotts Valley, California, their highest award, the PC
     4	Magazine Editors' Choice, for Meridian's CD Net product. In a summary of
     5	their findings, the editors noted that, "Meridian Data offers highly
     6	efficient solutions for networking CD ROM drives...It performed
     7	impressively on our tests."
     8	
     9	"This award is a recognition of over four years of experience in providing
    10	increasingly effective solutions for networking CD ROMs," noted Bill
    11	Etheredge, Meridian's vice president of sales and marketing. "We invented
    12	CD ROM networking and shipped the first system in early 1988. Since then
    13	we've been listening to our customers and adding features to CD Net which
    14	make it the premier product in its class."
    15	
    16	The CD Net line of products offers an intelligent upgrade path with
    17	software and servers that will accommodate an organization's additions of
    18	CD ROM databases to its information sharing, networked environment.
    19	Starting with a software-only product available for $500, the line steps
    20	through eight-drive and fourteen-drive integrated systems. Top of the line
    21	is a twenty-eight drive, 486-based integrated network server for
    22	enterprise-wide CD ROM access.
    23	
    24	Tools for Systems Administrators
    25	
    26	The editors of PC Magazine noted in particular the intelligent tools and
    27	utilities in CD Net Software and Integrated Systems. An example is the CD
    28	Net Application Manager, a tool that configures a menu system that allows
    29	system administrators to set up multiple menu databases and CD ROM access
    30	scripts for automatic mounting and application execution. Quoting from the
    31	review, "This excellent feature, with versatile, system-wide application,
    32	points to one of the strengths of CD Net: It is tailored to the network
    33	administrator." PC Magazine editors found the CD-MENU and CD-ADMIN
    34	functionality unique among the products reviewed.
    35	
    36	The current shipping version of CD Net, 4.2, adds to the reviewed product
    37	with impressive support for the Microsoft Windows 3.0 environment allowing
    38	users to access multiple CD ROM databases from different windows.
    39	
    40	The latest developments for CD Net software have enhanced the system
    41	administration tools, greatly reducing the time involved in setting up
    42	access scripts to multiple CD ROMs in large multiuser environments.
    43	Administrators can copy, merge, and otherwise configure and maintain
    44	multiple application databases.
    45	
    46	All CD Net products are compatible with Novell 286 and 386-based Netware
    47	and also networks from Banyan, IBM, 3Com, AT&T, Artisoft, Microsoft and
    48	Ungermann Bass. With sophisticated SCSI implementation and data caching,
    49	CD Net gives multiple users fast, simultaneous access to all CD ROMs on
    50	the network.
    51	
    52	The Growing Availability of CD ROM Applications
    53	
    54	The value of CD ROM networking grows with the addition of each new
    55	database. The number of CD ROM-based databases has been doubling every
    56	year and analysts expect it to be near 10,000 separate titles at the end
    57	of 1992. A few of the subjects covered by CD ROM-based databases include
    58	vital information in finance, medicine, reference, law, environment,
    59	education, and demographics.
    60	
    61	Meridian's demonstration at Network will show CD ROM Information Centers
    62	for Finance, Legal, Medical and Small Business verticals as well as
    63	powerful CD ROM networking for Enterprise-wide access to CD ROM databases.
    64	Each station will include examples of the valuable information
    65	commercially available today on CD ROM.
    66	
    67	Meridian Data provides network solutions to OEMs and VARs for CD-R,
    68	intelligent network systems for CD ROM-based information, and tools for CD
    69	ROM, CD ROM-XA, CD-I, and CDTV development. Its products are found in
    70	Fortune 1000 companies, universities and government agencies. Meridian
    71	makes available comprehensive support services including consulting,
    72	training, maintenance, and "800" hotline support. Meridian Data sells its
    73	products worldwide through distributors, VARs and direct sales forces and
    74	makes its technology available through OEM, consulting and licensing
    75	relationships with other major vendors.

    78	with offices in Reston, Virginia, Moorestown, New Jersey, and The
