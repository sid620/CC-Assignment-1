     1	Atlanta, GA, February 12, 1992 - LAN users can now reap the benefits of PC
     2	fax technology without fear of incompatibility or obsolescence with
     3	ShareFax 2.5, which started shipping February 11.
     4	
     5	ShareFax 2.5 is the first software to enable DOS and Windows PCs to be
     6	non-dedicated fax servers which work with any LAN operating system running
     7	on ethernet or arcnet cards, and with virtually all faxboards and fax
     8	modems.
     9	
    10	ShareFax 2.5 gives organizations a valuable LAN fax solution while the
    11	industry struggles to define universally acceptable technology standards.
    12	Its ability to run in a nondedicated fashion regardless of LAN environment
    13	or fax device clearly distinguishes ShareFax 2.5 from competitors,
    14	according to SofNet, its Atlanta, GA-based developer.
    15	
    16	SotNet simultaneously addresses the peer-to-peer and small business LAN
    17	markets with new two- and eight-user versions of ShareFax for $149.00 and
    18	$399.00 respectively. This is ideal for companies that spend less than
    19	$500 for a LAN such as LANtastic or NetWare Lite, but who do not want to
    20	buy a fax system that costs more than their LAN.
    21	
    22	Users can load both the Windows and DOS versions of ShareFax 2.5 on the
    23	same LAN so Windows and DOS PCs on that LAN can share the fax server.
    24	ShareFax 2.' runs on any LAN operating system that allows its users to
    25	share a directory.
    26	
    27	ShareFax 2.5's unlimited user version enables any LAN-based PC with a fax
    28	device to be the fax server for however many PCs are on the LAN. It runs
    29	in the background so the server can be a non-dedicated PC which executes
    30	other computing tasks. This is more economical than tying up a PC just for
    31	faxing, or buying a stand-alone fax server hardware system.
    32	
    33	A new ShareFax 2.5 feature enables it to support all Class I and Class 2
    34	fax modems, which represent 95% of the fax modems on the market. This,
    35	along with its ability to support the Hayes-JT Fax modem,
    36	Intel/CAS-compatible fax boards and most proprietary boards, protects
    37	organizations from the adverse effects of fax technology changes.
    38	
    39	ShareFax 2.5 installs automatically, so set up only takes minutes. The DOS
    40	version has new graphical features and a streamlined command structure
    41	which makes it easier to use. Like its Windows' counterpart, the DOS
    42	version enables documents to fax exactly as they appear on the screen,
    43	whereas some PC fax systems transmit text without fonts or other
    44	graphics.
    45	
    46	ShareFax 2.5's command structure is designed so both DOS and Windows users
    47	can fax from their PCs as easily as they print a software document.
    48	ShareFax 2.5 automatically executes the complex software procedures
    49	necessary to communicate with network fax devices.
    50	
    51	Another key new feature enables ShareFax 2.5 users to view, route and print
    52	incoming faxes. ShareFax 2.5 also includes a status log to monitor
    53	out-going and in-coming faxes, multiple phone books for storing fax
    54	numbers and quick dialing, transmission scheduling to send faxes at
    55	optimum times and the ability to fax multiple files to multiple
    56	destinations.
    57	
    58	ShareFax 2.5 for DOS runs on any 8088 through 80486 IBM PC or 100%
    59	compatible with DOS 3.0 or higher. It requires 128K RAM to run in the
    60	foreground, and 18K as a TSR, but users should have 640K total RAM to
    61	allow for their fax board or modem software's memory requirements. The
    62	ShareFax 2.5 Windows version requires Windows 3.0.
    63	
    64	The suggested retail price of unlimited-user version for Windows is
    65	$995.00, and $795 for DOS-only. Users of the limited versions can call
    66	SofNet with their credit card and special ID number to receive a code
    67	which they use to upgrade to additional workstations ($30.00 each for DOS,
    68	$35.00 each for Windows), or to ShareFax's unlimited-user version.
    69	
    70	General Overview - ShareFax 2.5
    71	
    72	ShareFax 2.5 enables any DOS or Windows PC on a LAN to be a non-dedicated
    73	fax server for the other PCs on the network. ShareFax supports an
    74	unlimited number of users and operates with any LAN operating system which
    75	allows all of the network users to share the same file server directory.
    76	The new 2.5 version is compatible with Class land Class 2 modems, as well
    77	as Intel/CAS, Hayes JT and other proprietary fax devices, which
    78	collectively represent over 95% of the PC fax devices currently on the
    79	market..
    80	
    81	Besides giving organizations the flexibility to do network faxing from any
    82	LAN environment and with virtually any network fax system, developer
    83	SofNet streamlined ShareFax's operation to make it easier to use. They
    84	also designed 2-user and 8-user limited versions to better meet the needs
    85	of small peer-to-peer LAN users. Organizations can buy either a DOS-only
    86	version, or a DOS/Windows combination if they have DOS and Windows PCs on
    87	the same LAN.
    88	
    89	ShareFax 2.5 consists of two components.
    90	
    91	The workstation module (MultiFax and XFax for DOS, FaxIt for Windows) picks
    92	up the document(s) to be faxed, automatically converts them to the file
    93	format required by fax devices, then stores them in the shared directory.
    94	Both MultiFax and FaxIt use graphical interfaces, they enable users to
    95	create an unlimited number of "phone books" for storing names and fax
    96	numbers, and they send faxes to multiple destinations. MultiFax also can
    97	fax multiple files. XFax is a utility that uses DOS line commands to do
    98	the same thing as MultiFax. Many experienced DOS users prefer line
    99	commands to graphical interfaces.
   100	
   101	The fax server module runs from the LAN PC on which the faxboard or fax
   102	modem and its software is installed. This portion of ShareFax searches the
   103	shared directory every 2 - 5 seconds for faxes, picks up outbound faxes
   104	and uses one of its three fax drivers designed respectively to communicate
   105	with Intel/CAS, Hayes JT or Class 1 and Class 2 fax devices. The server
   106	portion also picks up incoming faxes and sends them to a LAN administrator
   107	directory located on the server.
   108	
   109	ShareFax 2.5 - easy installation and set up
   110	
   111	Network administrators must be sure all of the LAN PCs, including the one
   112	designated as the fax server, can refer to the shared directory with the
   113	same drive reference and path (e.g. F:\FAXOUT). The LAN PCs must also be
   114	able to create, delete, read from and write to files on this shared
   115	directory. The shared directory will typically be found on the file server
   116	of serverbased LANs. On peer-to-peer LANs, the shared directory can be on
   117	any of the attached PCs.
   118	
   119	A simple "INSTALL" command installs ShareFax's fax server portion on the PC
   120	fax server's hard drive. LAN administrators place MultiFax and XFax on the
   121	shared directory, then create the directories and batch files needed to
   122	run MultiFax as a TSR (Terminate but Stay Resident) or a DOS line
   123	command-driven program. XFax is set up the same way. FaxIt can only be
   124	loaded from ShareFax's Windows disk directly onto each Windows PCs' hard
   125	drives.
   126	
   127	Faxing as easy as printing documents
   128	
   129	MultiFax gives users several graphical formats, including push buttons,
   130	check boxes and radio buttons, to guide them through the process of
   131	sending faxes, checking the fax log for the status of in- and outbound
   132	faxes, creating and using phone books and using the print capture feature.
   133	FaxIt uses the standard Windows graphical features.
   134	
   135	Users access MultiFax from the shared directory through their PCs. The
   136	easiest fax procedure is to set MultiFax to run as a TSR, and turn on its
   137	Print Capture feature. When users are ready to fax, they set the software
   138	application they are running to print to an HP LaserJet printer on LPT3
   139	(the printer port option that people rarely use). The "Print" command
   140	automatically sends the document to MultiFax in HP's .PCL format. When the
   141	document finishes printing, MultiFax pops up to ask users if they want to
   142	print more files. Users can send as many documents to MultiFax as they
   143	want in this manner.
   144	
   145	When users finish printing whatever is to be faxed, MultiFax walks them
   146	through the process of creating cover sheets, determining destinations and
   147	the date and time when faxes should be sent. Hitting the "Send Fax"
   148	command tells MultiFax to take over the faxing process and users can go on
   149	with other work. MultiFax then automatically converts the documents from
   150	.PCL to .PCX format (the format required by all fax devices to be able to
   151	send files) and sends them to the shared directory, where the ShareFax
   152	server module picks the files up and sends them out as soon as possible or
   153	at user-designated times.
   154	
   155	Another procedure users can employ is to turn off Print Capture, but still
   156	run MultiFax as a TSR. When they are ready to fax, users pop up MultiFax,
   157	turn on Print Capture, exit MultiFax, set their document to print to an HP
   158	Laser printer on LPTl(which is where most documents are already set to
   159	print) and hit the "Print" command. The rest of the fax procedure is the
   160	same as with the first option. LAN administrators can determine which
   161	option they want based on the particular needs and skills of their users.
   162	
   163	A third faxing option is to convert files to ASCII or .PCX format (if the
   164	particular application software can do so) and store these files where
   165	users can pick them up with MultiFax at a later time. This is valuable
   166	because users can create documents they send regularly, such as sales
   167	literature, and fax them quickly without having to exit documents to keep
   168	re-entering the commonly faxed documents. However, converting documents to
   169	ASCII format strips them of their graphics and font settings.
   170	
   171	XFax does all of the MultiFax faxing operations through line commands at
   172	the DOS prompt. The ability to specify each ShareFax parameters gives
   173	users greater flexibility in how they use the program. Experienced users
   174	can set up batch files and software shells to use ShareFax in manner most
   175	comfortable to their individual tastes. SofNet provides several prewritten
   176	batch files to further facilitate XFax's use.
   177	
   178	FaxIt, the ShareFax Windows module is even simpler to use than MultiFax.
   179	During installation, users use a command to designate a FaxIt on ShareFax
   180	option be part of Windows' printer setup dialog. When users want to fax a
   181	document, they select the Printer Setup command from any Windows
   182	application, click on FaxIt ShareFax, then print the document as they
   183	normally would.
   184	
   185	FaxIt then works the same as MultiFax, walking users through the various
   186	fax set up options, automatically converting the files to the proper
   187	format with graphics and fonts intact, and sending them to the shared
   188	directory (which is the same directory DOS users access). However, FaxIt
   189	cannot not send multiple files at one time, or send ASCII and .PCX files.
   190	
   191	ShareFax DOS users can create and store any number of custom fax cover
   192	pages, and both DOS and Windows users can store logos in files that can be
   193	merged with the cover pages as faxes are sent.
   194	
   195	Incoming faxes are received at the fax server in the Administration
   196	Directory (created during installation). Anyone who is given
   197	"Administrator" rights can review these faxes with MultiFax, XFax or
   198	FaxIt, and route them to the appropriate people. After individual users
   199	receive faxes at their PCs, they have the option to view them, re-route
   200	faxes to any or all other users, or print the faxes to designated printers
   201	on the LAN. Users can also store faxes on their hard drives.
