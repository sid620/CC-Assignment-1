    16	I have had a few requests to repost my article, so heregoes!
    17	
    18	I would really appreciate it if you sent me your thoughts on this text via
    19	email (to save net bandwidth), and resist the urge to fragment my thoughts
    20	in a followup posting with lots of '>'s. This article is meant to convey one
    21	thought: Cyberspace is NOT hardware. Thanks :-)
    22	
    23	This article originally appeared in the Journal of Computer Game Design last
    24	October, and is positioned as kind of primer. Those of you who received a
    25	copy of this at Hackers 5.0 or read it in alt.cyberspace, hit 'n' now :-).

    28	               Cyberspace: Getting There From Here.
    29	              (c) Copyright 1989 F. Randall Farmer

    31	Randy was lead C64 programmer on the fabled 'Habitat'(1) project 
    32	for Lucasfilm Games. He has taken a hiatus from building Cyberspace 
    33	while he works on a new telecommunications product at AMIX, a 
    34	subsidiary of Autodesk. He can be reached via Usenet as 
    35	randy@xanadu.com or through the Journal BBS.

    37		"Golden Vaporware" is a term I've heard Ted Nelson(2) use to 
    38	describe such exciting computer projects as Xanadu, Dynabook and 
    39	Cyberspace. I understood the term to mean Really-Great-Stuff-That-
    40	People-Are-(Sort-Of)-Working-On-And-Never-Ship.  But now, it 
    41	seems,  "The Age Of Golden Vaporware" has arrived. Ted's Xanadu 
    42	project is now well under way and should ship product in '90.  There 
    43	is a company called Dynabook Technologies that has released "step 2" 
    44	of the "20 steps"(3) to Alan Kay's vision of the ultimate laptop.  And 
    45	Cyberspace has been prototyped by QuantumLink and Lucasfilm.
    46	
    47		These projects are likely to succeed not because they are 
    48	exciting to us techie-geeks, but because they have solid commercial 
    49	and technical foundations.  Here I will illustrate a path from current 
    50	software and hardware technologies to the Cyberspace that many of 
    51	us have dreamed of for almost 20 years.
    52	
    53	
    54	What is Cyberspace anyway?
    55	
    56		"Cyberspace" is a fuzzily defined word that has been in the 
    57	press a lot recently(4)(at least in Silicon Valley).  Vernor Vinge first 
    58	described a vision of what might now be called Cyberspace in his 
    59	novella True Names(5). The hero of Vinges's story connected to "The 
    60	Other Plane" using EEG electrodes placed on the forehead. The Other 
    61	Plane was a place where complicated software systems were 
    62	represented by familiar objects.  The Max Headroom television show 
    63	used similar representations in various episodes.  Other fictional 
    64	treatments include William Gibson's Neuromancer (6), which has 
    65	been turned into a popular graphic adventure, and other 
    66	"Cyberpunk" novels. Here the vision of Cyberspace is based around 
    67	commercial and governmental network computer access, where 
    68	"cowboys" and "wizards" break in and wreak fiscal havoc. In these 
    69	works, Cyberspace is a metaphor for abstract concepts.
    70	
    71		Autodesk, maker of the best selling AutoCAD system, has 
    72	thrown its hat into the Cyberspace ring where it joins VPL's Jaron 
    73	Lanier and NASA-AMES. All of these products share similar base 
    74	technologies and assumptions: two head-mounted TV monitors for 
    75	stereo imaging, a powerful computer, and a 3D input device like 
    76	VPL's DataGlove. They are primarily single user systems, and, in the 
    77	case of at least Autodesk's product, probably aimed at CAD users who 
    78	want to edit drawings in three dimensions. There are many other 
    79	applications, but discussion is beyond the scope of this article. The 
    80	key to all of these systems is enough computer power to do  double-
    81	buffered stereoscopic real-time graphics at a high frame rate (say 
    82	20-30 frames/second). This technology is expensive: in the case of 
    83	VPL's "virtual reality" system (their special two user version) the 
    84	price tag weighs in at $69,925. The "Eyephones" cost $9,400 and the 
    85	glove $8,800.(7) These companies envision Cyberspace as a new kind 
    86	of user interface.
    87	
    88		To me, Cyberspace is a place, not just an interface or a 
    89	metaphor. A place where people, regardless of location, hardware, or 
    90	purpose can get together in a participatory experience to conduct 
    91	business, socialize, or have a good game of SpaceCombat9.6.
    92	
    93		Why this vision instead of the others?  People.  Unlike the 
    94	interactions with artificial personalities created for computer 
    95	adventure games, Cyberspace interactions could create relationships 
    96	that are "greater than the sum of their parts".  Here the consequences 
    97	of individual actions take on a greater significance because they 
    98	affect the world of, and the personal belongings of the other 
    99	participants.  Because Cyberspace will be so malleable,  each 
   100	individual can "make a dent"(8) and participate in its ongoing 
   101	creation and adaptation.
   102	
   103		This is not speculation! During Habitat's beta test, several social 
   104	institutions sprang up spontaneously: There were marriages and 
   105	divorces, a church (complete with a real-world Greek Orthodox 
   106	minister), a loose guild of thieves, an elected sheriff (to combat the 
   107	thieves), a  newspaper (with a rather eccentric editor), and before 
   108	long two lawyers hung up their shingle to sort out claims.  And this 
   109	was with only about 150 people! My vision encompasses tens of 
   110	thousands of simultaneous participants.
   111	
   112	
   113	How can it work?
   114		There are several major problems facing a large-scale 
   115	Cyberspace system: Bandwidth, Graphic Resolution, User Interface 
   116	Standards, Event Integrity, Data Communications Standards, and 
   117	Computer Horsepower.
   118	
   119		Bandwidth is the most overrated problem. Everybody thinks 
   120	you need to send megabytes of data every minute to each user in 
   121	order to make Cyberspace work. This is simply not true. Habitat 
   122	works at a mere 300 baud. The keys to keeping bandwidth down are 
   123	distributed processing (having the local computer do most of the 
   124	display and interface work), object oriented command messages, and 
   125	avoiding communication intensive graphics primitives (such as those 
   126	associated with NAPLPS, that slower-than-molasses protocol they use 
   127	for Prodigy and other Videotex systems).
   128	
   129		Graphic Resolution, User Interface and Local Horsepower issues 
   130	should all be lumped together.  To be viable over time, Cyberspace 
   131	must be designed with the "to each according to his abilities" 
   132	principle. If a C64 with NTSC TV and joystick-only interface 
   133	encounters a 60 megahertz 486 user with Eyephones and DataGlove, 
   134	the interaction should be filtered so that each user can have a 
   135	satisfying experience (e.g the C64 user doesn't see all the intricate 
   136	detail the 486er has put into his attire, and all people walk exactly 
   137	the same, but they can still sit, chat, and play a nice game of 
   138	Strattagema.)
   139	
   140		Event Integrity is a side effect of distributed processing. Simply 
   141	put: you can't trust the home computer. Hackers have all the time in 
   142	the world to crack the software and make it send messages it 
   143	shouldn't. This is akin to the long debated copy protection problem, 
   144	but comes with its own unique solution: The Host. Since the host is 
   145	the final arbiter of all events, it should be programmed at a very 
   146	high level to reject bad messages.
   147	
   148		Data Communications Standards are key to the future viability 
   149	of Cyberspace. A protocol is required that is efficient and forward 
   150	looking,  with hooks for future revisions (as bandwith increases) and 
   151	data encryption. Anything that is going to be used for business will 
   152	need to transmit its data securely for protection against espionage.  
   153	Also, the standard needs to address such issues as Email and  
   154	gateways to those entrenched text-only systems.  I want to read my 
   155	Usenet mail printed on a sheet of paper in my Cyberhand!
   156	
   157		Since the host coordinates all activity for all users, Host 
   158	Horsepower is by far the most critical issue. For the first few years of 
   159	operations, Cyberspace will have a single centralized host consisting 
   160	of several connected multi-processing computers.  In order to keep 
   161	overhead to a minimum, bandwidth and database access will need to 
   162	be tightly limited.  The communications protocol will need to be 
   163	super efficient and messages must be kept tiny.  Eventually there 
   164	will be several independent Cyberspaces, perhaps on LANs or a 
   165	larger BBS. Of course, while you are walking around in your office 
   166	Cyberspace, you might want to go to other Cyberspaces, so a 
   167	distributed host model will need to be designed.  By not having a 
   168	central host keep track of everything and everyone, this distributed 
   169	model will actually decrease the load on each host. This will allow 
   170	Cyberspace to take on a few interesting features: 1) Each host can be 
   171	a different kind of place, with different 'rules' (e.g. A role-playing 
   172	Cyberhost would probably have monsters, combat rules -including 
   173	character death- and a no-holds-barred policy about participant 
   174	behavior whereas an office Cyberhost would have access protection 
   175	and wouldn't allow personal combat of any type), 2) Increased 
   176	capacity without loss of access, and 3) Faster growth.
   177	
   178	When will it happen?
   179	
   180		Rather than pin a date on my Cyberverse, I will outline a 
   181	possible implementation path, including all of the developments 
   182	publicly announced to date.

   251	
   252	Farmer, you're full of Cybercrud!(10)
   253	
   254		Oh, yeah? A 386/CDROM version of Habitat will soon be 
   255	released in Japan.  Other foreign companies are also interested in this 
   256	technology, and some are talking about multi-machine support, 
   257	standards, and the future.  My only fear is that the long-term nature 
   258	of this project will cause American companies to shy away, and let 
   259	yet another new technology be monopolized by other, more forward-
   260	looking nations.

   293	Well, there you have it, my first published article :-). All comments welcome.
   294	
   295	Don't pay too much attention to the timeline, it's meant mostly to point
   296	out that there are no real technical barriers to this vision, and the future
   297	should only see the kind of improvments we've seen with computers: Faster,
   298	Bigger, and more Resolution.
