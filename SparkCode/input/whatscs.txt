     6	WHAT IS [7mCYBERSPACE[m?
     7	Introduction
     8	In a recent issue of the Computer Law & Security Report [1], Bernard Zajac
     9	suggested that readers might want to peruse some of the "cyberpunk"
    10	novels-in particular the works of William Gibson-in order to gain an
    11	insight into the organisation and behaviour of hackers.  While wholly
    12	commending the incitement to read Gibson's work, we feel that this view
    13	understates the breadth of vision of the cyberpunk genre and could mislead,
    14	because the "console men" and "keyboard cowboys" of Gibson's works are not
    15	really the same people as the hackers of today.
    16	We thought it might therefore be both entertaining and stimulating to
    17	provide readers with an overview of the world of [7mcyberspace[m and to draw
    18	attention to some elements of the works where we feel that there are indeed
    19	some points worth further analysis and discussion.  Is it possible that,
    20	like Arthur C. Clarke's much vaunted prediction of the communication
    21	satellite [2], Gibson has produced works which are not so much science
    22	fiction as informed prediction?
    23	Gibson is not the only cyberpunk author, but he has become probably the
    24	most well-known.  Essential reading includes his books Count Zero [3],
    25	Neuromancer [4], Burning Chrome [5] and Mona Lisa Overdrive [6].  For
    26	readers new to the subject, Mirroshades  [7] is an excellent anthology of
    27	cyberpunk short stories which gives an overview of the spectrum of
    28	cyberpunk writing.
    29	[7mCyberspace[m
    30	Description
    31	[7mCyberspace[m is an extension of the idea of virtual reality.  Instead of
    32	seeing computer data converted into pictures that come from human
    33	experience (as in a flight simulator), or extensions from human experience
    34	(such as the "desktop" metaphor used with personal computers), [7mcyberspace[m
    35	comprises computers, telecommunications, software and data in a more
    36	abstract form.  At the core of [7mcyberspace[m is the matrix or the Net:
    37	"The Net... joins all of the computers and telephones on Earth.  It is
    38	formed by radio, telepho and cellular links with microwave transmitters
    39	beaming information into orbit and beyond.  In the 20th century, the Net
    40	was only accessible via a computer terminal, using a device called a modem
    41	to send and receive information.  But in 2013, the Net can be entered
    42	directly using your own brain, neural plugs and complex interface programs
    43	that turn computer data into perceptual events" View From the Edge, [8].
    44	In several places, reference is made to the military origin of the
    45	[7mcyberspace[m interfaces:
    46	 "You're a console cowboy.  The prototypes of the programs you use to crack
    47	industrial banks were developed for [a military operation].  For the
    48	assault on the Kirensk computer nexus.  Basic module was a Nightwing
    49	microlight, a pilot, a matrix deck, a jockey.  We were running a virus
    50	called Mole.  The Mole series was the first generation of real intrusion
    51	programs." Neuromancer, [4].
    52	"The matrix has its roots in primitive arcade games... early graphics
    53	programs and military experimentation with cranial jack" Neuromancer, [4].
    54	Gibson also assumes that in addition to being able to "jack in" to the
    55	matrix, you can go through the matrix to jack in to another person using a
    56	"simstim" deck.  Using the simstim deck, you experience everything that the
    57	person you are connected to experiences:
    58	"Case hit the simstim switch.  And flipped in to the agony of a broken
    59	bone.  Molly was braced against the blank grey wall of a long corridor, her
    60	breath coming ragged and uneven.  Case was back in the matrix instantly, a
    61	white-hot line of pain fading in his left thigh." Neuromancer, [4].
    62	The matrix can be a very dangerous place.  As your brain is connected in,
    63	should your interface program be altered, you will suffer.  If your program
    64	is deleted, you would die.  One of the characters in Neuromancer is called
    65	the Dixie Flatline, so named because he has survived deletion in the
    66	matrix.  He is revered as a hero of the cyber jockeys:
    67	"'Well, if we can get the Flatline, we're home free.  He was the best.  You
    68	know he died braindeath three times.'  She nodded.  'Flatlined on his EEG.  Showed me the tapes.'" Neuromancer, [4].
    69	Incidentally, the Flatline doesn't exist as a person any more:  his mind
    70	has been stored in a RAM chip which can be connected to the matrix.
    71	Operation
    72	So how does [7mcyberspace[m work?  As noted previously, you connect to the
    73	matrix through a deck which runs an interface program:
    74	"A silver tide of phosphenes boiled across my field of vision as the matrix
    75	began to unfold in my head, a 3-D chessboard, infinite and perfectly
    76	transparent.  The Russian program seemed to lurch as we entered the grid. 
    77	If anyone else had been jacked in to that part of the matrix, he might have
    78	seen a surf of flickering shadow ride out of the little yellow pyramid that
    79	represented our computer." Burning Chrome, [5].
    80	"Tick executed the transit in real time, rather than the bodyless,
    81	instantaneous shifts ordinarily employed in the matrix.  The yellow plain,
    82	he explained, roofed the London Stock Exchange and related City entities...
    83	'Th's White's,' Tick was saying, directing her attention to a modest grey
    84	pyramid, 'the club in St. James'.  Membership directory, waiting list..."
    85	Mona Lisa Overdrive, [6].
    86	Is this view of operating computers and communications networks by moving
    87	around inn ethereal machine-generated world really that far-fetched?  When
    88	the first virtual reality (VR) units for personal computers will probably
    89	be in the shops by next Christmas?  If you still think that VR is science
    90	fiction, note that British television viewers will shortly be tuning in to
    91	a new game show (called "CyberZone") where the digital images of teams of
    92	players equipped with VR helmets, power gloves and pressure pads will fight
    93	it out in a computer-generated world (built using 16 IBM PCs fronting an
    94	ICL master computer).
    95	Cyber World
    96	Organisation
    97	The world of cyberpunk is near future (say, 50 years at the maximum) Earth.
    98	 Nation states and their governments are unimportant and largely
    99	irrelevant.  The world is run by giant Japanese-American-European
   100	multinational conglomerates, the zaibatsu.  Gibson frequently uses Japanese
   101	words and Japanese slang to reinforce the expanding role of Japan in the
   102	world and in society.  In the same way that business has agglomerated on a
   103	global scale, the mafia have merged with the Japanese gangs, the yakuza. 
   104	The zaibatsu are in constant conflict and the yakuza are their agents:
   105	"Business has no stake in any political system per se.  Business
   106	co-operates to the extent that co-operation furthers its own interests. 
   107	And the primary interest of business is growth and dominance.  Once the
   108	establishment of Free Enterprise Zones freed corporations from all
   109	constraints, they reverted to a primal struggle, which continues to this
   110	day." Stone Lives, [9].
   111	Far fetched?  Again, not really.  Even as we sat down to write this
   112	article, the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of Nomura (the world's largest
   113	financial institution) were resigning because of their links with organised
   114	crime: 
   115	"Sceptics say that four decades of accommodation between police,
   116	politicians and yakuza will not be overturned simply by new legislation. 
   117	There are believed to be almost 100,000 full-time gangsters in Japan, a
   118	quarter of whom belong to the Yamaguchi-Gumi, a mammoth organisation with
   119	900 affiliates and a portfolio of operations ranging from prostitution,
   120	drugs and share speculation to run-of-the mill protection rackets" [10].
   121	Herein lies a major feature of Gibson's books.  The cyber jockeys are not
   122	student pranksters or teenage hackers messing about with other peoples'
   123	computers for fun or mischief (The Lord of the Files, [11]):  by and large
   124	they are either working for the zaibatsu or the yakuza and their (for
   125	profit) activities revolve around industrial espionage and sabotage.
   126	Information
   127	A fundamental theme running through most cyberpunk literature is that (in
   128	the near future Earth) commodities are unimportant.  Since anything can be
   129	manufactured, very cheaply, manufactured goods (and the commodities that
   130	are needed to create them) are no longer central to economic life.  The
   131	only real commodity is information.  In fact, in many ways, the zaibatsu are the information that they
   132	own:
   133	"But weren't the zaibatsu more like that, or the yakuza, hives with
   134	cybernetic memories, vast single organisms with their DNA coded in
   135	silicon?" Neuromancer, [4].
   136	Naturally, with information so vital, the zaibatsu go to great lengths to
   137	protect their data.  In Johnny Mnemonic, one of Gibson's short stories, the
   138	eponymous "hero" has data hidden in his own memory to keep it safe from the
   139	yakuza:
   140	"The stored data are fed in through a series of microsurgical contraautism
   141	prostheses.'  I reeled off a numb version of my standard sales pitch. 
   142	'Client's code is stored in a special chip... Can't drug it out, cut it
   143	out, rture it out.  I don't know it, never did." Johnny Mnemonic, [12].
   144	With information so fundamental to the business world, the mechanics of
   145	business are vastly different from those we know at present.  In our
   146	current product- and service-based business world, we are used to dealing
   147	with items that can be stamped, traced, taxed, counted and measured.  When
   148	the primary commodity is information, these attributes no longer apply and
   149	the structure of the business world is different.  This has already been
   150	recognised by many people, including the well-known management consultant
   151	Peter Drucker [13]:
   152	"So far most computer users still use the new technology only to do faster
   153	what they have done before, crunch conventional numbers.  But as soon as a
   154	company takes the first tentative steps from data to information, its
   155	decision processes, management structure and even the way it gets its work
   156	done begin to be transformed."
   157	Net Running
   158	Hacking is too trivial and undescriptive a term to use for the unauthorised
   159	and illegal activities of the cyber jockeys in [7mcyberspace[m.  A much better
   160	terms is "Net running".
   161	"They found their 'paradise'... on the jumbled border of a low security
   162	academic grid.  At first glance it resembled the kind of graffiti student
   163	operators somimes left at the junction of grid lines, faint glyphs of
   164	coloured light that shimmered against the confused outlines of a dozen arts
   165	faculties.  'There,' said the Flatline.  'the blue one.  Make it out? 
   166	That's an entry code for Bell Europa.  Fresh, too." Neuromancer, [4].
   167	Everywhere in the Net, there is "ice".  Ice is security countermeasures
   168	software.  The Net runners spend most of their time in the matrix
   169	encountering, evaluating and evading these countermeasures.  The encounters
   170	with ice are brilliantly described in many of Gibson's books:
   171	"We've crashed her gates disguised as an audit and three subpoenas, but her
   172	[the organisation being attacked] defences are specifically geared to deal
   173	with that kind of intrusion.  Her most sophisticated ice is structured to
   174	fend off writs, warrants, subpoenas.  When we breached the first gate, the
   175	bulk of her data vanished behind core command ice... Five separate
   176	landlines spurted May Day signals to law firms, but the virus had already
   177	taken over the parameter e...  The Russian program lifts a Tokyo number
   178	from unscreened data, choosing it for frequency of calls, average length of
   179	calls, the speed with which [the organisation] returned those calls. 
   180	'Okay,' says Bobby, 'we're an incoming scrambler call from a l of hers in
   181	Tokyo.  That should help.'  Ride 'em cowboy." Burning Chrome, [14].
   182	The best ice contains elements of artificial intelligence (AI):
   183	"'That's it huh?  Big green rectangle off left?'  'You got it.  Corporate
   184	core data for [another organisation] and that ice is generated by their two
   185	friendly AIs.  On par with anything in the military sector, looks to me. 
   186	That's king hell ice, Case, black as the grave and slick as glass.  Fry
   187	your brains as soon as look at you." Neuromancer, [4].
   188	These descriptions cannot be seen as predictions:  they are just
   189	straightforward extrapolations based on current technology and trends.
   190	Predictions
   191	So what are the core "predictions" of cyberpunk and do they have relevance
   192	to security strategies today?
   193	Computer and communications technology is already at a point where the Net
   194	is only a few years away.  Charles L. Brown, the CEO of AT&T, put it like this:
   195	"The phone system, when coupled with computer technology, permits a person
   196	almost anywhere to plug in to a world library of information... Just around
   197	the bend is an information network that would increase the range of
   198	perception of a single individual to include all of the information
   199	available anywhere in the network's universe." [15].
   200	The development of the corrate world so that information becomes the
   201	primary commodity is already underway.  This does have implications for
   202	planning, because too many existing risk management policies are
   203	asset-based.  As it is easier to value a computer than value the
   204	information it holds, too much effort has gone into valuing and protecting
   205	physical assets rather than information assets.  Already, there is a good
   206	argument for saying that the information assets are the key [16]:
   207	"A new concept of business is taking shape in response to the info-wars now
   208	raging across the world economy.  As knowledge becomes more central to the
   209	creation of wealth, we begin to think of the corporation as an enhancer of
   210	knowledge."
   211	How will the information assets be valued?  How will the world of mergers
   212	and acquisitions deal with the problem of rate of return on "intangible"
   213	assets.  An interesting parallel can be drawn with the relatively recent
   214	attempts to value brand names and include the brand names as assets on
   215	balance sheets.
   216	The legal sector is probably even further behind than the security sector. 
   217	With the legal system already struggling to catch up with the developments
   218	in computer and communications technology, it is hard to imagine how it
   219	could come to terms with [7mcyberspace[m:
   220	"As communications and data processing technology continues to advance at a
   221	pace many times faster than society can assimilate it, additional conflicts
   222	have begun to occur on the border between [7mcyberspace[m and the physical
   223	world." [17].
   224	In fact, these conflicts are already causing many problems as evidenced by
   225	recent events and court cases in the U.S. [18]:
   226	"Do electronic bulletin boards that may list stolen access codes enjoy
   227	protection under the First Amendment?"
   228	"How can privacy be ensured when computers record every phone call, cash
   229	withdrawal and credit-card transaction.  What "property rights" can be
   230	protected in digital electronic systems that can create copies that are
   231	indistinguishable from the real thing."
   232	" Ten months after the Secret Service shut down the [electronics bulletin
   233	boards], the Government still has not produced any indictments.  And
   234	several similar cases that have come before the courts have been badly
   235	flawed.  One Austin-based game publisher whose bulletin board system was
   236	seized last March is expected soon to sue the Government for violating his
   237	civil liberties."
   238	Summary
   239	We hope that this brief overview of the world of cyberpunk has done justice
   240	to the excellent books from which we have quoted and encouraged some
   241	readers to dip into the collection.
   242	So is Gibson's work an example of a science fiction prediction that will
   243	prove to be as accurate as Clarke's prediction of the communications
   244	satellite?  Not really:  the world that Gibson writes about is more a well
   245	thought out extension of the situation at present than a radical
   246	prediction.  After all, as Gordon Gekko (the character played by Michael
   247	Douglas) says in the film Wall Street, "The most valuable commodity I know
   248	of is information.  Wouldn't you agree?"
