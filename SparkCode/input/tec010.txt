    10	STACKER's software version is supplemented and enhanced by the
    11	coprocessor card.  The STACKER coprocessor card yields the highest
    12	compression of data, the smallest device driver and the fastest I/O.
    13	
    14	Note: For a coprocessor install checklist, see tech008.
    15	
    16	Q: What types of performance increases will I see with the
    17	   coprocessor ?
    18	A: 1. Hardware compression offers as much as 10-20% more disk
    19	      space;
    20	   2. Disk reads and writes are 5-15% faster;
    21	   3. The higher performance is especially apparent on slower
    22	      machines.
    23	   4. The device driver memory requirements with the card are
    24	      as little as 14k vs. 26k for the software version.
    25	
    26	Q: What is the difference between the XT/8 coprocessor and the
    27	   AT/16 ?
    28	A: 1. The AT/16 is a 16 bit card designed for At class
    29	      machines such as 286, 386 and 486s.  The XT/8 is an 8 bit card 
    30	      designed for XT class machines.
    31	   2. The AT/16 uses an I/O address whereas the XT/8 requires a 16 K 
    32	      upper memory address.  Note: on 386/486 machines, the XT/8
    33	      requires its 16K upper memory range to be excluded from use 
    34	      by memory managers.  Neither card requires an IRQ.
    35	   3. Both coprocessors incorporate the same compression chip so 
    36	      they will achieve the same amount of compression.
    37	
    38	Q: What if some hardware conflict prevents the coprocessor from
    39	   functioning ?
    40	A: If the coprocessor card does not install correctly or load at
    41	   boot time, STACKER will still run ("Coprocessor card not
    42	   functioning--invoking software driver") and data will still be
    43	   both compressed and accessible.  You would just be operating
    44	   without the benefits of the card.
    45	
    46	*Upgrading to the coprocessor version from software only:*
    47	
    48	Upgrading from the software to the coprocessor version does not
    49	require re-installing STACKER.  However, only those files written
    50	to the drive with the coprocessor benefit from the higher
    51	compression.  With version 2.0, the files can be recompressed
    52	using SDEFRAG with the /R parameter.  Recompressing the files
    53	under version 1.x requires that the files be reloaded into the
    54	Stacker drive.
