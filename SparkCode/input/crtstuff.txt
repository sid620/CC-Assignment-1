    21	
    22	        I remember those simple days not so long ago when a purchaser of
    23	        a brand new IBM Personal Computer had only one choice to make
    24	        when it came to choosing the display system for his computer.
    25	        Blessedly, the only choice to be made back then was between
    26	        either a monochrome display and adpater, the so-called MDA
    27	        solution, or a color screen and adapter, and CGA route. Needless
    28	        to say, things are not so simple or straightforward these days!
    29	        There are so many choices and options open to a purchaser or
    30	        upgrader of a PC that I'd be crazy to even ATTEMPT to offer any
    31	        clarification or guidance.
    32	
    33	        Okay, so call me crazy. It's time to choose the display
    34	        subsystem for Steve's Dream Machine and I've got some real
    35	        surprises in store for you this time! I've spent most of the
    36	        past six weeks (when I haven't been reconfiguring my system
    37	        between VM/386, Desqview, and Omniview) researching, probing,
    38	        and digging for the best possible contemporary display solution
    39	        for the least possible money.
    40	
    41	        Surprisingly, my research has uncovered some truly startling
    42	        facts which I'll be sharing through the next few weeks as we
    43	        explore THE DISPLAY SYSTEM FOR STEVE'S DREAM MACHINE. We'll see
    44	        things like why the new 16-bit display adapters are generally
    45	        not worth a dime more than their older 8-bit predecessors, how
    46	        few, if any, VGA adapters on the market are REALLY register
    47	        level compatible, and what risk that represents in light of
    48	        IBM's unknowable future plans. We'll see what extra display
    49	        memory DOESN'T buy for you because many of the manufacturer's
    50	        device drivers don't even use it, why the highest resolution
    51	        modes can be much more trouble than they're worth, and what NOT
    52	        to pay for a great high resolution display.
    53	
    54	        Given the incredible variety of available choices (not at all
    55	        like in the old days) it may surprise you to know that I have
    56	        found ONE set of choices which delivers far more bang for the
    57	        buck than any other! In order to give these conclusions a proper
    58	        perspective, let's first step back for a moment to review the
    59	        technological fundamentals and constraints which give our
    60	        decision meaning. Then we'll see where we've been and where
    61	        we're going.
    62	
    63	        No matter what style of display screen and interface adapter is
    64	        in use, several fundamentals always apply. In the first place,
    65	        the image displayed by a CRT screen is not at all the static
    66	        image which it appears to be. In fact, there's never really an
    67	        image being displayed on the screen at all! If you were to
    68	        photograph a computer display screen with a high speed camera
    69	        you'd only see a single bright dot of light rather than an
    70	        entire image.
    71	
    72	        The illusion of a screen full of information is created with the
    73	        aid of some incredible technology. The screen is actually
    74	        painted by a single madly whizzing dot of light which traces
    75	        successive horizontal lines across and down the face of the
    76	        display tube. When I say "madly whizzing" I'm not exaggerating
    77	        because a typical CRT screen paints horizontal scan lines on its
    78	        face at the rate of 350,000 inches per second, which is 20,000
    79	        miles per hour! This furious speed is required in order to fool
    80	        our eyes into believing that the entire image is being
    81	        continuously displayed when in fact it's mostly NOT being
    82	        displayed!
    83	
    84	        A typical display screen consists of about 450 of these
    85	        horizontally scanned lines, each of which must be redrawn or
    86	        "refreshed" at least every sixtieth of a second. This means
    87	        scanning across 27,000 lines per second, every second. If this
    88	        is not done our eye will perceive that the lines are not being
    89	        continuously illuminated and the illusion we've tried so hard to
    90	        achieve will fail.
    91	
    92	        As the single dot of light traces its furious course it changes
    93	        color thus tracing out the full screen image which is stored in
    94	        the display adapter's DISPLAY REFRESH MEMORY. On a monochrome
    95	        screen which is limited to displaying a single color, the dot of
    96	        light varies in brightness only, whereas a color display system
    97	        allows the dot's instantaneous color to be varied as well.
    98	
    99	        So we're left with a number of important concepts: In order to
   100	        eliminate the overall "refresh flicker" of a display screen, the
   101	        entire screen must be redrawn or repainted approximately 60
   102	        times each second. Since the scanning dot traces lines from left
   103	        to right as it moves more slowly vertically from the top of the
   104	        screen down, the downward motion is referred to as the screen's
   105	        Vertical Refresh Frequency and the very rapid horizontal left to
   106	        right scanning is referred to as the display's Horizontal
   107	        Refresh Rate.
   108	
   109	
   110	                     The Display System Adventure Continues
   111	
   112	
   113	        So we've seen that the display screens of our computers rely
   114	        entirely upon our eye's persistence of vision to assemble the
   115	        illusion of an image on the screen. Each dot which composes the
   116	        display must be redrawn, or refreshed, at least sixty times each
   117	        second in order to appear continuously illuminated. Now we'll
   118	        examine the evolution of our display screens, giving some
   119	        perspective to where we've been and where we are today.
   120	
   121	        The original Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) traces its ancestry
   122	        directly from commercial television. Commercial TV refreshes its
   123	        screen exactly 60 times per second with a horizontal scanning
   124	        frequency of 15,750 cycles per second. The IBM CGA display
   125	        utilizes this timing to support the images it generates. The
   126	        total number of horizontal scanning lines traced onto the screen
   127	        by a CGA system can be determined simply by calculating how many
   128	        horizontal lines are scanned out during one vertical scan. Since
   129	        the screen is scanned vertically 60 times per second, we divide
   130	        15,750 by 60 to yield the horizontal line count of 262. Two
   131	        hundred of these scan lines are used to display actual image
   132	        data, with the balance used to illuminate the CGA screen's border
   133	        region.
   134	
   135	        As we all remember, the CGA was not known for producing highly
   136	        legible text (for some it's not yet a memory). The prime
   137	        determiner of text quality is the number of individual pixel
   138	        dots which are available to display individual characters.
   139	        Dividing 200 total image lines by 25 lines of text yields just 8
   140	        scanning lines available per text line. Then since the CGA
   141	        adapter was able to display 640 dots across a horizontal line,
   142	        dividing this by 80 characters per line yields 8 pixel dots
   143	        horizontally per character.
   144	
   145	        So CGA technology yielded a budget of 8 by 8 pixels per
   146	        character. Since it is necessary to separate characters by at
   147	        least one blank pixel, and since characters are taller than they
   148	        are wide, CGA characters were designed to fit within a rectangle
   149	        of dots 5 wide by 7 dots high. If you have a few moments to
   150	        spare some time with some graph paper, try designing an entire
   151	        upper and lower case alphabet where each character fits within a
   152	        5 by 7 pixel cell. It's not simple, and there is no really great
   153	        solution.
   154	
   155	        Driven by the concern that serious business computer users would
   156	        be very unhappy with the appearance of CGA text, IBM decided to
   157	        provide a better text display alternative. The Monochrome
   158	        Display Adapter (MDA) was the result. In order to deliver more
   159	        legible characters, more pixels are required both horizontally
   160	        and vertically. Where the CGA fits 5 by 7 characters into 8 by 8
   161	        "cells," the IBM monochrome display provides much higher
   162	        resolution: 7 by 9 characters within a 9 by 14 space.
   163	
   164	        Changing the character resolution from 5 by 7 to 7 by 9 results
   165	        in a tremendous improvement in character legibility, and a 2-
   166	        pixel horizontal inter-character spacing with a 5-pixel vertical
   167	        spacing leaves the display's characters feeling quite uncrowded.
   168	
   169	        The question is, where did IBM get all those extra scan-lines?
   170	        25 lines of text with 14 scan-lines per line means a total of
   171	        350 active scan lines compared to the CGA's 200! The scan-line
   172	        count can be increased by increasing the horizontal scan
   173	        frequency so that more lines are scanned per second, or by
   174	        decreasing the overall vertical refresh rate thus allowing more
   175	        time to scan the horizontal lines.
   176	
   177	        IBM did both of these things to create the MDA standard. The MDA
   178	        refreshes its screen at only 50 cycles per second with a
   179	        horizontal scan rate of 18,432 hertz. Now, dividing 18,432 by 50
   180	        yields about 368 scan lines. Since 350 of these are required for
   181	        text display, the MDA is not able to display a border.
   182	
   183	        But how can IBM refresh the MDA screen at only 50 cycles per
   184	        second if we begin noticing a flicker as refresh frequencies
   185	        fall below 60 cycles per second? IBM compensated for our lack of
   186	        vision persistence by designing a highly persistent green
   187	        phosphor into their monochrome display. Many people immediately
   188	        noticed a "smeary" effect whenever the IBM monochrome display
   189	        scrolled text. This smearing was created by the use of a long
   190	        persistence phosphor which continued to glow long after the
   191	        screen's electron beam stopped refreshing the region.
   192	
   193	        If you've ever noticed an annoying continuous flicker from an
   194	        inexpensive clone monochrome display, now you know why. Most
   195	        clone monochrome displays use less expensive standard short or
   196	        medium-length phosphors... which are inadequate for masking the
   197	        very noticeable effects of the MDA's lower refresh rate. Also,
   198	        since the flicker-perception phenomenon is extremely subjective,
   199	        many people perceive flicker where others don't. I've
   200	        learned that I don't see flicker where other people are being
   201	        driven nuts by it.
   202	
   203	        With an understanding of the interactions of horizontal and
   204	        vertical scan rates and display resolution we're ready to
   205	        explore the EGA, VGA and multisync technologies.
   206	
   207	
   208	                         The role of Hercules Graphics,
   209	                          and the evolution of the EGA
   210	
   211	
   212	        We've seen how IBM designed their MDA monochrome display system
   213	        to deliver extremely well-formed characters by increasing the
   214	        display's horizontal scanning rate and decreasing the vertical
   215	        refresh rate. Before continuing our discussion of EGA, VGA, and
   216	        multisynchronous monitors, it's important to understand another
   217	        quite well established and significant display standard,
   218	        Hercules.
   219	
   220	        Perhaps IBM simply overlooked the idea of monochrome graphics
   221	        altogether, or underestimated the demand for the display of
   222	        graphic information. More likely though, IBM felt that the word-
   223	        processing market toward which they were targeting their
   224	        monochrome display system had no need to display graphics. How
   225	        could IBM, or anyone for that matter, have anticipated the
   226	        phenomenal effect Lotus' 123 spreadsheet product would have upon
   227	        the IBM compatible market?
   228	
   229	        While columns of numbers are indeed informative, the ability to
   230	        graphically display, correlate, and view the results of
   231	        spreadsheet calculations is extremely useful. The folks at
   232	        Hercules Computer quickly recognized this and designed a
   233	        wonderful solution which, with the early support of Lotus, became
   234	        a solid standard.
   235	
   236	        Since the Hercules high resolution mode was designed to operate
   237	        with an IBM or compatible monochrome monitor, at a horizontal
   238	        sweep rate of 18,432 cycles per second and a refresh frequency
   239	        of (only) 50 hertz, it could directly leverage the extremely
   240	        high resolution which IBM had designed into their monochrome
   241	        text system. The Hercules monochrome display resolution of 720
   242	        by 350 pixels made the CGA's 640 by 200 look quite sad when
   243	        compared side by side, and suddenly people could have both
   244	        readable text and great looking graphics at the same time and
   245	        from a single system.
   246	
   247	        IBM's next move demonstrated that they'd been listening to their
   248	        user's complaints about the low resolution of the CGA standard.
   249	        They were also watching the guys at Hercules make money like
   250	        crazy and were attempting to serve the always mixed blessing
   251	        requirements of full backwards compatibility. The IBM Enhanced
   252	        Graphics Display was IBM's second generation solution, and
   253	        it rapidly became a new standard for the industry.
   254	
   255	        By recognizing the CGA system's crying need for better text, IBM
   256	        saw that it had to crank up the scan line count to something
   257	        more like their monochrome display; however, since full-color
   258	        long persistence phosphor monitors are barely affordable by
   259	        small countries, IBM knew that it couldn't play the trick of
   260	        getting the scan line count up by lowering the system's overall
   261	        refresh rate below 60 cycles per second. The only alternative was
   262	        to push the system's horizontal scanning frequency higher than
   263	        the monochrome system's.
   264	
   265	        This would mean that their new EGA display system would not be
   266	        backwards compatible to the existing installed base of 200 scan
   267	        line resolution CGA software. (The non-optimal solution crimes
   268	        which are continually committed in the name of backwards
   269	        compatibility is probably my single
   270	        biggest pet peeve. It directly accounts for the unprogrammablity
   271	        of the Intel microprocessor instruction set!) So, in order to
   272	        achieve CGA compatibility from their new EGA system, IBM
   273	        invented the "bi-synchronous" display system.
   274	
   275	        By inverting the polarity of the EGA monitor's Vertical
   276	        Synchronization signal, the EGA adapter is actually able to
   277	        switch the EGA monitor between two separate modes: The CGA's
   278	        horizontal sweep rate of 15,750 cycles per second and the newly
   279	        invented EGA horizontal rate of 21,800 cycles per second. The
   280	        15,750 hertz rate yields a CGA software compatible resolution of
   281	        200 lines, while the 21,800 hertz rate results in a full
   282	        Hercules-type resolution of 350 lines. In EGA graphics mode, this
   283	        results in a significant, Hercules-similar resolution of 640
   284	        by 350 pixels.
   285	
   286	        Since IBM seems determined not to kick the horizontal resolution
   287	        of these systems up above 640 pixels, we don't quite get the full
   288	        character separation beauty of MDA and Hercules text. On the
   289	        other hand, the EGA's character resolution budget
   290	        of 8 by 14 pixels is significantly better than the CGA budget of
   291	        8 by 8 and allows lower case characters with descending tails
   292	        like "g," "p," "q," and "y" to be imaged cleanly. The EGA's
   293	        resulting well-formed characters made most people happy.
   294	
   295	        The EGA's final addition to the CGA standard was the provision
   296	        for additional colors. Where the CGA display could display 8
   297	        colors in either of two intensities, bright or dim, the EGA
   298	        display, when operating in EGA mode, allowed each of its three
   299	        primary colors, Red, Green, and Blue, to be mixed together in
   300	        any of four intensities. Therefore 4 times 4 times 4, or 64
   301	        total colors could be displayed by IBM's EGA display. Though
   302	        technology has passed the EGA monitor by, it represented an
   303	        adequate, backward compatible, unification of the CGA, MDA, and
   304	        Hercules standards.
   305	
   306	
   307	                   IBM's recognition of the EGA's shortcomings
   308	                     with the creation of the VGA "standard"
   309	
   310	
   311	        On our journey toward the goal of selecting the best possible
   312	        display system for the least possible money for Steve's Dream
   313	        Machine, we've traced the evolution of IBM compatible display
   314	        system technology from the original CGA and MDA standards
   315	        through the development of the Hercules and EGA standards. IBM's
   316	        announcement of its new generation PS/2 machines offers yet
   317	        another display system to "the standard" throne. Oddly named
   318	        after the integrated circuit chip which implements it, the Video
   319	        Graphics Array, or VGA, has provided enough new cleverness and
   320	        innovation to displace the prior EGA standard.
   321	
   322	        With graphic user interfaces gaining ever more market
   323	        recognition and IBM's own OS/2 Presentation Manager on the
   324	        horizon, IBM needed to push their graphics resolution offering
   325	        above the EGA's 640 by 350. At the same time, IBM wished to
   326	        further enhance the system's color capabilities, probably to
   327	        further differentiate itself from Apple Computer's
   328	        monochrome Macintosh products and to better compete with Apple's
   329	        newer colorful Mac II. To further confuse things, this was all
   330	        happening at a time when IBM was determined to lower its
   331	        manufacturing costs.
   332	
   333	        While the EGA display was innovative with its split-personality
   334	        dual-frequency horizontal sweep rate in order to deliver both
   335	        350 line vertical resolution without sacrificing 200 line CGA
   336	        compatibility, is was more expensive to manufacture than IBM was
   337	        now happy with. IBM made a brilliant move in their VGA system
   338	        which completely eliminated the need
   339	        for the expensive frequency changing display while actually
   340	        enhancing the appearance of older CGA-style text and graphics.
   341	
   342	        The VGA's fixed horizontal sweep rate of 31,500 cycles per
   343	        second offers several wonderfully clever savings. In the first
   344	        place, dividing the horizontal rate of 31,500 hertz by the 60
   345	        cycle vertical rate yields 525 total horizontal lines scannable
   346	        during one screen. This high scan line count delivers even
   347	        better legibility from VGA text which now has a text character
   348	        pixel budget of 8 by 16, while the EGA's barely adequate high
   349	        resolution line count of 350 jumps up to a very respectable 480.
   350	        The excess line count (the difference between the 525 total and
   351	        the 480 used) even allows a tidy 1/4 inch border in all modes.
   352	
   353	        The VGA's cleverness stems from two additional things which IBM
   354	        did in order to deliver backward compatibility to the CGA and
   355	        VGA. The VGA monitor's very fast horizontal scan rate put IBM in
   356	        the enviable position of actually having, in some cases, too
   357	        many scan lines, rather than too few. So in such cases IBM
   358	        slightly INCREASES the vertical refresh rate (to above 60 hertz)
   359	        in order to trim back on the number of lines displayed when they
   360	        need fewer.
   361	
   362	        Secondly, rather than slowing the display's HORIZONTAL rate
   363	        drastically down to the CGA's 15,750 cycles, in order to deliver
   364	        just 200 horizontal scan lines, the VGA raises its VERTICAL rate
   365	        just slightly up to 70 hertz which yields 400 scan lines. Then a
   366	        clever double-scanning approach is used to emulate the CGA's 200
   367	        line mode. Double scanning simply repeats each of the CGA's
   368	        lines twice and results in a higher resolution appearance while
   369	        maintaining complete software backward compatibility.
   370	
   371	        The only remaining "tweak" required involves keeping the VGA's
   372	        displayed screen height constant which the IBM VGA monitor
   373	        achieves by sensing the polarity of the Vertical Synchronization
   374	        signal sent to it by the VGA adapter. The monitor uses the
   375	        Vertical Sync signal polarity to adjust the spacing between
   376	        successive scan lines so that the VGA's image is kept almost
   377	        uniformly sized throughout the increasing jungle of new, old,
   378	        and older display modes.
   379	
   380	        Thus the VGA system scans 350, 400, and 480 lines to achieve
   381	        CGA, EGA, and VGA compatible display modes while leaving the
   382	        horizontal scanning rate set to a constant 31,500 hertz and only
   383	        tweaking the vertical refresh rate between a happy 60 and 70
   384	        cycles per second. The result is a simpler and far less
   385	        expensive VGA monitor which exceeds the EGA's capabilities and
   386	        delivers far cleaner CGA emulation.
   387	
   388	        The other major change presented by the VGA system is an
   389	        expansion of the system's color capabilities. The original CGA
   390	        monitor utilized one signal each for Red, Blue, and Green
   391	        colors, and an additional single signal for intensity which
   392	        delivered 16 total possible colors. The EGA expanded upon this
   393	        by providing two signals each for the Red, Green, and Blue
   394	        colors, thus delivering four intensities of each color, with 64
   395	        color mixtures possible. The VGA's color system operates in an
   396	        ANALOG rather than DIGITAL fashion where varying voltages, rather
   397	        than ON/OFF signals are provided for each color for mixing.
   398	        Software and memory limitations pare the resulting infinite
   399	        color possibilities down to a maximum of 256 colors chosen from
   400	        a total palette of 262,144 in some display modes.
   401	
   402	
   403	                   NEC's Brilliant Creation of the Multisync,
   404	                       and 800 by 600 Resolution Graphics
   405	
   406	
   407	        We've taken a detailed look at the evolution of IBM compatible
   408	        display systems, focussing almost exclusively upon the multitude
   409	        of standards which have first been set then soon superseded by
   410	        IBM. We've seen that the various display adapters have always
   411	        been "tightly coupled" to their display monitors and have
   412	        frequently employed fancy "kludge" solutions (like conditional
   413	        inverting of synchronization signal polarities) when necessary
   414	        to maintain backward compatibility to the multitude of prior
   415	        standards.
   416	
   417	        Amid the wilderness created by the incredible array of vertical
   418	        and horizontal scan rates, a solid alternative to the eternal IBM
   419	        lock-step frenzy has arisen. Originally conceived by Nippon
   420	        Electric Corporation (NEC) as an answer to just this problem, the
   421	        so-called "multi-synchronous" display monitors are now selling in
   422	        the hundreds of thousands for a very good reason.
   423	
   424	        In what could only be called a truly astounding leap of insight,
   425	        the designers at NEC integrated the past and predicted the
   426	        future when they invented their original NEC Multisync, a single
   427	        unified display monitor solution for all adapter technologies
   428	        past, present, and future. Rather than following IBM with yet
   429	        another tightly coupled clone display monitor, NEC invented a
   430	        single monitor which quietly displayed anything it might be
   431	        handed by the system's display adapter. By accepting an unheard
   432	        of range of vertical and horizontal synchronization frequencies,
   433	        as well as both digital and analog RGB intensity signals, the
   434	        NEC Multisync became virtually obsolescence-proof.
   435	
   436	        While IBM was busily requiring all of its EGA owners to
   437	        completely scrap their "yesterday's solution," EGA monitors which
   438	        would no longer be compatible with the VGA of today (and
   439	        tomorrow?), and purchase the all new VGA displays, proud
   440	        Multisync owners only needed to change their monitor's cable
   441	        then flip a couple of switches at the rear of their displays.
   442	        That's what I call truly brilliant engineering!
   443	
   444	        Of course it wasn't long until everyone else recognized NEC's
   445	        brilliance and began cloning multisynchronous monitors like mad.
   446	        Today's mail order ads are drenched in "generic multisynch-ness"
   447	        because it's simply the right way to go.
   448	
   449	        However, there's something else which makes multisynching the
   450	        right solution, and after extensive experimentation and
   451	        comparison it has become an INFINITELY CRITICAL COMPONENT of
   452	        Steve's Dream Machine: Support of the wonderful 800 x 600 pixel
   453	        super high resolution modes which are now available from all
   454	        state-of-the-art EGA and VGA display adapters.
   455	
   456	        Many of you will remember that Steve's Dream Machine and I have
   457	        been holding onto monochrome display technology for dear life...
   458	        looking to monitors such as the Wyse-700/Amdek-1280 and MDS
   459	        Genius to provide the truly useful bit-mapped graphics
   460	        resolution which is, and will be, required by today's and
   461	        tomorrow's desktop publishing, MS Windows, and OS/2 Presentation
   462	        Manager applications. Until many months of searching yielded the
   463	        incredible, ultimate, adapter/monitor combination, I didn't
   464	        believe that a color system could really deliver "truly useful"
   465	        (and in fact wonderful) high resolution bit-mapped displays. It
   466	        can. I'll tell you about the results of my quest, but first we
   467	        need a bit more foundation...
   468	
   469	        It turns out that truly useful bit-mapped resolution requires
   470	        stepping above even the VGA's new 640 by 480 resolution up to
   471	        800 by 600. By cranking the horizontal sync up to 35,100 and
   472	        sneaking the vertical refresh just a tad below 60 hertz to about
   473	        56, any solid multisynchronous monitor can readily display 600
   474	        lines of 800 full color pixels per line.
   475	
   476	        There's something magical about the difference between 640 by
   477	        350, 640 by 480, and 800 by 600. It's a staggering difference.
   478	        The prior two resolutions simply pale by comparison to 800 by
   479	        600. Trying to understand why things get so incredibly better as
   480	        the resolutions are increased, I've decided that it's because
   481	        the total pixel count increases with the PRODUCT of the
   482	        horizontal and vertical resolutions. This is a powerful
   483	        relationship. For example, on a screen with square resolution,
   484	        the total pixel count would increase with the SQUARE of the
   485	        screen's edge resolution, so a DOUBLING of edge resolution
   486	        produces a QUADRUPLING of the total pixel count. Consequently
   487	        the standard EGA resolution of 640 by 350 contains only 46% of
   488	        the pixel count of 800 by 600, and even the VGA offers only 64%.
   489	        800 by 600 resolution delivers 156% of the VGA's pixel count.
   490	
   491	        So at this juncture we must leave IBM in the dust. Only enhanced
   492	        EGA and VGA adapters are able to generate 800 by 600 pixels, and
   493	        only multisynchronous displays can lock onto the extreme
   494	        synchronization frequencies required for the delivery of this
   495	        stunning and readily available resolution.
   496	
   497	
   498	                        The Incredible SONY CDP-1302A...
   499	                    Steve's Dream Machine Monitor of Choice!
   500	
   501	
   502	
   503	        Having decided that Steve's Dream Machine monitor had to be
   504	        multisynchronous in order to deliver the most resolution
   505	        possible, the next obvious question was: Which one was the best?
   506	        After staring endlessly at, and touching and feeling, just about
   507	        every available candidate, I determined that no other monitor
   508	        comes anywhere NEAR the quality of the Sony "Multiscan" CDP-
   509	        1302A. The Sony Multiscan is solidly entrenched as the Steve's
   510	        Dream Machine video display monitor. After purchasing several, I
   511	        couldn't be more pleased.
   512	
   513	        The single feature which distinguishes the CDP-1302A from the
   514	        crowd, placing it heads and shoulders above the rest, is its
   515	        image quality. Based upon Sony's legendary Trinitron color
   516	        picture tube, the 1302A packs its primary red, blue, and green
   517	        phosphors so closely together that white text actually looks
   518	        white, rather than appearing as an ugly island of white fringed
   519	        with red on one side, green on top, and blue on the other side.
   520	
   521	        Coming from the purely monochrome character coloring of
   522	        monochrome displays as I did, I just wasn't willing to sacrifice
   523	        text color purity for the sake of color. The Sony 1302A is the
   524	        ONLY monitor in the industry which doesn't compromise text
   525	        appearance for color capability. As I write this column with PC-
   526	        Write, I'm staring at white text on a blue background. With my
   527	        nose one inch from the screen, aside from being cross-eyed, I
   528	        absolutely cannot see anything but white text on a blue
   529	        background. No other monitor delivers this quality.
   530	
   531	        All contemporary color monitors operate through a process known
   532	        as "SPATIAL COLOR MIXING." Though from a distance the screen
   533	        appears smooth, homogeneous and continuous, it's actually
   534	        composed of thousands of individual red, green, and blue
   535	        phosphor regions. When the display's electron beams strike the
   536	        phosphors from behind they fluoresce and glow in one of the three
   537	        primary colors. By controlling the instantaneous voltages applied
   538	        to each of the three electron beams at the back of the CRT, the
   539	        red, green, and blue color phosphors in the region
   540	        where the beams are striking are made to glow in proportionate
   541	        brightness.
   542	
   543	        Our eyes, having somewhat limited resolution, don't see the
   544	        individual red, green, and blue phosphors in the region, but
   545	        instead spatially mix these colors into a single composite.
   546	
   547	        (It's rather incredible to realize then that the first thing our
   548	        eyes do is to re-separate this composite color back into its
   549	        red, green, and blue color levels since our eyes are built from
   550	        light sensitive rods and cones which selectively respond only to
   551	        red, green, and blue light!)
   552	
   553	        However, our eye's ability to convincingly spatially mix the
   554	        screen's primary colors is a function of the center-to-center
   555	        inter-color spacing, which is also known as the display's "DOT
   556	        PITCH." Not only does the Sony have a significantly tighter dot
   557	        pitch than any other large display in the industry (0.26
   558	        millimeters versus 0.31 or coarser for everyone else), but the
   559	        Sony's Trinitron'ness seems inherently better suited to the job
   560	        of helping our eyes to perform this mixing. It's almost as if
   561	        the individual colors are being pre-mixed behind the screen
   562	        before leaking out onto the tube's glass faceplate.
   563	
   564	        This dot pitch also means quite a lot when the monitor is being
   565	        called upon to display higher resolution images. As the number
   566	        of displayed pixels per inch begins to approach the number of
   567	        phosphor dots per inch a strange interaction known as "SPATIAL
   568	        FREQUENCY BEATING" occurs. You can most easily see this by
   569	        drawing single pixel wide horizontal, vertical, or slanted black
   570	        lines against a solid white background. Rather than appearing as
   571	        black, the line's width is so much smaller than the surrounding
   572	        illuminated pixels that these too-fat pixels bleed their colors
   573	        into the supposedly black line, rendering a non-black dimly
   574	        colored line. In practice, high resolution black on white
   575	        applications such as desktop publishing end up appearing
   576	        disturbingly multi-colored rather than pleasingly black on
   577	        white. The 800 by 600 pixel resolution which multisync displays
   578	        provide at no cost requires the dot pitch to be as tight as
   579	        possible.
   580	
   581	        If you care about your eyes, I urge you to check into the Sony
   582	        Multiscan CDP-1302A. This is NOT a place to compromise.
   583	
   584	
   585	
   586	                         And the Paradise VGA Plus Card,
   587	                       The Ultimate VALUE in VGA Adapters
   588	
   589	
   590	        Having answered the burning question of the ultimate video
   591	        monitor for Steve's Dream Machine with my enthusiastic ravings
   592	        about the marvelous Sony CDP-1302A multiscan monitor, the final
   593	        question to be answered for our display sub-system project is:
   594	        What's the ultimate display adapter?
   595	
   596	        Determining the correct answer to this question was complicated
   597	        substantially by the simple fact that the VGA marketplace is
   598	        filled with an incredible degree of clutter, misdirection,
   599	        overstatement, and outright lies. What you see and hear is
   600	        almost always FAR FAR different from what you actually get. Wild
   601	        claims made by VGA adapter manufacturers abound, the ads are
   602	        largely full of baloney, and it's quite hard to really know
   603	        what's true. It's also quite hard to know what really makes a
   604	        DIFFERENCE in VGA adapters, so consequently even the normally
   605	        shrewd buyer will wind up guessing.
   606	
   607	        As my research into VGA adapters progressed, and I learned more
   608	        and more, I became increasingly upset by the state of affairs and
   609	        committed a disproportionate amount of time and energy to
   610	        the task of finding out what's REALLY going on. Getting
   611	        underneath the covers to substantiate or debunk various claims
   612	        required the creation of special benchmarking software to
   613	        directly measure critical adapter parameters such as horizontal
   614	        sweep rates, overall vertical refresh rates, and raw low-level
   615	        adapter data bandwidths. What I discovered amazed me, and even
   616	        though the results of this research may upset some significant
   617	        players in the industry, I feel compelled to share what I found.
   618	
   619	        Since I don't want to tease you any more than necessary, I'm
   620	        telling you right up front, here and now, that for my money,
   621	        there is no adapter in the industry which delivers more overall
   622	        value than the inexpensive, analog-only, 8-bit, incredible
   623	        Paradise VGA Plus. Though the VGA Plus is currently in very
   624	        short supply, being affected both by its own popularity as well
   625	        as by our industry's current dynamic RAM shortage, it's an
   626	        incredible value at its current street price of between $230 and
   627	        $260.
   628	
   629	        I urge you not to purchase any other display adapter, VGA or
   630	        otherwise, until you've heard me out. Though you might have to
   631	        struggle and/or wait a while to find one, it'll be a decision
   632	        you couldn't regret.
   633	
   634	        The various VGA adapters in the industry may be differentiated
   635	        by applying the following tests and comparisons: raw low-level
   636	        data bandwidth, companion software drivers, display monitor
   637	        compatibility, IBM VGA register level compatibility, system-
   638	        level hardware compatibility, and to a lesser degree backward
   639	        compatibility with prior display standards.
   640	
   641	        Of all these characteristics, only video display compatibility
   642	        and backward compatibility are obvious from the surface. Every
   643	        other characteristic must be determined through actual use and
   644	        testing. The only negative feature of the Paradise VGA Plus in
   645	        this regard is it's total lack of support for the older digital-
   646	        only monitors including the original IBM monochrome, CGA, and
   647	        EGA displays. You won't be able to use the VGA Plus if you have
   648	        one of these, though Paradise has stated that they will make a
   649	        version of their card for sale to large OEM customers which will
   650	        support both digital and analog monitors. This liability is
   651	        shared by the Compaq and Video Seven Fastwrite and VRAM cards,
   652	        so the Paradise is in good company. Of course this is no problem
   653	        if you already own or intend to purchase any multisync monitor
   654	        like Steve's dream monitor, the Sony CDP-1302A.
   655	
   656	        Almost every VGA adapter in the industry is a so-called "five-
   657	        in-one" card. Five-in-one refers to MDA, CGA, Hercules, EGA, and
   658	        VGA, and means that such cards can run virtually any software
   659	        ever written to any of these major standards. The two notable
   660	        exceptions are IBM and Compaq which lack support for the
   661	        Hercules standard. Even though Compaq's VGA adapter utilizes the
   662	        Paradise PVGA1A VGA chip, and could thus have easily implemented
   663	        Hercules backwards compatibility and the useful extended
   664	        resolutions as do the Paradise VGAs, Compaq chose not to bring
   665	        these features to their purchasers, apparently preferring to
   666	        remain more strictly IBM compatible. For this reason, and
   667	        considering its high price, you'd have to really love the Compaq
   668	        name in order to intelligently purchase Compaq's VGA adapter.
   669	        It's a very nice adapter, but the Paradise Plus or Pro do more,
   670	        cost less, and are otherwise identical, all being based upon the
   671	        same VGA chip.
   672	
   673	
   674	
   675	                           Display System Performance
   676	
   677	
   678	        It's hardly surprising that the single hottest issue in the VGA
   679	        marketplace is performance. People want machines that don't
   680	        slow them down, and since our video display screens are the
   681	        windows into the souls of our machines, it's only natural to
   682	        want a screen that can keep up with the CPU which lurks behind.
   683	
   684	        Being a performance fanatic myself, the first thing I did was to
   685	        write a machine language benchmarking program to determine the
   686	        fundamental raw machine-level data throughput of VGA adapters.
   687	        As a low-end reference point, the true Blue IBM VGA adapter can
   688	        accept text data at 569 Kbytes per second and graphics data, when
   689	        in 640 by 480 resolution, at 592 Kbytes per second.
   690	
   691	        The IBM's raw text throughput of 569 Kbytes per second means
   692	        that the entire 4000 byte text screen could be re-written 142
   693	        times per second. Since display screens are only displayed 60 to
   694	        70 times per second, anything faster than this is completely
   695	        invisible and represents wasted performance. The point is, when
   696	        displaying a 25 line by 80 column text screen, even the SLOWEST
   697	        VGA card on the market (which the IBM VGA is) is twice faster
   698	        than is even visible! Those "8 times faster" performance claims
   699	        being made by several VGA competitors are based upon their
   700	        card's text-mode throughput and are about as useful as a jet
   701	        engine on a skateboard. I ignore such nonsense and the companies
   702	        behind it.
   703	
   704	        However, what's true for text mode performance is not
   705	        necessarily true for bit-mapped graphics. While an entire text
   706	        screen is specified by just 4000 bytes of data, a 16-color 800 by
   707	        600 high resolution bit-mapped image requires 240,000 bytes of
   708	        data! Even so, IBM's 592 Kbytes of graphics throughput can still
   709	        paint an entire VGA image in four-tenths of one second. That
   710	        really isn't bad.
   711	
   712	        So how do the other boards in the market compare? Well any board
   713	        based upon the Tseng Labs (pronounced sang) chipset will deliver
   714	        approximately IBM-grade performance. Tseng Labs based boards
   715	        such as those from Genoa, Orchid, Sigma, STB, and Tecmar have
   716	        throughputs of 591 Kbytes for text and 588 Kbytes for graphics,
   717	        which is actually a bit slower than IBM. The advantage these
   718	        boards have over the IBM is 5-in-1 backwards compatibility.
   719	        Unfortunately, this comes with an expense of yawning performance.
   720	        Several also utilize the Tseng Labs 1024 by 768 resolution mode.
   721	        This requires display screen interlacing which halves the overall
   722	        refresh rate and produces completely unacceptable display flicker
   723	        when using Ventura or with Window's color mixing scheme known as
   724	        dithering.  One positive feature of these cards is their full
   725	        support for the digital-only MDA, CGA, and EGA monitors, but
   726	        since such monitors aren't state-of-the-art anyway, it would be a
   727	        shame to choose a poor performing VGA adapter for the sake of
   728	        running a poor performing display. For these reasons, I don't
   729	        recommend Tseng Labs chip based VGA adapters.
   730	
   731	        Video Seven has been generating quite a lot of press attention
   732	        lately with their FastWrite and VRAM VGA adapters. Having
   733	        studied these boards at length with the hope that they would
   734	        turn out to be real screamers, I have to admit to being less
   735	        than fully impressed. I had significant hardware and software
   736	        incompatibility problems with the FastWrite and VRAM boards and
   737	        none with any others. Though I've heard that newer revisions
   738	        have solved many of the earlier problems, I still feel shy toward
   739	        them.  Also, the incompatible way their video BIOS was designed
   740	        prevents multitasking software from freely and properly
   741	        switching tasks between various extended modes. This alone would
   742	        keep me away from Video Seven's products.
   743	
   744	        However, it can't be denied that the Video Seven pair are
   745	        uncontested winners when raw throughput alone is considered. In
   746	        640 x 480 mode, the FastWrite came in with 1.812 megabytes per
   747	        second throughput, and the VRAM delivered a screaming 2.885
   748	        megabytes per second.
   749	
   750	        I was puzzled at this point because my favorite little Paradise
   751	        Plus board, with its 1.139 megabytes per second throughput, just
   752	        didn't SEEM to be any slower than the VRAM. It occurred to me
   753	        that the board's raw throughput was being "watered down" by
   754	        "software overhead" which would tend to equalize performance.
   755	        After writing a new set of benchmarks to test performance
   756	        THROUGH their respective Windows drivers, I found what I
   757	        expected. Despite the fact that the VRAM board could accept raw
   758	        bit-map data 153% faster than the Paradise Plus, the software
   759	        overhead in the Windows drivers resulted in a performance
   760	        difference of only 54%! When the application's own overhead was
   761	        factored into this, the VRAM edge was even further blunted.
   762	
   763	        Due to architectural characteristics of the Paradise PVGA1A VGA
   764	        chip, Paradise's 16-bit boards actually deliver NO MORE
   765	        PERFORMANCE than the inexpensive 8-bit Paradise Plus, Steve's
   766	        Dream Machine VGA board.
   767	
   768	
   769	
   770	                            The Display System Series
   771	                                   Loose Ends
   772	
   773	
   774	
   775	        Let's finish our study of the state of the art in IBM video
   776	        display technology by tying down a variety of loose ends. As
   777	        we've seen, my display adapter of choice is Paradise's 8-bit VGA
   778	        Plus. Surprisingly, the architecture of the PVGA1A chip, which
   779	        forms the heart of every VGA adapter from Paradise as well as
   780	        the VGA systems produced by AST Research and Compaq, gains
   781	        NOTHING from a 16-bit bus connector when the boards are used in
   782	        their high resolution bit-mapped modes. This means that except
   783	        for the additional memory on the Paradise VGA Pro board, there's
   784	        absolutely no benefit to purchasing it over the less expensive
   785	        8-bit Paradise Plus. In fact, the temptation would then be to
   786	        run the Pro card in its 256 color mode, but my benchmarks
   787	        revealed that display performance suffers with higher color
   788	        counts. This is hardly surprising since additional colors depend
   789	        upon the use of additional memory which must be managed by the
   790	        driving software.
   791	
   792	        After declaring the Sony "Multiscan" CDP-1302A to be today's
   793	        ultimate video display, I was contacted by many competing vendors
   794	        who wanted me to believe that their displays were better. As a
   795	        result of entertaining several such possibilities I'm more
   796	        certain now than ever that the Sony blows EVERYTHING else away.
   797	
   798	        As I acquire increasing experience with 800 by 600 resolution,
   799	        which you get "free" when the Sony is paired with the Paradise
   800	        VGA Plus, I'm becoming more and more certain that it's ultimately
   801	        the best general purpose resolution. When running at 800 by 600
   802	        resolution, the Sony produces an active image area which is 10
   803	        inches wide by 7.5 inches tall. Dividing each of these lengths
   804	        into the pixel resolution in that dimension yields exactly 80
   805	        pixels per inch IN EACH DIRECTION. This beats the Macintosh's 72
   806	        ppi resolution with a much larger screen while delivering the
   807	        Macintosh's popular "square" pixels which are exactly as wide as
   808	        they are tall. It's nice to have a system on which circles
   809	        appear circular and squares really are square!
   810	
   811	        While I'm thinking about high resolution under Microsoft
   812	        Windows, I really need to make sure you know about Micrografx's
   813	        incredible Designer product. Designer feels to me like a highly
   814	        evolved CAD package with an exquisite state-of-the-art Windows
   815	        user interface. Using Designer has become fast and reflexive. It
   816	        has that rare easy-to-learn feeling which results from several
   817	        generations of detail polishing. While Designer completely
   818	        answers my desire for the lightning fast creation of structured
   819	        graphics, I've been surprised and delighted to find that several
   820	        of my died-in-the-wool traditional "CAD freak" friends have
   821	        completely switched to Designer after seeing me mouse my way
   822	        around it. If you have any need for PC based drawing, I'd urge
   823	        you to take a peek at Micrografx's Designer.
   824	
   825	        I'm addicted to Ventura Publisher for the creation of all manner
   826	        of high grade hard copy, so the quality and legibility of
   827	        Ventura's displayed image has profound importance for me. If
   828	        you've been reading this column for long, you probably know that
   829	        I tend toward perfectionism, always needing to get the most out
   830	        of my system. So I've been irked by Ventura's three fixed
   831	        display screen zoom factors. At each zoom setting the image is
   832	        always either too small, leaving an unused "grey zone" to the
   833	        right of the page's image, or too large, requiring a horizontal
   834	        scroll to see everything.
   835	
   836	        Bitstream Inc. has developed and sells a fabulous technology
   837	        called FONTWARE which generates any size and resolution of
   838	        ultra-high-quality typefaces from a set of sophisticated
   839	        typeface outline masters. Since the EGA's pixels aren't square,
   840	        the EGA-compatible screen fonts which are shipped with Ventura
   841	        aren't specifically tailored for 800 by 600 resolution. So I
   842	        decided to used Bitstream's Fontware to regenerate an entirely
   843	        new set of Ventura screen fonts with SQUARE pixels, and while I
   844	        was at it, to choose a screen font resolution which would give
   845	        me EXACTLY the Ventura zoomed sizes I wanted.
   846	
   847	        After some experimentation, I'm delighted to tell you that I now
   848	        have exactly what I want from Ventura. By asking Bitstream's
   849	        Fontware technology to rebuild Ventura's screen fonts at 100 by
   850	        100 pixel resolution the text of a standard 8.5 by 11 inch page
   851	        with one inch margins EXACTLY FILLS the screen in Ventura's
   852	        "normal" viewing mode with Ventura's mode selection icons
   853	        displayed. The result is an incredibly clear and legible image
   854	        in 800 by 600 resolution which puts the VGA's defacto 640 by 480
   855	        image to shame.
   856	
   857	        Micrografx can be contacted about Designer at (800) 272-3729 and
   858	        Bitstream can tell you more about Fontware at (800) 522-3668.
