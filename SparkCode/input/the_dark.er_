    15	This is sort of an experiment.  It's going to star the cast of Ranma 1/2
    16	but I'm planning on a lot of cameo appearances.  One thing different about
    17	it is that it's going to be a bit more grim and serious than the usual, but
    18	with a more adventure type plot.  Yes this may be a first.  Yet it still
    19	will have it humorous points.
    20	
    21	Another thing is that I may seriously damage continunity here, but since
    22	this is a fan fiction, I don't care!  :-)  As for why I'm doing it, once
    23	you start writing fan fiction, you just can't stop!
    24	
    25	I'm also writing in story format instead of script format.
    26	I never did this before so things might appear a bit rough.
    27	But please bear with me and read it to the end.
    28	Hope you guys like it.

    32		A couple are seen walking together in the streets.  It's night time and
    33	the two have just left school, staying late together to do some extra work.
    34	They walk side by side with loving looks on their faces.  There is a light
    35	snow drift covering the city.  The young man looks at his girlfriend and is
    36	amazed how beautiful she looks in the snow and moonlight.  Typical of all young
    37	Japanese girls (well in all the tv shows he always watched) she was slender
    38	yet you couldn't call her skinny.  She wasn't exactly buxom but she
    39	definitely had the shapely form of a young girl about to enter womanhood.
    40	She had long flowing rich dark hair all the way down to her back.  The most
    41	attractive thing he found about her face, it was just set in the perfect
    42	mixture of a pretty yet still cute face.  Her smile was so dazzling and
    43	whenever he saw it his knees just buckled.  She even smelled wonderful,
    44	with or without perfume, it was as if she just had a natural fragrance that
    45	just released freshness.  But the thing he loved about her the most was her
    46	voice.  Every time she talked it was as if a little twinkle of a chorus was
    47	playing.  He could listen to her just talk for hours and days, it didn't
    48	matter what she was talking about, it could have been the most boring thing
    49	in the world.  It didn't matter, whenever she spoke he was just enraptured
    50	by her melodious voice.  It was a good thing she was a good student, if not
    51	he might have flunked out of school.
    52		 Don't get him wrong, he wasn't a pervert.  Or at least he didn't
    53	think of himself as one.  When he was with this girl he just felt as if he
    54	was in love, not in lust.  She was the type of girl that inspired love and
    55	relationship, not just some cheap physical one-shot attraction.  Someday
    56	she was going to be his wife.  "Oh", she said in a voice that silk would
    57	have envied, "tonight is just so beautiful!"  "Yes, it is", he agreed and
    58	drew his arm around her.  Her body trembled at his touch.  He allowed
    59	himself a smile.  And then she slapped him in the face. 
    60	
    61		"Honestly!", the girl said sharply.  "You just had to ruin a nice
    62		evening between two friends didn't you?!"  
    63	The boy picked himself up, the slap actually knocked him down.
    64	"But.. But..", he mumbled out.
    65		"You know every one said you were a playboy.  Oh sure you'd play it
    66		really cool as if you're so innocent.  But then you'd hit on
    67		every girl that would help you study.  Well forget it, I'm not
    68		falling for it.  You can walk yourself home."  With that she moved
    69		further up by herself.
    70		"This is what I get for being nice", she mumbled to herself.
    71	
    72	"But.. But..", was all he could get out.  Rats!, he thought.  He always
    73	blew it.  But he did really like her.  The other study-partners meant
    74	nothing to him!  If only he could make her see.  If only he could make her
    75	see that they were meant for each other.  It was written in the stars.  And
    76	she was going to be his wife after all, all he had to do was get enough
    77	nerve to ask her.  He was so exhilerated at that thought.  One day she
    78	would be his, Oh yes! she would be his.  One way or another.  Or so he
    79	hoped.  He was willing to do anything for it.  Boy, he hoped he wasn't
    80	as desperate as he sounded.
    81	
    82		Suddenly there was a scream.  It sounded like his young wife-to-be.
    83	but instead of her normally sweet musical voice, it was more like a badly
    84	off-key note.  He immediately leaped up and checked for the source of the
    85	distress.  Once he was sure he found it, he then contemplated whether he
    86	should leap to the rescue or run for reinforcements.  After all if it was
    87	something SHE was afraid of, then he couldn't be much help.  He may be in
    88	love, but he wasn't stupid, he told himself proudly. 
    89	
    90		"Is this your girl?", a voice from the darkness asked.  It was a
    91	whispery eerie voice which chilled him to the bone.  "Come and get her,
    92	she's still alive... and very warm", the voice continued to mock.  "Or, if
    93	you wish not to die a futile heroic death you may run for your life."  Then
    94	the voice broke off into a sinister laughter.  Adrenaline pumped through
    95	the boy.  He made up his mind to go for it no matter how stupid it was.
    96	He took a deep breath and turned and ran off with his tail between his legs.
    97	The bearer of the voice stared at him running off in the distance.  "What a
    98	fool", the voice commented.  "Together they may have had a chance, a slim
    99	one, but one nevertheless.  Did he really think I would let him get away to
   100	alert anyone else?"  First he would capture the fool, yes it would be a
   101	pleasurable game of cat and mouse, he thought.  And then he would enjoy his
   102	spoils.  The girl was only unconscious, he didn't have time to have her
   103	yet.  But after he dealt with her "boyfriend" he would take his painstaking
   104	time with her.  Oh Gosh!  He just loved being a bad guy!  But now the hunt
   105	begins.  He left out a loud long blood currtling nauseating sterotypical
   106	bad-guy laugh and began the chase.
   107	
   108	[ A symphony suddenly starts up while a chase BGM begins.
   109	  The words: "Presenting another Fan Fiction..." flash ]
   110	
   111	A white cloaked figure steps out of the shadows and starts chasing a boy.
   112	The boy is frightened silly and stumples as he tries to escape his attacker.
   113	
   114	[ The music reaches a crescendo and the words:
   115	
   116				RANMA 1/2 :

   118				THE DARKER HALF

   121	  slide onto the screen ]
   122	
   123	The white drabbed fellow easily catches up to the fleeing boy.  He grabs
   124	the boy's leg and throws him against a wall that conviently sprung up.
   125	Slowly he walks up to the trembling form of the boy.
   126	"Did you really think I'd give you a chance to run away?  How stupid do you
   127	 think I am?", he asked in his deep gluttoral voice.
   128		"Uh, is that a trick question?", the boy asked timidly.  In
   129	response his assailant lets out a snarl, when he opened his mouth we
   130	clearly see his long fangs.  The boy starts freaking.
   131		"Mommy!!!!"
   132	"I should warn you.  This is going to hurt a lot..."
   133	
   134	[ Scene freezes again and the words: "
   135		Original story by Karl Rim.
   136		Semi-original plot by Karl Rim.
   137		New character designs by Karl Rim."
   138	appear]
   139	
   140	The white cloaked fiend was preparing to take a bite out of the Big-shot
   141	boy.  "Please, you don't want me!  I taste aweful!  I treat my body really
   142	badly,
   143	 nothing but fat and cholesterol!  I haven't even bathed for two days!"
   144	But the cries of the victim are ignored and the demon/monster/alien,
   145	(technically they're all the same thing) prepared to feast.
   146	
   147	[ More words appear: "

   152		Mark of Smileyface approved :-)	
   153	" ]
   154	
   155	Suddenly a fan comes out of nowhere and whips into the white clad figure's
   156	neck.  He lets out a cry of pain.  This was the type of cry that was just
   157	loud enough let you know that he was hurt and mad but not too hurt to let
   158	you know he was worried about losing.  The would-be-victim sees his chance
   159	and runs off.
   160		"Looks like we found another stray one, Lover", exclaims a
   161		  young girl wearing a white kimono.
   162		"I'm tired tonight, let's quickly send him back into the darkness."
   163	A tall fellow in blue whips onto the scene.
   164	
   165	The twosome link hands and cast the spell binding the monster into his
   166	abyssmal prison.  The monster resists of course but to no avail.  It
   167	screams and hollers and rips off it's outer form.  What was thought to be a
   168	humanoid monster turned out to be some long scaly reptile-like monster.
   169	
   170	"You know Akane, you really shouldn't be watching this stuff"
   171	
   172			*	*	*	*
   173	"Ranma!", screamed Akane, a little more loudly than she meant to.  She was
   174	so enraptured with the TV she didn't notice Ranma coming up behind her.
   175		"Sorry, Akane I didn't mean to scare you.", replied Ranma.
   176	"I wasn't scared!"
   177		"Well you sure screamed loud enough.  Besides, you really shouldn't
   178		be into weird shows like that, Akane." 
   179	"Miyu is not weird!  It's a sad romantic story"
   180		"You mean a sappy story with a gimmick to scare young girls into
   181		 hugging their boyfriends"
   182	"I said I was not scared!"
   183		"Well you sure were trembling enough when I saw you.
   184		I mean, it's not even believable!  They have to have this thing
   185		called a Shima: both God and Demon, whatever that means.
   186		They just can't have an ordinary vampire afraid of sunlight,
   187		garlic and religious symbols.  Oh No, they just have to get fancy
   188		and make up some big storyline.  At least they could make it a
   189		little bit more interesting, with more fight scenes..."
   190	"Ranma... You're too noisy!  I'm trying to watch the show..."
   191		"Why, as if you can't guess the ending already.  A Shima goes
   192		around killing innocent people.  Miyu spends the first 20 minutes
   193		tracking it down as it kills even more people.  They fight for 4
   194		minutes.  In the end she links up with her Lover-boy and banishes
   195		it to the darkness.  Last 5 minutes some one makes some corny
   196		philosophical remark... OOF!"
   197	Out of patience Akane has just thrown a cushion in Ranma's face.
   198	"I said Shut-up!  I'm trying to listen."
   199	
   200	"Remember", a voice from the TV says, "some times you must face your
   201	 darker half that you fear the most to overcome a greater evil."
   202	
   203		"What did I tell you!", yelled out Ranma.
   204	Akane then picked up the couch and slammed it down on Ranma's head.
   205	"What did *I* tell *you!*", responded Akane.
   206	
   207			*	*	*	*	*
   208	
   209		In a familiar street scene a blue cloaked man is investigating
   210	some blood stains on the new snow.  He bends down and seems to sniff at the
   211	blood.  
   212		"Hmm.  Fresh too.  They're getting bolder.
   213		 Do they really think they can hide from me with such carelessness?
   214		 They will pay for their arrogance.  Innocent lives will be Avenged!
   215		 Vengeance shall be served!"
   216	
   217	The man raised his fist high in the air as he makes his pledge.
   218	At that time the night-time shoppers have started coming out.
   219	"Who is that?...."
   220	"I don't know...."
   221	"Is he some kind of wild-man?..."
   222	"No, I don't think he's the village idiot...."
   223	"Maybe we should call the authorities...."
   224	"Murmur....Murmur...."

   227	
   228		Gosunkugi was happy.  This might not seem unusual for some one to
   229	be happy but this was one boy who was usually in utter despair.  So what
   230	could bring him out of his misery and make him happy?  Only the love of
   231	the girl he desired the most.  Akane Tendo.  To him she was the most nicest
   232	and prettiest girl he had ever met.  Whenever she would smile at him his
   233	heart just melted.  He knew she could love him if he was just given a chance.
   234	If only that Ranma guy wasn't in the way she might actually be able to return
   235	his love.  Since he was relatively a week guy, and Ranma was very strong,
   236	most people may have given up all hope.  But one thing he learned was that
   237	there are always strong people in the world.  The trick was to let them
   238	beat each other up leaving him free to grab the prize, Akane!  One day she
   239	would be his, Oh Yes!  She would be his.
   240		To accomplish this goal he usually he resorted to inane magical
   241	rites which never worked.  But since that was all he really had, he had no
   242	other alternative.  Occassionally Kunou would actually do his work for him
   243	but that was rare.  Kunou could only get beat up every so often despite
   244	what he liked to think.  But today was different.  He got a real genuine
   245	summonings kit for only 10,000 yen.  How did he know it was real?  Well
   246	today he got lost on the way home and ran into a store selling magical
   247	items that he never saw before.  Since he never encountered it on his way
   248	before it must have appeared by magic!  He's seen all the movies and manga.
   249	A magical store would appear to aid those with a true heart.  Then a
   250	magical entity would appear and give him anything he desired.  Hmm, maybe
   251	this magical helper would even be female and really cute, and then maybe...
   252	No No No!  His only desire was Akane Tendo.  Gosunkugi knew all he had to
   253	do was summon a strong spirit to defeat Saotome Ranma and then Akane would
   254	be all his!  As he drew the protective pentagram (one could never be too
   255	careful) on the floor and prepared himself for a summonings.  Then just
   256	before he began he wrote his last will and testament.  One could never be
   257	too sure.
   258		Poor Gosunkugi, little did he know that he would be setting in
   259	motions things beyond his control.  He was doomed to failure.  If only he
   260	saw the large "Grand Opening" sign on top of the store.  He would do
   261	anything to win Akane.  Anything.
   262	
   263	
   264			*	*	*	*	*
   265	
   266		In a far away and unknown place (well maybe not that far away since
   267	we don't know the exact location, heck it could be your neighbor! Ahem Ahem
   268	well back to the story) a dark and sinister meeting was being held. A group of
   269	figures, all wearing dark robes to match the dark room and the dark rite,
   270	were seated in a circle.   They were in the middle of their own summonings
   271	ritual.  Preparations took days and they have been chanting for hours.
   272	They were also dark in spirits.
   273	
   274	"How much longer do we have to do this?", one asked.
   275		"Until it works", another whispered back.
   276	"And why is this place so dark anyway?", a third silently complained.
   277		"Because our illustrious leader forgot to pay the electric bill."
   278	"I'm hungry!", yet a forth quietly exclaimed.
   279		"Will you guys keep it down, and get back to chanting!", their
   280		leader nearly screamed.
   281		"If we mess this up, we're going to have to start all over..."
   282		"...Again!"
   283	"This is stupid!", one figure yelled out.  He got up and tossed his hood
   284	and cloak on to the floor. 
   285	"This cloak is too hot and this lousy communication ceremony isn't working!"
   286		"Look you want to take this up with the boss?
   287		 The last person who complained became the new wall decoration"
   288	"The whole point IS trying to take it up with the boss.  But we can't
   289	 because we're too busy trying to make contact.  I mean if the boss is so
   290	powerful then why isn't communication just a snap  of a couple of fingers..."
   291	
   292	"HELLO ALL", a loud voice boomed into the room.  The voice seemed to be
   293	coming from every where.
   294		"It's the boss!", the men screamed.
   295	"YES IT'S ME."
   296		"Uh, welcome boss, it's been a while", one of the men nervously
   297		exclaimed.  
   298	"BE QUIET.  I DIDN'T COME TO EXCHANGE PLEASANTRIES.
   299	 DON'T SPEAK UNTIL YOU'VE BEEN SPOKEN TO"
   300		"Right boss..."
   301	"I THOUGHT I SAID...."
   302		"Uh, sorry boss!  I mean...!", he spat out.  He was going to get it
   303		now, he was only burying himself deeper with every apology.
   304	"SIGH!  NEVER MIND.  NOW TO BUSINESS.  WE NEED TO SECURE ANOTHER
   305	 BASE OF OPERATIONS.  MY EMPIRE IS EXPANDING AND WE NEED TO MAKE OUR PLANS
   306	 BIGGER!  I WANT A NEW NEXUS AREA OF POWER IMMEDIATELY.  MAKE SURE IT HAS
   307	 A SUPPLY OF STRONG WARRIORS FOR RECRUITING"
   308		"We'll get right on it, boss"
   309	"GOOD.  ANYTHING ELSE?"
   310		"Well, do you mind toning it down a little boss?
   311		 I mean we can all hear you fine, but the neighbors might
   312		 start getting curious."
   313	"WHAT?!  OH SURE, GIVE ME A SEC.  JUST GOT TO FIND THE VOLUME SWITCH.
   314	 There, how's that?"
   315		"Perfect, boss."
   316	"Of course!  Now if there is no further business..."
   317		"None boss"
   318	"Good.  Then who was the one that was complaining about my limited powers?" 
   319		"HIM!", all the other men pointed their fingeres at a sole solitary
   320		figure.
   321	
   322		"Gee, thanks a lot guys", he said sardonically.
   323	"Well for your information, I can so set up communication like that <snap!>"
   324		"Well, then, why didn't you do that before?!", he demanded.
   325		"Instead of making us wait for hours!  We are your trusted
   326		followers!  We have followed you through thick and thin!
   327		I would think we would expect a little graditude."
   328	
   329		Luckily for him he had still had a friend to defend him.
   330		"What he meant was: Oh, dear merciful Leader, did you find it
   331		necessary to test your most unworthy followers?
   332		If so we truly understand", his friend blubbered.
   333	
   334	"I just wanted to see how devoted you guys were.", came the response.
   335	"AND if if any one had any guts",
   336		"Huh?", her followers droned.
   337	"I like those who have spirit and a little spunk.
   338		"Then you're not angry?", the singled out man asked.
   339	"Well... may be just a little.  No one likes a discontented army but
   340	 sometimes it's better to have someone with some brains then a bunch of
   341	 mindless wimps.
   342	 Look, here's another trick I can do with just snapping my fingers <snap!>"  
   343	
   344	With that little sound, a loud snap of light crackled into existance.  The
   345	light popped down and sped straight down like a lightening bolt.  In fact
   346	it was a lightening bolt!  It circled around the astonished men and impaled
   347	itself in one of the men's arms.  Three guesses which guy.  In a single
   348	instance it struck his left arm and transformed it into a charred lump.
   349	His cries of anguish echoed out into the chamber.
   350	
   351	"However", the leader's voice flared into pure venom.  "There is a fine
   352	line seperating zeal and open defiance.  Guess who crossed it?  
   353	I will not tolerate such behavior in the future.  Understood?!"
   354		"Yes, boss", the man replied weakly, clutching his injured arm.
   355		"Didn't hurt a bit", he rattled through clenched teeth.
   356	"You know, I kind of like you.  Guess what, I'm going to promote you.
   357	 I was looking for to head this new expedition.
   358	 I think you've got what it takes to lead these ya-hoos."
   359		"You are too kind", he managed to let out.
   360	"Good, now start phase II"
   361		"Uh, boss...?", the present leader of the group timidly asked.
   362	"Oh right.  Someone call the healer for him"
   363		"He IS the healer", he replied sadly.
   364	
   365			*	*	*	*	*
   366	
   367		From a far land there is a lone solitary figure, wearing an old cloak,
   368	sitting and meditating.  Suddenly his head snaps up.  He seems to be in
   369	pain but then slowly relaxes.  
   370		"Yet another one.  A great evil is rising.
   371		Justice will not wait.	I am called... again."
   372	
   373	The figure picks himself up  and dusts off a large stone block with some
   374	rune carvings on it.  He then puts some straps around it and carries it on
   375	his back.  He gathers up a few belongings as well.  His journey begins.
   376	
   377			*	*	*	*
   378	
   379		Gosunkugi had been chanting for hours.  It didn't seem to be
   380	working.  Well the thing was he couldn't read the manuscript since the
   381	writing was so faded.  Despite the fact it was also in english, he made it
   382	up a summonings chant as best as he could from the parts that he could
   383	read.  But no matter what happens he was safe in his pentagram.
   384		Suddenly a flare jumped out in front of Gosunkugi!  The flare grew
   385	bigger and bigger until it become the size of a door.  And like a door two
   386	figures stepped out.
   387	
   388		"Ohhh, I *hate* teleporting, makes me sick", said one figure
   389	wearing a green coat.
   390	"Oh quick complaining.  We're here aren't we?  Better than flying or
   391	running any day", said the other man who was wearing a purple suit with a
   392	purple coat.
   393	"Are you summoned spirits?", asked Gosunkugi, not quite believing he
   394	managed to summon not one, but two beings.  Too bad they weren't very cute.
   395		"Hmm, is this the place?", asked the one in green.
   396		"Yeah, apparently there's supposed to be a good potential for
   397		power and troops here.  Hey look a kid!", said the one in purple.
   398	"I am Gosunkugi.  I am your master.  I have summoned you here", Gosunkugi
   399	said, mustering as much bluster as he could.
   400		"Is this kid for real?", Green asked dryly.
   401		"Quiet, let me handle it.  And he can't be stupid.  He's got a
   402		protective pentagram."
   403	"I repeat, I am your master, Gosunkugi.  If you wish to return to your
   404	 home dimension, you must bargin with me!".  Well that was assuming  he
   405	could even send them back.  He wasn't sure how he even got them here.
   406	Maybe by reading the encantations backward?
   407		"Oh great, master!  (Quiet GC!)", purple said in a deceptive voice.
   408		"You truly have us at a disadvantage.  Might we ask of what
   409		 area of Japan you have imprisoned us in?"
   410	"I have called you to the city of Furinkan!"
   411		"Furinkan?  Then this is the right place.  Glad to know that
   412		the teleporter hasn't lost it yet", mumbled Green.
   413		"Will you please shut-up!", whispered Purple.
   414	"Wait, how did you know we're in Japan?"
   415		"You blew it", Green complained.
   416		"Shaddap!  Uh, well you see, master...
   417		 We're uh, really popular spirits.  We're summoned all over by
   418		 Japanese wizards...", Purple explained hesitently.
   419		"Um, uh, yeah, that's the ticket, yeah!", mocked Green.
   420	"Good!  I have need of strong and experienced spirits", Gosunkugi said.
   421	He was very pleased that he managed to nab such flexible fellows.
   422		"Maybe he's not as smart as I thought", Purple considered thoughtfully.
   423	"Now for your task:  I want you to defeat the man known as Saotome Ranma!",
   424	 demanded Gosunkugi.  You know, it was really easy to get into the absolute
   425	master role when you got gave it a little time.
   426		"Is he a strong warrior?"
   427	"Alas yes"
   428		"Pay dirt!", Purple whispered-yelled.
   429		"Now all we have to do is lose this kid.", Green whispered back.
   430		"No, if we kill him we may be losing a valuable source of
   431		information.  We still know nothing about this place and it's
   432		defense levels.", explained Purple
   433		"We can handle anything", Green yawned.
   434		"Then why don't you step outside to see what time it is?"
   435		"Alright you got me there.  Well in any case he's still protected
   436		 by that lousy pentagram.  Only our most powerful attacks will
   437		 penetrate." 
   438		"And they'll also kill him.  No let me handle this.", Purple whispered.
   439		"Dear Boy.  We have no intention of doing that.", Purple smiled his
   440		evil grin, the one that would really unnerve the inexperienced
   441		novice types, like Gosunkugi.  Yep, it seemed to be working.
   442		Gosunkugi was already sweating like a pig.
   443	"What?!", exclaimed Gosunkugi worriedly.  Was he really sure he got the
   444		defenses right?
   445	"But you can't!  I'm your master!"
   446		"Master?!  Snort!  You couldn't even stop us from tearing you limb
   447		from limb", said Green as he advanced on Gosunkugi.
   448	"W...Wait!  You can't approach me past the pentagram!"
   449		"Pentagram!?  You sure are a novice aren't you?	 Any real
   450		 experienced spiritualist would tell you that it's a Pentagon!"
   451	"Really?"
   452		"C'mon, the essence of magic is in it's simplicity and power.
   453		 Look at the US, do you know why they're so strong militarily?"
   454	"Their nuclear war-heads?"
   455		"No... well mabye...  Anyway the real reason they're so strong
   456		 is that their military headquarters is the Pentagon!"
   457	"You're right!  That makes sense.  Wait!  Wait", Gosunkugi desperately bent
   458	down and started erasing his badly drawn pentagram and quickly started
   459	drawing a pentagon over it.
   460	"Uh, how many sides?"
   461		"Five"
   462	"Thanks!"
   463		"They have to be completely even or the spell doesn't work"
   464	"Thanks again!"
   465		"No problem"
   466		"You are *good*", beamed Green admiringly.
   467		"Yeah, aren't I?", gloated Purple.
   468		"C'mon lets get him."
   469	Green roughly grabbed Gosunkugi by the neck.
   470	"Urk!  Wait!  I'm not finished yet!"
   471		"Oh yes you are", purred Green.
   472		"Don't kill him.  We need him as an agent", Purple warned.
   473		"Trust me, I have my own tricks up my sleeve."
   474	
   475	Green gave a wink and locked his eyes on Gosunkugi's.  Gosunkugi took one
   476	look at his eyes and suddenly all sense of resistance faded away.  He saw
   477	in his eyes a primal force that screamed: Give up! over and over again.
   478	When he even considered about disobeying they started yelling: Die!  Die!
   479	Gosunkugi tried to resist but he was no match for his powers.  Green raised
   480	his right hand on top of the left side of Gosunkugi's face.
   481		"Be at peace.  Be at rest.  Do not fight me, else I will harm you.
   482		 Our minds shall become as one.  What you know I shall know.
   483		What I know only I shall know.
   484		We are together as one: Master and slave.
   485	"Our minds are one, Master", drummed Gosunkugi vacantly.
   486		"I think you've been watching too much star trek", Purple said sourly.
   487		"Live long, Prosper and stick it"
   488	
   489			*	*	*	*	*
   490	In another area, the absolute leader of the invaing force, was in
   491	conference with his elite officers. 
   492	The current official was presenting the newest conditions of the advance.
   493	
   494	"All goes in readiness, your grace.", the official declared.  His voice was
   495	a monochrome buzz, as if the voice was hundreds of years old, lacking
   496	almost any emotion whatsoever.
   497		"Excellent.  Are all the forces in place?", the leader asked.
   498	"Yes they are.  Lately all our agents have infiltrated major cities in the
   499	 country.  With the new power base centered in this town known as
   500	 Furinkan, our power nexus will be complete.  Japan will be yours"
   501		"Very Good.  And then we can move across the world...
   502		 Just how did you find this new base-city?"
   503	"We traced a weak mystic signal.  Amazingly it was just what we were
   504	 looking for.   Agents Purple Coat and Green Coat are already there and
   505	 have started building operations and subjugating the local populace."
   506		"What about man-power?"
   507	"This town seems to be ripe in supernatural power.  It seems to be a
   508	 natural magnet attracting many spectres and beings.  In addition there is a
   509	 fine cadre of experienced troops to be recruited. 
   510	
   511	In the center of the room a large rectangular light suddenly blinks in.
   512	It then cools down into the form of a smooth mirror.  In it several forms
   513	appear.  First Ranma, then Ryouga, Mousse, Kunou, and a couple of others
   514	including Genma, Soun, Dr. Tofu and Mikado.
   515	
   516		"Hmmm.  Very nice.", the leader murmurred.
   517		"What else?"
   518	
   519	"Well there also seems to be a very nice selection of possible *extensions* ".
   520	
   521	Again the rectangular mirror shimmered.  This time images of Akane, Ukyou,
   522	Kodachi and Shampoo and a few more girls such as Azusa appear.
   523	
   524		"VERY Nice..."
   525		"What about the local constables?", the leader asked.
   526	"Yes.  That is the beauty of it.  There seems to be none."
   527		"What?!  Explain."
   528	"Well, we're still not too sure about it yet.  But there hasn't been a 
   529	 single sighting of law enforcement in years.  Suprisingly crime hasn't
   530	 run rampant except for some occurances of panty raids.  We think it might
   531	 be due to the high number of perverts in the city.  We're still
   532	 investigating it."
   533		"Hmm.. I don't like it.  Take extra precautions.  My plans are
   534		too important to be upset by any random factors.
   535		Anything else?"
   536	"Actually yes.  There seems to be a slight problem.  Actually two special
   537	 cases." 
   538	
   539		The magic mirror shimmered yet again and two small figures now
   540	dominated the plane.
   541		"Them!", gasped the leader.
   542	"Yes, your grace.  But don't worry too much.  Despite possible
   543	 confrontations, we have already deployed special task force plans to
   544	 neautralize the targets.  They will not interfere. 
   545	 The power is ours.  No one can stop us, no one"
   546		"No, there is still one who could ruin our plans"
   547	"The renegade?  Surely we can handle him, he is only one and.."
   548		"No not him.  We are now too strong for him to stop us.
   549		 Besides last time I checked he was fighting the local
   550		 constables in another town.  He was always an idealistic fool.
   551		 Actually I was thinking about the wandering one"
   552	"That wandering one?  We don't fit his specific parameters.
   553	 He's the stuff of ledgends, he hasn't been sited for....
   554		"I know, I know, but he is real.  We even clashed a very long time ago.
   555		I was still a young world-conqueror.  I doubt he even remembers me.
   556		I was just small potatos to him, he never took me seriously.
   557		But our plans are becoming much too big for even him to ignore.
   558		He will seek us out, and when he does, we best be prepared"  
   559	"Very good, your grace."
   560	
   561			*	*	*	*
   562	
   563	In the distace, a lone figure is seen trudging mile after mile.  Nothing
   564	will stop him.  He would reach his destination without fail.  It is his
   565	destiny and duty.  He will fight his dark foe again.  It is written in the
   566	stars. 
   567	
   568			*	*	*	*
   569	
   570		In another town nowhere near Furinkan, in a college class,
   571	two students notice their bracelets lighting up.
   572	"Kay-kun!  Did you get the signal?", a young but very attractive girl asked
   573	a somewhat slow witted but comely young man.
   574		"Yes I did, Aih", the one known as Kay responded.
   575	"Then you know what this means.  We've been called to duty and ..."
   576		"..and we get to cut school!", exclaimed Kay.
   577	"Fool!  It means that we have a possible assignment.  And that means it's
   578	dangerous.", Aih chastised.
   579		"Oh yeah, that's right.  They wouldn't call us if it wasn't."
   580	"They only call us if it's something that the regular forces couldn't handle.
   581	 Something para-normal"
   582		"Sounds like trouble"
   583	"It's always trouble.  C'mon, we better head for debriefing"
   584		"Sigh!  And midterms begin in two weeks.  When are we going to
   585		prepare?" 
   586	"Don't worry about.  Maybe you won't come back from this one", Aih joked.
   587			*	*	*	*	*
   588	
   589		A figure is crawling through a desert.  He slows down several times
   590	but he never completely stops.  No, he is too determined.  Onward he will
   591	go.  He will never give up on his quest.  Hours later he is still seen
   592	continuining.  Finally he stops and bends down to catch his breath.  He
   593	looks up to the skys as if challenging them.  In a loud bellow he screams:
   594	"Does anyone know the way to the Tendo Dojo?!!"

   598	1 - Did you hate/like it?  Should I continue or work on something else?

   617	This story was not meant to be written in typical Ranma 1/2 story.
   618	I am just using the characters in a different style as a sort of experiment.
   619	So don't expect the usual slapstick (but of course some will still exist)
   620	
   621	However responses haven't been very good (or even existing).
   622	My experience has been that if it's not really good, people won't trouble
   623	themselves to read it or even comment on it.
   624	So as an attempt to boost up ratings, and for easier reading(you) and
   625	writing(me), I'm going back to writing in scripish format.  Some parts were
   626	still written in story format since I wrote them before coming to my new
   627	decision. 
   628	
   629	This next part also has something that I completely forgot about:

   636	[ At Furinkan High School it is the start of a new school day.  Various
   637	  students are seen coming in.  However no matter how busy they may be, the
   638	  students seem to always have time to exchange the daily gossip ]
   639	
   640	"Yeah, did you hear?  Another student was reported missing."
   641	"Apparently she was coming home late from studying and never arrived home"
   642	"Well that'll teach them to study so much at school"
   643	"Well I heard she was having a secret tryst with her boyfriend"
   644	"Maybe she ran away with him"
   645	"Well she is just the 10th missing student so far"
   646	
   647	[ Enter Gosunkugi.  He looks the same except something seems different
   648	about him.  His stature, his walk, his entire attitude seems changed.
   649	He walks tall and straight yet something about his eyes.  His eyes have a
   650	more tired and spaced out look, more so than usual.  They're always just
   651	staring out into space ]
   652	
   653	"What's wrong with Gosunkugi, he's been acting weird"
   654	"What do you mean weird?"
   655	"I never see him do those mystic ceremonies anymore"
   656	"That's weird?"
   657	"Well, it's weird for him"
   658	"Hurry up, the Vice-Principle is calling a special session in the
   659	 auditorium about the disappearing students" 
   660	
   661	[ In the auditorium ]
   662	Vice Principle:
   663		Students of Furinkan Koukou.  I am going to address a serious
   664		problem that has been plaguing this school.  I'm sure you have all
   665		heard about the missing students.  The Principle is out of the
   666		country on a educational exchange program in Hawaii.
   667		However the matter still hasn't escaped his attention, he has left
   668		a letter on the subject and instructed me to address it to you.
   669	
   670		[reading the letter]
   671		My dear students...
   672		The real world, as you are finding out, can be a very dangerous place.
   673		I regret I cannot be there to protect you all.
   674		In a sense I am your father and you are all my children.
   675		But since I am not there in body, I have left some careful
   676		instructions for you to follow to help protect yourselves.
   677	
   678		(1) If any of you are faking and playing hooky, as a result
   679		    you will wash the toilets for 3 months!
   680		(2) Always walk home in groups.  There is strength in numbers.
   681		(3) Walk in well lighted areas near a lot of people
   682		(4) Don't talk to strangers
   683		(5) Follow a curfew.
   684		(6) Hold hands when you cross the street and look both ways before
   685			crossing.
   686		(7) Always have your parents check your Halloween candy beore eating it
   687		(8) And get a traditonal Furikan Japanese hair style.  Be marked as
   688		a proud patriot of your country.  No one will dare cross a student
   689		of Furinkan High.....
   690	
   691	[ The students have already started filing out ]
   692	Vice:	Hey?!  Where is everyone going?
   693		Oh well, it was a stupid speech.
   694	
   695	[ Outside near a tree, a group of boys are meeting ]
   696	Boy1:	Alright, Gosunkugi, what's up?
   697	Gosunkugi: You guys want to see something interesting?
   698	Boy2:	Like what, Gosunkugi?
   699	Gosunkugi: Come to my house tonight and find out.
   700	Boy3:	Well I'm not sure, I've got a lot of things to do
   701	Gosunkugi: I have some *special* pictues of Akane to show you.
   702	Boy3:	Well, since you put it that way...
   703	Gosunkugi: Don't tell anyone you're coming.
   704	All:	No problem!
   705	
   706	[ After the school day Akane and Ranma are walking home together ]
   707	Ranma:	That's unusual.
   708	Akane:	What Ranma?
   709	Ranma:	Kunou hasn't showed up to fight for the past 2 days.
   710	Akane:	Maybe he's given up?
   711	Ranma:	You don't really believe that, do you?
   712	Akane:	No, you're right.
   713		Maybe Kunou is one of the missing students...
   714	Ranma:	I don't think so.  I'm never that lucky.
   715	Akane:	I can't help but feel something strange is going on.
   716		It's not just students, people all over Furinkan have
   717		been reporting people disappearing.
   718	Ranma:	Great now all we need is a dead body and we can break into
   719		a mystery plot.
   720	Akane:	Be serious!
   721	Ranma:	I wouldn't worry so much, I've seen much wor..WHOOPS!
   722	Akane:	Ranma!  Are you okay?
   723	Ranma:	Yeah, I just tripped over that hand lying over there..
   724	Akane:	....HAND!!!

   730		In some secret government bunker a debriefing is taking place.  Two
   731	figures walk in a conference room.  One is a young man and the other is a
   732	young woman.  Both are dressed in some sort of military uniform.
   733	
   734		"Officers Aih and Kay reporting for duty", the woman stated.
   735	
   736	They immediately snapped to attention.
   737	
   738	"At ease Em-chan, you know I don't like being formal", said a
   739	distinguished young man from a chair.  Like the others he looked young but
   740	seemed a little older by maybe 5 years.  From his markings he was a superior
   741	officer.
   742		"Please don't call me that, sir", officer Aih replied.
   743	"I'm your superior officer.  I can call you whatever I want.
   744	 Isn't that right Sugar-plum?", their superior asked officer Kay.
   745		"Uhh, where is officer Whii?", asked officer Kay trying to get off
   746		the subject.
   747	"Oh, he asked for time off to study for his College Entrance Exams.
   748	 We're not totally heartless you know, Kay-kun"
   749		Kay just groaned and thought how low his GPA was going to be this
   750	semseter.
   751		"Can we just get to business, sir?", snapped Aih.
   752	"Ah yes, ever the woman of action", remarked their superior officer.
   753	"I'll let Dr. Kno handle the debriefing.  Long boring explanations are his
   754	forte.".
   755		Another figure stood up.  He was an old man wearing spectacles and
   756	a labcoat, looking very sterotypically scientist-like. 
   757	"Thank you Officer Zen.  I'll get straight to the point.
   758	 This is the current situation..."

   760	The doctor pressed some buttons on a controller he was holding and a nearby
   761	monitor started lighting up various charts and data.
   762	
   763	"The city you see before you is the town of Furinkan.  It looks like any other
   764	ordinary city.  Recently however there has been some quite unusual activities.
   765	The local police force found it impossible to handle it so the government
   766	pulled them out and put us in.  For the most part we have been observing
   767	via satellite and secret remote-controlled cameras.
   768	The town seems to have been dominated by extermely powerful paranormals.
   769	While exceedingly rare, such beings are not unheard of."
   770	
   771	The monitor begins to flash various scenes of popular fights in Furinkan.
   772	Ranma vs. Ryouga (various streets and buildings are being wrecked)
   773	Ranma vs. Golden Pair ( an ice rink is totally devestated )
   774	Ranma vs. Mouse (minor property damage)
   775	Ranma vs. Shampoo's Great Grandmother (incidents at the beach)
   776	Ranma vs. Happosai (too numurous to log)
   777	Ranma vs. Panda (fights on a fence overlooking a river)
   778	Ranma-chan vs. Kodachi (school property severly thrashed)
   779	Ranma-chan vs. Shampoo (building structures are being destroyed)
   780	etc.
   781	
   782	Officers Aih and Kay look visibly shocked.
   783	"These people seem to be even stronger than Whii-kun!", Aih said amazed.
   784		"Oh please, Em-chan, I think you're still a match for some of these",
   785		Officer Zen remarked.  
   786	"I wish Whii was here to back us up", gulped Kay.
   787		"Kay-kun, you never got along with Whii very well as I remember",
   788		Officer Zen reminded him.
   789	"Yeah, but if I'm going to get beat up, I want it to be from someone still
   790	 human!", exclaimed Kay.
   791	
   792	Dr. Kno continues: "There are also appearances of what we believe to be
   793	mystical beings/monsters/ghosts and maybe even aliens..."
   794	
   795	Again the monitor flashes showing us some more of our favorite fight scenes:
   796		Ranma vs. Dojo Yaburi
   797		Ranma vs. a winged Minotaur
   798		Ranma vs. Demon Ghost-cat
   799		Ranma vs. GIANT Happosai
   800		Ranma interacting with various minor ghosts.
   801	
   802	"Ghosts....", whispered Aih.
   803	"You're making this up, right?", asked Kay nervously.
   804		"I thought you of all people wouldn't be suprised Kay-kun", scolded
   805		Officer Zen.
   806	
   807	"And even evidence of esper or magical power", Dr. Kno flashed more images.
   808	
   809	Ranma using his Heavenly Rising Dragon Whirlwind Fist attack.
   810	Ryouga attacks with his exploding point technique.
   811	Ryouga unleashing his Ki as a force bolt.
   812	Shampoo's Great Grandmother is preforming various special attacks.
   813	Happosai unleashing the power of his firecrackers in a wild display of
   814	fireworks. 
   815	
   816		"So where do we exactly fit in?", asked Aih.
   817	"You and Kay-kun will be disguised as transfer students at the local
   818	high school.  Both of you still look young enough to pass.", explained Zen.
   819		"That's because we are", Kay said.
   820	"Your goal will to closely observe the occurances in the town.
   821	 We want specific reports on what's going on in the city", Zen said.
   822		"Why this personal interest all of a sudden?", enquired Aih.
   823	"Well, you see, crime wasn't a major problem even without the local police
   824	force.  Even the Yakuza didn't overrun the city.  We believe that there was
   825	a martial arts dojo of the Tendo clan to handle any such incidents."
   826		"So why the sudden interest?", persisted Aih.
   827	"Ah, Aih-chan, there's no putting anything past you.  I never knew a more
   828	alert and capable officer..", 
   829		"So *why* the sudden interest?", Aih interrupted.
   830	"Okay Okay.  Something recently occured in the city that has us in an
   831	 uproar.  I'm hesitant to mention it to you since it might be a little
   832	 shocking to you."
   833		"Well the department must feel it's not a big enough shock to
   834	  	 prevent us from duty, since we were still called in for
   835		 debriefing.  I would rather know now than finding it out later by
   836		 myself ", Aih said. 
   837	"You're right.  The thing is, about 50 people have all dissapeared.
   838	 And more are missing every day."  
   839		"That's not that unusual.  What is this, some mass kidnapping ploy?",
   840		 Kay commented.
   841	"Well six of them were found this morning..."
   842		"That's great!", Kay said.
   843	"...dead."
   844	The room fell dead silent after Zen's last remark.

   847	[ At the Tendo Dojo, some town elders are asking for help in solving
   848	  this unusual delimna. ]
   849	
   850	Soun:	Please accept our sympathies.
   851		It is truly a shame about those six people....
   852	
   853	Man:	Since this terrible misfortune, the people of our fair city
   854		are all in turnmoil.  For any semblance of normancy to return,
   855		this dark mystery must be solved and any missing survivors found.
   856		We humbly ask you to investigate this matter further.
   857		The security of the city rests on your shoulders Tendo-san.
   858		[ Bowing ]
   859		There is none other we can turn to.
   860	
   861	Soun:	Please, there is no need.  This too troubles me.
   862		There hasn't been a death in this town since.... since....
   863	
   864	Nabiki:	This has been the first time since we lived here father.
   865	
   866	Soun:	Since as long as I can remember!  And there shall be no more!
   867		This heinous deed shall not go unpunished!!
   868		The culprit will not escape the pursuit of justice!
   869		
   870	Ranma:	You can count me in on this too.  I haven't lived here as long as
   871		you all may have, but Furinkan has become my home and I don't want
   872		any filthy murderers running around it. 
   873		Right, dad?
   874	
   875	Genma:	Murderers?....
   876	
   877	Kasumi:	Oh dear, has any one seen Happosai?
   878	
   879	Soun:	Well, honorable guests it was nice of you to stop by.
   880		[ he pushes them out the door ]
   881	
   882	Genma:	What are we going to do?!  We can't fight our sensei, Happosai!
   883	
   884	Ranma:	Wait!  Hold on!  Before jumping to conclusions let's think this
   885		through carefully.	 
   886	
   887	[ Everyone takes a deep meditative form ]
   888	
   889	Soun:	Simply being an underwear thief, a freeloader, and a merciless
   890		sensei hasn't been enough for him,
   891		Happosai has finally resorted to murder!
   892	
   893	Genma:	Then we're next!
   894	
   895	[ Genma and Soun start packing everything up to move away ]
   896	
   897	Ranma:	Will you two cut it out!  Think about it.
   898		Happosai may be scum even a pig wouldn't touch,
   899		but he would never resort to something like this.
   900	
   901	Kasumi:	But, he's been gone for so long.
   902	
   903	Ranma:	Exactly, I'm willing to bet, that Happosai is one of those people
   904		that disappeared.  Why didn't we report him earlier as missing?
   905	
   906	Genma:	Well, we didn't really notice that he was gone....
   907	
   908	Soun:	And we didn't actually MISS him...
   909	
   910			*	*	*	*	*
   911	
   912		In a dark room a single shape stands out.  A square window of light
   913	is floating on the floor.  From it sounds and images are eminating.
   914	The command: "Execute general order 52!", came from the window.	
   915	
   916	"Will you shut that thing off and hurry up?!  The meeting is about to
   917	 begin!", Purple Coat screamed out as he turned on the lights.
   918		"What?!  Kirk just ordered the Enterprise to execute a...", Green
   919		Coat started protesting.
   920	"I don't care if he's about to execute the Klingon throneworld!
   921	 The meeting is about to begin and you haven't even set anyting up."
   922		Grumbling Grean Coat shut off the TV.
   923		"You know you're getting awefully cranky, I think the power is
   924		getting to your head.", Green replied.
   925	
   926	"Enough!  You are a Fang warrior, act like one", the invasion commander
   927	stated as he walked in.
   928	"I will not tolerate any more delays"
   929	
   930		Hmf!  It was as if a guy couldn't even get a decent amount of
   931	television to enjoy, thought Green Coat.  He and Purple Coat were doing
   932	fine until the old Battle-axe Invasion Commander came along to head the
   933	operation.  He heard he got the command after a grueling interview in which
   934	he had his left arm struck by lightening.  Something like that kind of makes
   935	you lose your sense of humor.  But Green Coat still thought that was a poor
   936	excuse.
   937	
   938	"How many of the townspeople have you subjugated?", asked the commander.
   939		"About 50", responded Purple.
   940		"More like 60.", corrected Green.
   941		"We worked pretty fast.", he bragged.
   942	"You fool!", the commander yelled out and hitting Green's head with his fist.
   943	"If you keep up this pace we're bound to attract attention!
   944	 If our cover is found out before our power base is complete all our plans
   945	 may be ruined!"
   946		"Oh, who's going to notice?", Green asked.
   947	"And how are you keeping track of all your victims?"
   948		"Uh, well..."
   949	"Well, I'll tell you how you are.  You're not!  And because of your
   950	non-existant accounting, you cretins already lost six people!"
   951		"I thought HE was keeping track of them", Green and Purple each
   952		responded simultaneously, pointing to each other.
   953	"I don't care whose fault it is.  The townspeople have already found the
   954	  bodies.   I want you to slow down the operations and be watchful of
   955	 any who might be gettting too suspicious."
   956		"Yes sir!", Purple promised.
   957		"Yeah, yeah, Yow!", Green yelled out when the commander hit him again.
   958	
   959	There was just no satisfying this guy, thought Green Coat, rubbing his head.
   960	Why was he always blaming me?  And how do these guys always manage to
   961	summon up a wooden mallet out of thin air anyway?
   962			*	*	*	*	*
   963	
   964	Akane:	Ranma, where are you going at this time of the night?
   965	Ranma:	Our dads and I are going to find those missing people.
   966	Akane:	And how do you propose to do that?
   967	Ranma:	Look, this is a man's job, leave the details to us.
   968	
   969	[ they leave]
   970	Kasumi:	Please return safely.
   971	
   972	Akane:	Those idiots.  Well I guess it's up to me to do my own
   973		investigating.
   974	
   975	Kasumi:	Don't stay out too long Akane, dinner will be ready in an hour!
   976	
   977	[ At Dr. Tofu's clinic ]
   978	Akane:	Tofu sensei, you examined the bodies, what do you make of it?
   979	Tofu:	...
   980	
   981	[ Dr. Tofu has a very intense look on his face ]
   982	
   983	Akane:	Tofu-sensei, what's wrong?
   984	
   985	Tofu:	Akane-chan.  Listen to me very carefully.
   986		Things are changing in Furinkan.  Very bad things are happening.
   987		I want you to go home, pack your things and leave Furikan with your
   988		sisters for a while.
   989	Akane:	Tofu-sensei....
   990	Tofu:	Please Akane-chan, go!  There's no time to lose!
   991	
   992	[ Dr. Tofu pushes her out the door and closes it behind her. 
   993	  Akane is so bewildered she just stands outside for a while ]
   994	
   995	Akane:	What....
   996	
   997	[ She then hears some sounds fron the door.  She tries listening but can't
   998	seem to make out anything.  Apparently Dr. Tofu is working on something ]
   999	
  1000	[ In another scene Ranma and the others are seeking out the help of
  1001	Shampoo's Great Grandmother ]
  1002	
  1003	Genma:	Ranma, is this wise?
  1004	Ranma:	Relax, with something this big I figure that old woman
  1005		should know something about it.
  1006	Genma:	What if she's the one behind it?!
  1007	
  1008	[ We see Shampoo sweeping in front of her restaurant. ]
  1009	
  1010	Ranma:	Shampoo!
  1011	
  1012	[ Shampoo just ignores her.  She just continues sweeping ]
  1013	
  1014	Ranma:	Shampoo, it's me Ranma.  Ranma!
  1015	Shampoo: Oh hello, Ranma.
  1016	
  1017	[ Ranma notices something wrong.  Shampoo isn't running up and hugging him
  1018	like she usually does. ]
  1019	
  1020	Ranma:	Shampoo, what's wrong?
  1021	Shampoo: It's Great Grandmother.  [ continues sweeping ]
  1022	Ranma:	Uh, what about her? [ nervously starts looking around for any ambushes]
  1023	
  1024	Shampoo: She's gone. [ continues sweeping ]
  1025	Ranma:	What do you mean? [ still looking around ]
  1026	Shampoo: Great Grandmother received a message from our village to return
  1027		immediately.  Something bad happened.  But she wouldn't tell the
  1028		family what it was.  I'm afraid for her.
  1029	Ranma:	...
  1030	
  1031	[ Genma and Soun who were hiding breath a sigh of relief ]
  1032	
  1033	Shampoo: I..I have to get back to work Ranma.
  1034	
  1035	[ Shampoo goes into her restaurant. ]
  1036	
  1037	Ranma:	What could have Shampoo so worried about her Great Grandmother?
  1038		I've never seen her so worried.
  1039		Something is definitely very fishy around here.

  1048		Hi there!  My name is Ryo Seaba.  You proabably know me better as
  1049	the City Hunter, super-detective and all around hunk.  Many of you have
  1050	proabably complained about why Tokyo subways are always so darn crowded.
  1051	Well take it from me.  As long as I've been an investigative detective
  1052	there's no better way to get around in Tokyo.  The subway is cheap, fast,
  1053	and mostly reliable.  But if you think it's bad in here you haven't tried
  1054	hailing a taxi or riding one stuck in a gridlock.  And subways don't have
  1055	meters running.  Besides there are a lot of fringe benifits from riding on
  1056	a crowded subway.
  1057	
  1058	[ Ryo smiles as he flattens himself against a young girl ]
  1059	
  1060	Oh!  Excuse me miss.  You know you have a very soft....
  1061

  1063	
  1064	I'm so sorry, but you see I just can't seem to move out of the way.
  1065	Oh no, it looks like we're stopping between stops again, oh well....
  1066	"Ryo!!!  I see you there!"
  1067

  1069	  running Kaori with a wooden mallet to reach up to Ryo. <SLAM!>]
  1070	
  1071	Uh, Kaori, how did you catch up to me?
  1072	Kaori smiles, "I took the subway"

  1078	subject. [ smiles] No don't worry, it's not a sex talk.
  1079	
  1080	[ We hear cries of BOO!  coming from the background ]
  1081	
  1082	No, this isn't about AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases.
  1083	No this is something worse.  I want to talk to you about drugs.
  1084	They're bad news.  Don't let anyone push you into taking drugs.  If anyone
  1085	is telling you that drugs are cool they're lying and they're not your
  1086	friends.  As a matter of fact taking drugs is uncool.  Don't listen to
  1087	their lies.  There's nothing exciting about taking drugs.  Drugs won't make
  1088	you popular or special.  The only thing drugs will bring you is Trouble.  
  1089	Take it from me.  I don't do drugs.  And none of my friends do either.

  1102		Arts school to investigate the matter and search for the missing
  1103		victims. 
  1104	
  1105	Commander: I see.
  1106	
  1107	Purple:	I wouldn't worry too much sir.
  1108		Our spy tells us that for the most part, they're a bunch of idiots.
  1109		They pretty much act like the local police force.
  1110		It's amazing some other group hasn't infiltrated this place already.
  1111	
  1112	Commander: I wouldn't put too much stock in what your spy, Gosunkugi says,
  1113		   considering he's an unwilling pawn.  And considering he's  also
  1114		   an idiot. 
  1115

  1130	
  1131	Commander: I see.... In any case, have this "police force" elimated descretely.
  1132		We don't need any more publicity.  I don't want any more
  1133		investigators investigating the investorgator's deaths.
  1134	
  1135	Green:	Could you say that one more time?

  1139	
  1140	Green:	Right away, SIR. [ exits ]
  1141	
  1142	Commander: Is agent Green Coat always so insubordinate?

  1144	Purple:	He may act a bit rough, but he's one of the top agents.
  1145	
  1146	Commander: I see. Any word from Central?
  1147	
  1148	Purple:	Yes.  The Boss is still worried about the Wandering one.
  1149	
  1150	Commander: Ah yes.  The entity our Leader seems to fear so much.
  1151		In any case there is only a low probability that he will even
  1152		seek us out.  I'm more interested in any activities of the
  1153		renegade.

  1159	[ We here Green Coat in the distance: "Yeah, with both 'eyes'!" ]
  1160		<grumble grumble>
  1161		Still, he's very clever and dangerous, he might actually track us
  1162		here.  It might be best for the Teleporter to send us some more
  1163		experienced reinforcements. 
  1164	
  1165	Purple: If we are in need of strong warriors, this investigative 
  1166		police force may be what we are looking for. 
  1167	
  1168	Command: I se.. uh, I mean: By all means, if they survive: recruit them.

  1176		"Look I'm telling you I'm innocent!"  He was getting really annoyed.
  1177	Here he was investigating a possible murder and tracking down this
  1178	malicious organization and the next thing you know he's been arrested for
  1179	the murder of two high school students.   "You're making a big mistake!"
  1180	But his explanations were falling on deaf ears.  Okay maybe he was a little
  1181	overzealous when he knocked out one of the police officers when they tried
  1182	to handcuff him.  Now he had to deal with about ten officers surrounding him.
  1183		"Sure you are", one of the leading officers said.
  1184		"Why don't you come down by the station and explain your side of
  1185		things"
  1186	"I already told you, precious time is wasting!  The real murderers are
  1187	getting away.  It may already be too late!"
  1188		"You sure seem to know an awful lot about this case..."
  1189	"I didn't do it!  I'm the good guy chasing the bad guys who did it.
  1190	 This is pointless and I really don't have time for this"
  1191		"If it already may be too late.  Then you won't mind spending a
  1192		little more time in a cell explaining yourself."
  1193	He stood up to his full height and gave a swipe from his blue cloak in a
  1194	martial arts stance.  He has had it!  No Mr. Nice Good-Guy.
  1195	"Foolish Man!  You are dealing with forces beyond your understanding.
  1196	 I am attempting to aid your people and all I receive is scorn and
  1197	distrust.  Enough of this.  I will take my leave of you.."
  1198		"Oh, I don't think so..."
  1199	"And how do you propose to stop me, little man?"
  1200		"With these.."
  1201	While they were talking police reinforcements have arrived.  He couldn't
  1202	believe they actually managed to stall him until morning.  Had they really
  1203	talked that long?!  The Swat team came rolling in with their laser scopes
  1204	and automatic weapons clicking and snapping and making all those darn
  1205	neat-o sounds when a person was targetting his weapon.  Hmmm, a team this
  1206	size with this much firepower under these conditions might actually be an
  1207	...annoyance.
  1208	"Okay, I give up.", he mumbled.  They may have me, but they can't hold me...
  1209	for too long anyway.

  1212	
  1213	Genma:	Where do you suggest we start looking now?
  1214	Ranma:	I figured we would just walk around town and hopefully run into them."
  1215	Genma:	And maybe if we walk around the corner we'll also run into
  1216		a beautiful fairy who'll grant us all a wish.
  1217	Ranma:	You got a better idea?!
  1218	Genma:	Yes, let's go home.
  1219	Ranma:	Huh?
  1220	Genma:	Well, look at it this way.  The missing people could be anywhere.
  1221		The chances of us finding them are about the same as us looking
  1222		anywhere else.  Maybe we'll find them on the way home.
  1223	Ranma:	Yeah and maybe they'll just come looking for us and save us the
  1224		trouble...
  1225	Soun:	Ranma-kun, look!
  1226	
  1227		From around the corners an army of people started coming out.  One
  1228	by one they trickled into the streets.  First they appeared in front of
  1229	them and then behind.  In seconds they were surrounded.  The trio would
  1230	ordinarily have been happy to find all the missing people all like this.
  1231	If only they all didn't have those crazy looks on their faces.  If only
  1232	they still looked alive.  The crowd started moving in with shuffling steps.
  1233	They were as pale as ghosts, dead in spirit and deadly in intent.  
  1234	
  1235	Ranma:	I think we found the missing people.
  1236	Genma:	Couldn't we just unfind them now?
  1237	
  1238			*	*	*	*	*
  1239		"Hey chief."  The police chief looked up from his desk.  The night
  1240	shift was just starting but he was still stuck here doing all this blasted
  1241	paperwork.  When he accepted his promotion he never expected such a drastic
  1242	change from walking the streets to filing the reports.  The rookie was just
  1243	about to leave his shift before coming up to him.
  1244	"What is it?", the chief asked the rookie.
  1245		"That guy in cell 4..."
  1246	"The one we picked up for the missing school kids?"
  1247		"Yeah, that's the one, he gives me the creeps."
  1248	"Well crazy killers all seem creepy."
  1249		Remember when they dragged him in here this morning?"
  1250		All he kept on saying the whole time was something about
  1251		'we were only dooming ourselves.'
  1252		And then when he was put into a cell, he just sat there indian
  1253		style and didn't even twitch."
  1254	"Yeah, I remember.  He would have done a statue proud."
  1255		"He's just been sitting there for the last 10 hours straight.
  1256		He hasn't asked for food, water or even go to the bathroom."
  1257	"Wasn't the only time he moved  was when we tried to fingerprint him or
  1258	search him?" 
  1259		"Well, when we tried to do that, he just gave this really scary
  1260		look at us.  Nobody had enough nerve to go into the cell with him
  1261		even with a battalion of armed guards right outside"
  1262	"Well, we ran him through a metal detector on the way into his cell.  It's
  1263	the new standard equiptment.  The only thing that registered was that
  1264	 circular metal disc with two slits which he claimed was his mask."
  1265		"Aren't you afraid he might try to break out?"
  1266	"Not really.  That metal disc isn't going to help him pick or smash any locks.
  1267	 We probably couldn't even pry it away from him if we wanted to.
  1268	 Besides we have enough guards on duty to plug him full with holes if he
  1269	 tries anything.  He's locked in an electronic windowless cell down in
  1270	 maximum security.  He's has no tools and no weapons.  He's not getting out."
  1271		"Yeah I guess so chief, but he still gives me the creeps.
  1272		You know, the only time he said anything was when I just left.
  1273		He asked me if I was going to be replaced by the night shift."
  1274	"What did you answer?"
  1275		"I told him I was, I don't see how that's really going to help him.
  1276	"He probably wanted to know how long he was down in there.
  1277	 There's no way he can even tell if it's even day or night."
  1278		"Well so far he hasn't been very cooperative.  Refuses to answer
  1279		even the simplest questions."
  1280	"Don't worry, he's not going anywhere without a proper explanation.
  1281	 I'm willing to let him rot in there until he starts talking.
  1282	 Even if he can bend bars, alarms will alert us if there is any tampering
  1283	 with the cell.  There's no where for him to go.  He's imprisoned in a
  1284	 secure, escape-proof maximum security cell", the chief said adamantly. 
  1285	
  1286	We see flashes of the state-of-the-art detention facilities.  The security
  1287	monitors, the integrity alarm centers, the electromagnetic locks and the
  1288	cool uniform bars all stand unchallenged.  And in the maximum security ward
  1289	we also see rows and rows of prison cells.  And of course they're all empty. 
  1290

  1292	
  1293		Ranma was fighting these ghouls for what seemed like hours.  None of
  1294	them seemed to recognize him.  He saw schoolmates, neighbors, people who
  1295	yelled at him in the streets for destroying their homes, and even total
  1296	strangers.  All of them just had this blank look on their face.  The cut he
  1297	received from a one of these zombie's claws (don't these guys ever cut
  1298	their fingernails?) on his back was starting to hurt.  He certainly knew
  1299	that all his moving around was only aggravating the wound.  Every time he
  1300	knocked one down three more would just rise up to take it's place.  He lost
  1301	track of the others in the resulting melee.  And the goons wouldn't stay
  1302	down, they just picked themselves up and kept coming and coming and...

  1391	Thank you all who sent me comments.  I'm sorry if I seemed like whining.
  1392	The reason I was asking for feedback was that I was afraid this new Ranma
  1393	style was really bad so I wanted to get a reaction to see if this thing was
  1394	worth continuing or not.  Heck, if no one liked it, why bother working so
  1395	hard on it?  But since there appears to some interest (both good and bad :)
  1396	I will do my best to continue the story.
  1397	
  1398	There has been mixed preferences over the writing style.  I decided to
  1399	write in prose when there is a lot of activity and write in script whenever
  1400	there is a lot of dialogue with more than two parties.  To understand
  1401	dialogue in prose, every different person or set of parties will have a
  1402	different indentation.
  1403		"Party 1"
  1404	"Party 2"
  1405	
  1406	Also, I mistakenly called the city Furinkan, after the high school.  The
  1407	reason was I didn't know what the city name was so I used the HS name
  1408	hoping no one would really notice.  But someone recently informed me that
  1409	the place is Tokyo, the Nerima ward on the outskirts.

  1416		How does he always get himself into these fights?, Ranma wondered.
  1417	All he was doing was investigating the murder of six townspeople and 50
  1418	missing people with his father and Akane's father.  Then while walking down
  1419	the street they bump into them.  But they were changed, they become like
  1420	zombies.  And true to their nature they started attacking, trying to
  1421	flail off his flesh.  Ranma fought the best he could, but the people just
  1422	started clawing and biting.  He just hoped whatever they had wasn't
  1423	contagious.  Suddenly there was a flash of green and Ranma felt a blow to
  1424	the back of his head.
  1425		When Ranma finally threw off the effects of his ringing head, he
  1426	noticed that his assailants were pulling him down.  Ranma struggled with
  1427	all his might but he just couldn't budge them.  There were too many of
  1428	them.  Slowly but surely he was dragged down down into the ground.  With a
  1429	last burst of strength Ranma managed to pull up.  With a gasp of air he
  1430	surfaced.  To his suprise he was in a freshly dug grave.  
  1431	"How did I get here?", Ranma wondered.  And then he noticed the
  1432	tombstone, on it was written the name: Saotome Ranma.  "No!", Ranma
  1433	screamed.  "NOOOOOOO!", he screamed a little louder as if volume alone
  1434	could change the course of destiny.  But soon the zombie hands were back,
  1435	grabbing him and pulling him down again. 
  1436	
  1437	Ranma:	Get back!  Get away....... NO!
  1438		Leave me alone!
  1439	
  1440	Tofu:	Ranma, stop struggling.  Wake up, you're safe, you're safe...
  1441	
  1442	Ranma:	Huh, huh, oh, it was a dream, just a dream...
  1443		That's the last time I watch Vampire Hunter D and eat all that junk
  1444		food before going to sleep.  Oh, my body aches all over...
  1445		Tofu sensei, what are you doing here?!  
  1446	
  1447	Tofu:	Taking care of you.
  1448	
  1449	Ranma:	[ looks down at his body and notices he has a lot of bandages ]
  1450		It wasn't a dream... it wasn't a dream....
  1451	
  1452	Tofu:	Ranma, get a grip on yourself!
  1453		You were in a fight, but you're safe here in my clinic now.
  1454	
  1455	Ranma:	Yeah, Yeah I remember now.  HAHAHAhahahaha.....
  1456		That was one spooky fight [ shudders ]
  1457	
  1458	Tofu:	You were hurt pretty badly Ranma.
  1459	
  1460	Ranma:	Wait!  Where's everyone else?  Where's Mr. Tendo?
  1461	
  1462	Tofu:	Mr. Tendo is in even worse condition than you.  He's still asleep.
  1463	
  1464	Ranma:	What about my dad?
  1465	
  1466	Tofu:	....
  1467	
  1468	Ranma:	Where's my dad?  What happened to him?
  1469	
  1470	Tofu:	He's not with us.  He stayed behind at the battle.
  1471	
  1472	Ranma:	WHAT?!?!  Why would he do such a thing?
  1473		Can he do such a thing?
  1474	
  1475	Tofu:	Your father bravely defended our escape.
  1476	
  1477	<Flashback>
  1478	
  1479	Tofu:	Please Mr. Saotome, Ranma and Mr. Tendo need immediate medical
  1480		attenton!
  1481	
  1482	Genma:	Wait Wait!  Come back!  Come back!  Don't leave me!
  1483	
  1484	<End Flashback>
  1485	
  1486	Ranma:	Wow, I never knew he could make such a noble sacrifice.
  1487	
  1488	Tofu:	I'm afraid he hasn't returned yet.
  1489		You were very lucky I was passing by.
  1490	
  1491	Ranma:	Well, I better get going, it's up to me to save the town again...
  1492	
  1493	Tofu:	Ranma, please rest, you took a very nasty beating.
  1494	
  1495	Ranma:	No problem Tofu-sensei, I'm trusting your unparralled medical skills..
  1496	
  1497	Tofu:	Ranma, I may be able to fix broken and dislocations but I can't do
  1498		a thing to speed up cut wounds, if you start moving you're going to
  1499		reopen your wounds...  
  1500	
  1501	Ranma:	ARRAHHARH!!!
  1502

  1511		Clickity-clickity-clack, The Hack went down the Stack.  What a
  1512	bunch of amateurs.  A blue robed figure was hacking away at a keyboard.
  1513	First they lock me in a cage termed "maximum security" for a crime I didn't
  1514	commit.  Then they don't even moniter their own halls.  And finally they
  1515	leave their terminal room unguarded with direct access into their database.
  1516	But it was still a  challenge in the software sense.  The police, like any
  1517	other administrative system had their own unique operating system with a
  1518	help mode that might as well have been in a foreign language.  He had to
  1519	quickly master it before he was discovered.  Fat chance of that, not only
  1520	was the police force totally incompetent, but he was a master of stealth,
  1521	not a single sound would resonate from his graceful movements.  But
  1522	cracking the database and actually making up the right queries to get the
  1523	information he needed wasn't an easy task.  But he enjoyed having something
  1524	to test himself to avoid his boredom.  He knew it was a smart move to get
  1525	his Computer Science Degree at night classes at Tokyo University.
  1526	
  1527		"AHA!  I thought I heard someone in here!", came a voice.  It was
  1528		from a young redheaded police woman.
  1529	What?!, he thought.  How did she hear me?  I'm as silent as the night breeze.
  1530		"I knew something was wrong when I heard the clicky-clack of a 
  1531		 keyboard but didn't hear anything else as well.  Only a criminal
  1532		cyberpunk would go to some such trouble to hide themselves.",
  1533		she explained out loud.
  1534	Oh well, you can't win them all, he consolded himself.  He swiftly rose up
  1535	with his back to her and stumbled into a chair he didn't see, making a loud
  1536	clatter.  Ouch!, he thought.
  1537		"I wouldn't move if I were you!", she warned and pointed her gun.
  1538	In response he slowly turned around confidently.  What a shame he couldn't
  1539	see the gun behind him.  He started speaking in a voice like ice.  As he
  1540	spoke he slowly raised his head in a cheap theatrical ploy.
  1541	+ "I am the terror that hacks in the night
  1542	   I am the magnet which erases your hard drive
  1543	   I..."
  1544		" ...talk too much.", she finished for him and then emptied her
  1545		revlover.
  1546		"But I don't think that'll be a problem anymore.", she said.
  1547	
  1548			*	*	*	*	*
  1549		In the next day, a familar couple is seen walking towards Furinkan
  1550	High.  The pair turn out to be the Government Special Agents Kay and Aih.
  1551	
  1552		"It sure feels weird to be wearing school uniforms again", Kay said.
  1553	"It's only been two years Kay-kun", responded Aih.
  1554		"Well, truthfully, I didn't really enjoy high school.  And I'm not
  1555		very thrilled at the idea of retaking it."
  1556	"I remember."  Aih suddenly started giggling.
  1557	"I remember that it was partly my fault too.", she confessed.
  1558		"No, it wasn't.  I was dumb enough to put myself in all those
  1559		stupid situations." 
  1560	"But still, we did have a lot of fun together."
  1561	
  1562		Yes they did, thought Kay.  But that all changed when he was
  1563	"recruited" by the government.  Still he couldn't blame the government for
  1564	what they did.  They did have a point about him protecting his country.  He
  1565	was being very selfish if he didn't use his special talents to protect
  1566	those who needed them.  His mother always told him that with great power
  1567	came great responsibility.  At times like these he really missed her..... 
  1568	
  1569	"Kay-kun, are you listening to me?!", Aih said, interrupting his thoughts.
  1570		"Oh sorry, Aih-san, my mind was just wondering a little..",
  1571		apologized Kay.
  1572	"Well pay attention, this isn't the classroom anymore.  If you make a
  1573	mistake it could mean more than a bad grade."
  1574		"Sorry.  So what were you saying?"
  1575	"I said, remember: Keep a low profile.  We're only here to observe."
  1576		Easy for you to say, thought Kay.
  1577		"Look, there's the Furinkan High campus", Kay said.
  1578	"Remember to be inconspicuous."   Aih gave a toss of her long hair and
  1579	stepped in past the gates.  Sighing, Kay followed in.

  1640	disoriented, anybody looking at him might have guessed he was traveling for
  1641	days.  The figure stops to rest a little.  He then notices a farmer nearby.
  1642	"Excuse me, do you know the way to Furinkan Koukou?", he asked.
  1643		"Sure, you just go straight down and take the first left.  You'll
  1644		be there in no time."
  1645	"Thank you"
  1646		"No problem.  You know, you're the forth person that asked me
  1647		that in two days.  Must be a popular place."
  1648	"Forth?", he said to himself as he went down the road and turned right.

  1650			*	*	*	*	*
  1651	
  1652		It was all over the school.  Even during these mournful times,
  1653	somethings never change.  Soon every one heard the news.  There were
  1654	new students at Furinkan high.  Everyone was curious to know what the new
  1655	people were like.  Gossip was already spreading like wildfire.
  1656	
  1657	"Hey, did you hear?"
  1658	"Yeah, a couple of new transfer students just came in"
  1659	"Boy did they pick the wrong time to come"
  1660	"Who cares, let's see what they're like."
  1661	"I heard one's a girl."
  1662	"Is she hot?!"
  1663	"What about the guy?"
  1664	"Oh, I heard he was the nice niave looking kind.  The type brainless over-cute
  1665	girls fall for"
  1666	"Yeah but *I* heard he looks a little older than normal"
  1667	"Maybe he was left back?"
  1668	"Let's go see!"
  1669	"But the sensei is taking a roll call."
  1670	"Big deal, with so many missing students he's not going to notice"
  1671	
  1672		In the classroom where the new students are being introduced, the
  1673	halls around it are filled with curious students from various other
  1674	classes.  At the front stood two students, waiting for the teacher to
  1675	finish roll call before introducing them.
  1676	
  1677	"Toyato"
  1678		"Here"
  1679	"Mishubusu"
  1680		"Present"
  1681	"Yotsuya"
  1682		'YO!'
  1683	"Yotsuya gets a zero for today....
  1684	 Godai"
  1685		This time no response was given.
  1686	"Godai
  1687	 Hmm, another missing student?"
  1688		"..... <gasp> Here!  I'm sorry I'm late Otonashi-sensei"
  1689	"Too late, I marked you as absent."
  1690		"But.. But..."
  1691	"You know the rules!  Don't argue with me!
  1692	 Next time come early, I have no time to waste on lazy students."
  1693		"Then if I'm marked as absent, I might as well leave."
  1694	"Do that and I'll have you assign you to wash the toilets for playing hookey."
  1695		".... <whimper>..."
  1696	"Tendo."
  1697		The teacher waits again only to be greeted with continued silence.
  1698	"Tendo Nabiki.
  1699	 ...
  1700	 Nabiki!"
  1701		Still no answer is given.
  1702	"Well, she probably just went to the bathroom...", the teacher nervously
  1703	marked her as present thinking about the compromising pictures she had of
  1704	him with a student.  He just got his new job and he wanted to keep it.
  1705	
  1706	"Kunou"
  1707		Again the teacher receives silence for an answer.
  1708	"Is Kunou hanging out at that 2nd year classroom again?
  1709	 If anyone sees him tell him if he wishes to repeat his 2nd year in high
  1710	 school, it can be arranged."
  1711	
  1712		Meanwhile the other students in the hall were passing the time
  1713		sharing more of the latest gossip.  In irritation the teacher
  1714		starts snapping at them. 
  1715	"You students in the hall!  If you don't talk more quietly I'll have you
  1716	 all dismissed back to your classrooms!"
  1717		The students immediately changed to whispering their gossip.
  1718	"And now, if there are no further interruptions, it gives me great pleasure
  1719	 to present two new visiting students.  Please introduce yourselves" 
  1720	
  1721		The young man Kay walked up.  Despite his age, he still looks as
  1722	innocent and niave as the first day he originally started high school.  He
  1723	had a nice homely look, with clear eyes and brushy brown hair. 
  1724		"My name is Kay Kai, but you can call me Kei.
  1725		 I am very pleased to be here.  I asked to be received with favor."
  1726	Kay bowed to a small applause.
  1727	
  1728		Next the girl walked up.  While Kay was an average looking student
  1729	Aih was definitely not.  She was a tall, thin and very attractive young
  1730	girl.  The class examined her carefully, from the tightness of her bright
  1731	white socks with matching shining dark shoes up to her long flowing skirt
  1732	and well formed blouse up to her perfectly chistled face and silky black
  1733	hair which was pleasantly draping over her shoulders and back.  She wasn't
  1734	just cute she was pretty, heart-stopping, gorgeous and cute.  She looked like a
  1735	goddess!  Every Otaku's dream girl and every school girl's role model.
  1736	Aih was the central role, the standard every other girl in an anime story
  1737	was measured up to.  She opened her large green luminous eyes wide and took
  1738	a deep breath before speaking, which gave the male students no end of delight. 
  1739	
  1740		"Hello I am..."
  1741	The deafening applause drowned out the rest of Aih's words.  The teacher put
  1742	up his hand to quiet the class.
  1743	
  1744		"..I am called Aih Em."
  1745	Again the fanfare of clapping hands rose up to various shouts from the
  1746	audience. 
  1747				"Hooray!"
  1748				"Wonderful!"
  1749	Again the teacher raised his hand to quiet them.
  1750	
  1751		"I am very pleased to be here...", Aih continued.
  1752	On cue the class erupted into praise again.
  1753				"Fantastic!"
  1754				"You're welcomed here"
  1755				"Are you busy Friday night?!"
  1756				"Do you have a boyfriend?"
  1757	This time the teacher stood up and gave a glare which said: Interrupt one
  1758	more time and you'll be VERY sorry.
  1759	
  1760		"Please accept me with favor.", Aih finished and sat down.
  1761	Yet again the students went crazy.
  1762				"More!"
  1763				"Speech!  Speech!"
  1764				"Do you want to have tea after school?"
  1765				"I think she's cool!"
  1766				"Were you ever a voice actress in an anime role?"
  1767	
  1768	The teacher lost all control of the situation and barely escaped being
  1769	overrun by overzealous students.
  1770	"Recess....", he said before being trampled.
  1771	
  1772			*	*	*	*	*
  1773	
  1774		Ranma awoke in the darkness.  Where is everyone?, he thought.
  1775	"We're right here Ranma!" a voice called out from the darkness.
  1776	"What?", Ranma wondered.  Then shapes started coming out.  It was everyone
  1777	one he knew.  Akane, his father, Kunou, Kodachi, Shampoo, her Great
  1778	Grandmother, Mousse, Happosai, Ukyou, Ryouga, Nabiki, Kasumi.  But
  1779	something was wrong with them.  They were all pale like...like the missing
  1780	people who attacked him.  "You failed us, Ranma...", they chanted and
  1781	advanced on him with their claws outstretched.  "You failed..."
  1782	No!  Ranma thought.  It's only a dream.  Just another dream.  And then
  1783	Nabiki bit him and Ukyou slashed his face.  "ARRH!", Ranma screamed in
  1784	pain.  "It's not a dream!  It's a nightmare!", Ranma yelled out.
  1785	But the legion continued, "You failed...."  "Stay back!  Please I tried my
  1786	best...!", Ranma pleaded, not sure what they were talking about, but he
  1787	wasn't about to argue with them.  Soon he was overwhelmed with the crowd.
  1788	But from the corner of his vision he saw a strange man wearing a long green
  1789	coat.  He seemed to be smiling wickedly at him.  And all the time he was
  1790	eating a bag of... popcorn?  Immediately Ranma woke up in a cold sweat.
  1791	
  1792	Ranma:	Oh my head... is this what a hangover feels like?
  1793	
  1794	Tofu:	Good morning Ranma, how are you feeling?  Your wounds have been
  1795		healing very nicely.
  1796	
  1797	Ranma:	Well, I'm a strong guy.  I always heal fast.
  1798	
  1799	Tofu:	You better eat something...
  1800		[ rolls in a cartful of food ]
  1801	
  1802	Ranma:	All for me?!
  1803	
  1804	Tofu:	Ranma, you need to build up your strength.
  1805		After all, you've been asleep for over 2 days.
  1806	
  1807	Ranma:	TWO days?!
  1808	
  1809	Tofu:	I was expecting three.
  1810	
  1811	Ranma:	Okay, so what now?
  1812	
  1813	Tofu:	Ranma, I have reason to believe that an army of bloodsucking
  1814		monsters will be the city.
  1815	
  1816	Ranma:	Why do you think that?
  1817	
  1818	Tofu:	Well, remember the six deceased.
  1819	
  1820	Ranma:	Yeah, Akane and I found the first one.
  1821	
  1822	Tofu:	I was asked to examine the bodies.  They were all almost completely
  1823		drained of blood.  And they had tiny puncture marks over their
  1824		jugulars. 
  1825	
  1826	Ranma:	But those people I fought...
  1827	
  1828	Tofu:	No, they were still alive in a sense: they were still warm blooded,
  1829		I managed to take some samples.  This is the part I didn't
  1830		understand.  They were nothing like the original victims. 
  1831	
  1832	Ranma:	So then are there two parties behind this?
  1833		One kidnapps, the other sucks people's blood?
  1834	
  1835	Tofu:	I can't say.  What I want to do is re-examine those six bodies
  1836		again.  This time I want a more thorough autopsy.
  1837	
  1838	Ranma:	But weren't they already buried?
  1839	
  1840	Tofu:	Ranma, how do you feel about a little grave robbing?...
  1841

  1843	
  1844		Outside the in the school yard, Aih was still being harrassed by a
  1845	bunch of students asking her out.  Aih just walked around the yard and
  1846	tried to them and until recess was over.  If anyone started getting to
  1847	pushy, she would just give them one of her classic icy stares that could
  1848	freeze a barbecue.  She didn't really care for the attention.
  1849	
  1850		From a distance Kay could only stare at her.  Every time someone
  1851	got too close to her he would just feel a twinge of jealously in his heart.
  1852	But he knew he could trust Aih-san, she wasn't that kind of punk girl to do
  1853	such things.  He kept telling himself to stop being so glum.  It wasn't as
  1854	if they were an item or anything.  Sure they'll were good friends, but that
  1855	was about it.  I mean the two of them never even really kissed.  Still,
  1856	deep down he wished they were closer.  Even all this time and all their
  1857	sharing, Kay still didn't really know exactly what kind of relationship
  1858	they had.  Perhaps he should confront her with his inner feelings, but times
  1859	like this, and from past experiences, he was just too afraid that the feelings
  1860	weren't mutual.  If things didn't work out, their friendship might never be
  1861	the same.  So he took the coward's way out.  He wasn't proud of it but it
  1862	was the only solution he could live and work with.  At this point just
  1863	being friends with Aih-san, to be near her, was enough for him.
  1864	
  1865	"Excuse, restaurant?"
  1866	
  1867		Kay yelped out in suprise and then scolded himself.  He would have
  1868	to stop his daydreaming in his line of work.  One mistake like this and he
  1869	could have been killed.  Then he saw the source of the voice.  It was from
  1870	a really cute blue-haired girl of about 15 or 16.  Her hair was arranged in
  1871	a cross between a ponytail and a criss-cross braid.  She must be chinese, he
  1872	thought.  For one thing she was wearing a chinese style top and pants in a
  1873	matching color of lavendar and.... 
  1874	
  1875	"Tell... Way.... Chinese.... Restaurant...", the girl continued.
  1876	
  1877	...she had a thick Chinese accent when she spoke.
  1878	
  1879		"Uh..., are you hungry?", Kay asked, not sure what to make of this.
  1880	
  1881	"Kay-kun, what do you think you're doing?!", Aih demanded.
  1882		"Whaaa!  Aih-san.", Kay exclaimed.
  1883	"What are you doing fratenizing with girls?!", Aih demanded.
  1884		How did she get here so fast?!, thought Kay.  And did he imagine it
  1885	but, did Aih-san look a little jealous?  That was good, that meant she
  1886	liked him at least a little.  But then again that was also bad since she
  1887	was a combat expert.  
  1888	
  1889	"You were supposed to keep a low profile and just observe, REMEMBER?", Aih
  1890	scolded. 
  1891		Then again mabye she wasn't.
  1892		"Well you see...", Kay stuttered.
  1893	
  1894	"Way... Chinese restaurant..", the girl persisted.
  1895		Aih finally noticed the girl.
  1896		"<Are you lost?>", Aih asked the girl in semi-fluent cantonese.++
  1897	"<You speak Cantonese?>", the girl asked, a little suprised.
  1898		Aih allowed herself a little smile.
  1899	
  1900	Aih:	<Just a little.  Are you lost?  Do you need any help?>
  1901	
  1902	Girl:	<Please forgive me miss.  I'm new here.  
  1903		I'm visiting a friend of mine but I'm not sure of the directions.>
  1904	
  1905	Aih:	<It's no trouble.  And please, call me Em.
  1906		What is the name of your friend's place.>
  1907	
  1908	Girl:	<The Nekohanten.>

  1912

  1916		number in case you need to reach me.>

  1925	Kay:	So what was that all about?
  1926	Aih:	Oh, she was just lost.  I helped her out.
  1927	Kay:	That was nice of you.
  1928	Aih:	It was no big deal.
  1929	Kay:	You know, I think you have a weakness for those
  1930		cute little sister types...
  1931	Aih:	Oh?  You think she's cute?
  1932		Do you think she was prettier than me?
  1933	Kay:	..No no!  I didn't mean...
  1934	Aih:	[ laughing ] Just kidding!
  1935	Kay:	So where was she heading?
  1936	Aih:	Oh, just this chinese restaurant called the Nekohanten....
  1937	Kay:	Hmm, now why does that name sound familiar...
  1938		What was her name anyway?

  2020	<end flashback>
  2021	
  2022	Ranma:	Me and my big mouth.
  2023	
  2024	[ Ranma sneaks into a building room.  He hears a commotion in the room.
  2025	  Ranma looks in, in the room he sees a tall man wearing dark blue robes.
  2026	  He is in the middle of decapitating someone's head, namely by ripping their
  2027	  head off.  Already two previous victims lie on the ground.  Anothe person
  2028	  tries to get away but the stranger quickly grabs him by the leg and pulls
  2029	  him in. ] 
  2030	
  2031	Ranma:	....!!
  2032	Stranger: You can't escape me, you fool.  Prepare for true oblivion...
  2033	Ranma:	I won't forgive you!
  2034	Stranger: What? [ turning ] 
  2035	
  2036	[ When the stranger turns we get to see his face. But he doesn't have one.
  2037	  Instead, a smooth stainless metal circular mask is in the middle of his
  2038	  hood, the only features on it being two small eye slits.  And on his
  2039	  chest seems to be the markings of four small bullet holes ]
  2040	
  2041	Ranma:	  ...Monster!
  2042	Stranger: Another one!
  2043	Ranma:	You will die for your crimes!
  2044	
  2045	[ Ranma takes a flying leap at the stranger only to encounter a puff of mist ]
  2046	
  2047	Ranma:	<cough!>  What..
  2048	
  2049	[ At the other end of the room, a swirl of mist starts forming,
  2050	  and a deep voice like the whail of a ghost calls out.. ]
  2051		I am the terror that guards in the night
  2052		I am the laser that burns away darkness
  2053		I am.... FireWater!+
  2054	
  2055	Ranma:	Is that your name or another metaphor?
  2056	
  2057	[ From within the mist, a form of a man appears, "FireWater" leaps out from
  2058	  it and tries to grab Ranma's neck.  Ranma quickly dodges and rolls out of
  2059	  range. ] 
  2060	
  2061	FireWater: Yes, you are a quicker one than these other deadbeats.
  2062	
  2063	Ranma:	You won't find me such easy prey like the others.
  2064	
  2065	[ Ranma throws a chair and throws it at him.
  2066	  FireWater easily catches it smashes it to pieces with his bear hands ]
  2067	
  2068	[ Ranma and FireWater trade blows for several minutes.  However as the
  2069	fight progresses, it is clear that Ranma is outmatched.  Ranma couldn't
  2070	dodge a side kick given by FireWater into his wounded side.  Groping in 
  2071	pain, Ranma just stood there while FireWater moved in to grab him a headlock ]
  2072	
  2073	FireWater: The last sound you hear will be the snapping of your own vertebra.
  2074	
  2075	Ranma:	.....
  2076	<CRACK!>
  2077			*	*	*	*	*
  2078	[ At the Nekohanten Resaurant ]
  2079	
  2080	Shampoo: Thank you please come again.
  2081		Next!  Please wait just a moment...
  2082	Girl:	<Shampoo!  Has it been so long you have forgotten me?>
  2083	Shampoo: <Lo-shin!>  [ She runs up to the girl and hugs her ]
  2084		<It's been so long since I've seen you at the village!>
  2085	Lo-shin: <We've all missed you.  I can't believe you're still here
  2086		chasing after that Ranma guy.  There are several more suitable
  2087		husbands for you.  And twice as manly too!>
  2088	Shampoo: <You know the custom.  I must be defeated by my husband.
  2089		So far Ranma was the only one to suceed.>
  2090	Lo-shin: <Please!  That's a stupid custom anyway.  Wakeup and smell the
  2091		herb tea!  This is the 20th century.  Besides, what about Mousse?
  2092		He's the strongest warrior from our village!  And he's not bad
  2093		looking too.>
  2094	Shampoo: <But what are we without our ancestry and customs of the people?
  2095		As for Mousse, I beat him when he was 3.>
  2096	Lo-shin: <That's not fair!  If you were to have a rematch, he would
  2097			defeat you soundly if he went all out.>
  2098	Shampoo: <Don't say such things.  He's too much of a wimp.
  2099		Anyway, what are you doing here in Japan?
  2100		You didn't come just by for a social call did you?>
  2101	Lo-shin: <Well, you're right.  The reason I came was to bring you an
  2102		important message.  I guarenteed it to arrive>
  2103	Shampoo: <You could have just mailed it.>
  2104	Lo-shin: <With the postal service?  You must be kidding.
  2105			We don't want you to receive it two months later!>
  2106	Shampoo: <What's the letter about?>
  2107	Lo-shin: <It's from your great grandmother.>
  2108	
  2109	[ Shampoo hurriedly opens the letter and starts reading it.
  2110	  Suddenly she starts crying.  Lo-shin tries to comfort her ]
  2111	
  2112	Lo-shin: <Shampoo, I'm sorry.  The attack occured two days ago.
  2113			There were no survivors.  I'm afraid she's dead. >
  2114	Shampoo: <That wasn't the worst of the news... >
  2115	Lo-shin: <There's worse?!>
  2116	Shampoo: <Lo-shin.... >
  2117	
  2118	[ There comes an explosion.  The door flies apart.  The two girls scream in
  2119	suprise and are buried under a small amount of rubble.  The girls groggily pick
  2120	themselves up.  A figure walks in. ]
  2121	
  2122	Mousse:	Shampoo!
  2123	
  2124	[ Strangely enough, Mousse is wearing DARK glasses ]
  2125	 
  2126	Shampoo: Mousse...?
  2127	
  2128	Mousse:	I have come for you.  You must suffer by my hand.
  2129	
  2130	[ Mousse roughly grabs Shampoo by the neck ]
  2131	
  2132	Shampoo: You're hurting me!
  2133	Mousse:	[ huskly ] No, not yet. 
  2134		I have much to pay you back, for all the humiliation you caused me.
  2135		I was completely devoted to you, but you threw me away to run after
  2136		some half/girl foreign Jap transvestite!+++
  2137	Shampoo: Well that was better than a half/duck blind wimp!
  2138	Mousse:	[ squeezing harder ] That's it Shampoo, make me angrier.
  2139	Shampoo: Mousse, you're killing me!
  2140	Mousse:	How does it feel Shampoo?  Do you enjoy me as the pure warrior?
  2141		Do you enjoy my new darker side?  No more holding back on you Shampoo.
  2142	 	It's time you learned what it means to be tamed by a real man!
  2143	
  2144	[ Suddenly Lo-shin appears and kicks Mousse in the chin ]
  2145	
  2146	Lo-shin: <Mouse what do you think you're doing?!>
  2147	
  2148	[ Mouse drops Shampoo but quickly recovers, he pulls out a mace out of his
  2149	sleeves and swings it at her.  His counter attack is so swift Lo-shin
  2150	couldn't dodge or block.  It hits her in the left rib area ]
  2151	
  2152	Mousse:	Stay out of this little girl!  This is a man's business!
  2153	Lo-shin: <Mousse, what happened to you?
  2154		Has living in this backwards country finally made you snap?
  2155		You used to be so nice...>
  2156	Mousse:	Let's just say, my eyes have been opened.
  2157	
  2158	[ Shampoo comes running back and manages to knock Mouse down.
  2159	  She's armed with her two "balloon" rods ]
  2160	
  2161	Shampoo: Lo-shin, run!  I'll hold him off!  Get help from Ranma!
  2162	Lo-shin: But...
  2163	Shampoo: He's crazy!  Go!  There's no time!  Please, for my sake go!
  2164	
  2165	[ Shampoo barely manages to block Mousse's sword attack.
  2166	  Lo-shin takes her cue and runs off ]
  2167	
  2168	Lo-shin: [thinking ] Mousse.
  2169	
  2170	Mousse: It didn't matter, I have no interest in her.  It's you I want!
  2171	Shampoo: Then come and get me!
  2172	Mousse:	Very well.  Just the two of us.  And only one shall stand...
  2173	
  2174	[ Shampoo and Mousse each face off.  Their gird themselves mentally as well
  2175	as physically.  Both prepare themselves for a clash of steel and strength
  2176	and of skill as well.  In a spring motion the two leap into battle with no
  2177	reservations.  The only purpose they have in their minds is to win and even
  2178	to kill if becessary.  Mousse and Shampoo duel off in a frenzy of thrusts,
  2179	counters and kicks .  In a sense it is a dance, deadly yet beautiful.  On
  2180	and on the two move about, as if in some great stage performance, each step
  2181	seems pre-planned and executed with complete grace.  But at last, the
  2182	dance must end, with only one victor and one crown. ]
  2183	
  2184	Mousse:	[panting] It's over Shampoo. 
  2185	
  2186	[ Shampoo lied on the ground, bruised and battered.  Her voice cracked with
  2187	gasps and coughs.  Her body overcome by spasms.  Her clothes torn and
  2188	scraped.  Her eyes wet with tears.  Most of all, her mind screaming at the
  2189	fact of her defeat and plauged by some unknown feeling of betrayal.  But
  2190	still she resisted, her mouth set in a deteremined lock.  She may be beaten
  2191	but she would never give up.  Her Great Grandmother taught her better ]
  2192	
  2193	Shampoo: What..What are you doing?
  2194	
  2195	[ Mousse stands over her with sword in hand, and moves in ever so slowly.
  2196	  The camera fades away and concentrates on the shadows.  The sword's
  2197	  shadow comes in close and enters Shampoo's trembling form.  We hear
  2198	  Shampoo struggling to control her terror, but soon it overwelms her and her
  2199	  cries pierce the air to be coupled by a sinister laugh, of one enjoying
  2200	  in another's suffering. ]
  2201	
  2202	Shampoo: What are you doing?!  Stop!!!
  2203	
  2204	[ In the shadows lies a piece of paper.  The camera moves in and we see
  2205	 it is the remains of the torn letter Shampoo received.  On it the following
  2206	 words are written: 
  2207	
  2208		"Shampoo, I might not last the next battle.  The tribe feud has
  2209		escalated into higher and higher levels than we could have imagined.
  2210		But the reason I'm writing is not about me.  Your childhood friend,
  2211		Lo-shin should be delivering you this message.  I have sent her
  2212		away from all this destruction.  Take care of her Shampoo.  I decided
  2213		that she would best take the news from you with the least amount of
  2214		pain.  When you feel she's ready, you duty is to inform her that
  2215		her entire family is not at the front battle lines, but that they
  2216		have already died defending the village.  Comfort her.  Raise her
  2217		up in the old ways.  You two may be our last seed.  Tell "son"
  2218		that he was a good rival and despite all our differences I respect.."
  2219	
  2220			*	*	*	*	*
  2221	[ From a distance we see Agent Green Coat.  He's munching on some popcorn ]
  2222	
  2223	Green:	Boy wasn't that just depressing?
  2224		A young man driven by his evil side to destroy what he loves the most.
  2225		Don't worry, we may be the bad guys, but we're not *that* bad.
  2226		After all, this series is just PG rated, we can't have too much gore
  2227		or we'll lose our kiddie market.
  2228		Good fight scene though.
  2229		[ turns away from audience  and walks into the scene ]
  2230		Hey Mousse!  Stop torturing her, we need her in one piece.
  2231	
  2232	Mousse:	What?!  But I didn't even shave her bald yet!  I didn't even get to
  2233		cut off her fingers one by one and laugh like it was incredibly funny.
  2234		You said I could make her suffer any way I wanted to once I
  2235		defeated her.  You promised! 
  2236	
  2237	Green:	Well too bad.  You know we want her body in one whole piece.
  2238		You already got to bruise her up pretty badly.
  2239	
  2240	Mousse:	No!  I want more blood!  More pain!
  2241		Besides how are you going to stop me?!
  2242	<SPLASH!>
  2243	Green:	Stupid question.
  2244	
  2245			*	*	*	*	*
  2246	<CRACK!>
  2247	[ The door to the morgue cabinet snaps open as one of the bodies crawls out ]
  2248	
  2249	FireWater: What!  More Fang foot soldiers.
  2250	Ranma:	Fang?!  What the heck is a Fang soldier?
  2251	FireWater: Don't play dumb with me, you...
  2252		Hey, kid you're sure bleeding a lot for an undead trooper.
  2253	Ranma:	Who's an undead trooper!?
  2254	
  2255	[ At Dr. Tofu's clinic ]
  2256	Tofu:	[ Looking in a microscope ]
  2257		From the samples I've taken, they bear remarkable similarities to
  2258		ledgendary vampires.  Maybe I should have told Ranma to go to the
  2259		morgue first thing in the morning.
  2260	
  2261	[ back at the town Morgue ]
  2262	FireWater: Then you're not an evil vampire monster?
  2263		[ Snaps the neck of another undead assailant ]
  2264	
  2265	Ranma:	Then you're not a kidnapping/murdering maniac?
  2266		[ Gives a chop at a lunging corpse ]
  2267	
  2268			*	*	*	*	*
  2269	[ In the Fang headquaters ]
  2270	
  2271	Commander: Report.
  2272	Purple:	All goes according to plan.
  2273		Green Coat reports that the target has been acquired and the
  2274		slave performed remarkably well.  Although it was a little
  2275		overzealous. 
  2276	Commander: Good, have him hit the next target: Utchan, with the other one.
  2277		Any word on the six?
  2278	Purple:	They should have finished their transformation tonight.
  2279		With any luck they'll be compelled to return here.
  2280	Commander: Good, anything else?
  2281	Purple:	Latest intelligence reports the Wandering one was seen headed in
  2282		this direction.
  2283	Commander: WHAT?!  Call central for reinforcements, if he should interfere...
  2284	Purple:	...this area will become a 500 feet deep hole at ground zero....

  2293	+ Yes, for those who watch DarkWing Duck, you'll recognize this
  2294	++ I am guessing she speaks the Cantonese dialect

  2336	Nabiki:	Hmm, I'm kind of dubious about all these missing persons.
  2337		Five people who owe me money just completely vanished.
  2338		Sister, did you notice some odd things happening in town?
  2339	
  2340	Kasumi:	Well, the night market seems less crowded than usual.

  2346		I hope they don't catch a cold.

  2479	Green:	Oh Great!
  2480	Purple:	Teleportation is one of the fastest, efficient and safest ways for
  2481		supernatural beings to travel.  What do you have against it?
  2482	Green:	Do you think I like having my atoms scattered all across time and
  2483		space?  Besides the guy never liked me.  I'm afraid he'll
  2484		sneeze in the middle of his spell and teleport me into a rock.

  2499		two extra agents?!
  2500	Taihen:	Well the budget is kind of tight right now and the Boss has other
  2501		things to do as well.   The Boss also said that you guys are way
  2502		behind schedule.  Everyone is waiting for this 13th town to be
  2503		subjugated for the completion of the...
  2504	Green:	...pow-er nex-us.  Yeah yeah yeah.  We know we know.
  2505	Purple:	The commander is going to have a fit.
  2506	Taihen:	Oh, by the way, intelligence also confirms that the Wandering one
  2507		is definately headed this way. 
  2508	Purple:	Great, just great!
  2509		Did any one bother to try and delay him?
  2510	Taihen:	And risk a confrontation?  Hey, we may be some of the toughest
  2511		operatives in the field but we're not crazy.

  2582		awaken.  
  2583	Ranma:	He's somewhat of an expert on the situation.
  2584	Tofu:	So, what is exactly going on?
  2585	
  2586	Man:	Okay... it's like this.  I have to warn you, this might be a
  2587		little hard to believe.  The group you are going up against is
  2588		ancient vampire guild called the Fang.  They have hordes of dark
  2589		minions and mystical might.  They're determined to conquer all of Asia.
  2590		By now they have worked themselves into a foothold in your city.
  2591		I've been trying to stop the Fang from doing that, which eventually
  2592		led me here. 
  2593		...
  2594		You don't believe me, do you?
  2595	
  2596	Tofu:	Why don't they want to rule the world?

  2602

  2604		myself.
  2605	Ranma:	....
  2606		Can we have a little more cooperation here?
  2607		We're only going to be risking our lives together.
  2608	
  2609	Man:	Alright, Alright, you're right.  I'm called FireWater, I'm sort of
  2610		a freelance agent that specializes in cases such as these.  But me
  2611		and the Fang go back, way back.  Almost two... a really long time.
  2612	
  2613	Ranma:	Is 'FireWater' your real name?
  2614	FireWater: Here's my library card.
  2615	Ranma:	"FireWater, Jo"
  2616	Tofu:	Do you always wear that mask?
  2617	
  2618	FW:	One, in my line of work, secrecy is of upmost importance.
  2619		Two, it strikes terror into the hearts of my enemies
  2620		Three, Trust me, you don't want to see my real face
  2621		Four, ... there is no number four
  2622	
  2623	Ranma:	I thought you were going to be serious.
  2624	FW:	I thought *we* were going to get down to business, not brown-nose.
  2625	Tofu:	Please continue, Mr. FireWater.
  2626	
  2627	FW:	Thank you.  The Fang's standard method of operation is to
  2628		infiltrate a city, destroy the local police force from within,
  2629		subjugate the local population and "recruit" any new troops.
  2630		Namely the most strongest fighters.
  2631	
  2632	Ranma:	So I may be next.
  2633	FW:	Perhaps, <snort!>
  2634	Tofu:	There's still a large number of alternatives.  And we have no idea
  2635		who haven't been targetted yet.  Can you narrow it down a bit further?
  2636	
  2637	FW:	Are any of your fighters pretty young girls?
  2638	Tofu:	I don't think this is exactly the time for...
  2639	
  2640	FW:	NO!!  It's not like that!  The absolute Fang leader has a
  2641		certain *taste* for cute strong girls.
  2642	
  2643	Tofu:	Maybe you *are* next, Ranma.
  2644	FW:	Can you give a listing?
  2645	Ranma:	Let's see, there's Shampoo, Ukyou, Akane...  
  2646		Akane!  I completely forgot about here!
  2647	
  2648	Tofu:	Ranma, calm down, I told Akane to leave the city two days ago.
  2649	Ranma:	Akane leave town?  That stubborn bratty girl will never listen!
  2650		She might be in danger!  I have to make sure!

  2691		you if she were on the other side of the country!

  2697	Kodachi: Hohohooho!  EIGHT!  EIGHT!  EIGHT! Hohohohoho!
  2698	
  2699		In the distance we see Ukyou stumbling away, clutching her injured arm.
  2700	She stops as if she hears something.  But then the pain from her wound snaps
  2701	her back to reality.  She then rips off part of her shirt for a makeshift
  2702	bandage.  "Darn!", she thinks.  "This is one of my better shirts."  Ignoring
  2703	her pain she gets up and continues on.  Behind her is a bright trail of blood.
  2704	
  2705			*	*	*	*	*
  2706	
  2707	Tofu:	What did you mean by: 'they destroy the local police force'
  2708	
  2709	FireWater: Well they all they sort of disappeared, didn't they?
  2710	
  2711	Tofu:	Yes, a while ago.  First the law enforcement, and then even the
  2712		direction guides vanished. 
  2713	
  2714	FireWater:	
  2715	It sounds like their standard procedure.  They usually pick a low police
  2716	level area.  If they can't find one they make it one.  First they help fight
  2717	crime to lower the police man-power.  Most officers then get transferred
  2718	out since there seems to be no need for so many officers.  Then the Fang
  2719	slowly take out who  ever's left.  The main police headquarters is usually
  2720	too swamped with paperwork to figure out exactly what's going on.  Instead
  2721	they just assume the police stationed there are getting too lazy with
  2722	inactivity, like closing the office and going fishing.  Then the Fang
  2723	operatives start kidnapping people for troops.  In fact that's how
  2724	I found this area looking for these specifications through the police
  2725	database records. 
  2726	
  2727	Tofu:	What were you doing in the police database?
  2728	
  2729	FW:	The same thing Ranma and I were doing in the morgue.
  2730	
  2731	Tofu:	What about the missing people Ranma encountered before, you say
  2732		they weren't vampire monsters?
  2733	
  2734	FW:	No, they were only mind induced slaves.  Usually a small "kiss"
  2735		from a vampire helps makes them into suscepible zombies.
  2736		Like vampires they dislike sunlight but it won't kill them.
  2737		
  2738	Tofu:	Why didn't they convert all their victims into vampires?
  2739	
  2740	FireWater:
  2741	The Fang still need servants that can operate unhindered by their own
  2742	restrictions.  Each victim must have more than 4 pints of blood drained
  2743	from their body and rest 3 days to transform into a vampire. They can't
  2744	always wait that long.  And there is only so much blood a single vampire
  2745	can drink at a time. 
  2746	
  2747	Tofu:	So all their prisoners are either all zombie slaves or transformed
  2748		vampires? 
  2749	
  2750	FW:	No, occasionally they keep live hypnotised spies.
  2751		They still have need of untainted sacrifices...
  2752	
  2753			*		*		*
  2754	
  2755		In the Fang headquaters, GreenCoat is showing the newly arrived
  2756	Taihen the various sites.  It is also a chance for old friends to become
  2757	reacquainted and talk about old times.
  2758	
  2759	"And that finishes the tour.  The place isn't that bad." GreenCoat finished. 
  2760		"Well, you should have seen the other place I was stationed.",
  2761		Taihen replied.  "You wouldn't believe it!  The girls there will
  2762		let you do anything to them if you just beat them up!
  2763		Oh wait, we just destroyed it.  Sorry guy." 
  2764	"Don't worry, we have a lot of cute girls here too.", GreenCoat assured his
  2765	friend.
  2766		"I see PurpleCoat hasn't changed.", Taihen remarked retrosepectively.
  2767	"Yeah, well don't mention it, okay?", GreenCoat warned.  "Purple still
  2768	hasn't forgetten about that incident with Jo.", GreenCoat said as he walked.
  2769	Genuine concern seemed to be on GreenCoat's face as he just kept staring at
  2770	the ground.  Suddenly he spun around grinning, "Hey, you hungry?"
  2771		"Starved!"
  2772	"Good, because we have about 100 people we need to transform into vampires."
  2773			*	*	*	*	*
  2774	
  2775	FireWater: Any luck calling the Tendo's?
  2776	Tofu:	No answer, that could mean the girls left...
  2777	FW:	Or that they were already captured.  Keep trying until Ranma
  2778		gets there to answer the phone.
  2779	
  2780	Tofu:	Excuse me, but what are those things on your chest?
  2781	
  2782	FW:	What these?  They're just bullet holes.
  2783	
  2784	Tofu:	Why do you have four bullet holes in your chest?
  2785	
  2786	FW:	Because the person missed twice, she was a really bad shot.
  2787		Just a minute [ flexes his chest  and four bullets pop out ]

  2839		The Fang Commander was getting more and more stressed every day
  2840	of the conquest.  If it wasn't one thing it was another.  The latest orders
  2841	concerning their conquest goals just made him more dismal than ever.
  2842	
  2843		"What is the status of the targets?", he was almost afraid to ask.
  2844	
  2845	"The first two targets were slightly injured but in satisfactory condition.
  2846	However the latest one, Kuonji, suffered an untimely demise.", reported
  2847	PurpleCoat in the usual calm collected voice the Fang Commander was used to.
  2848	
  2849		His own however wasn't, "What?!  What happened?!", he yelled.
  2850	
  2851	"Apparently the Kodachi-slave was a little overzealous, she practically
  2852	brought back a corpse.  Kuonji is no good to us in her present condition.
  2853	She's barely even recognizable.", explained PurpleCoat.
  2854	
  2855		"Where was GreenCoat when this was happening?  He was supposed to
  2856		be supervising.", I'm gonna kill him, the Commander thought.
  2857	
  2858	"He was taking in a movie when this happened.  He was so confident of the
  2859	 past preformance of the slaves, he thought that the slave could handle the
  2860	 operation independently.  It was a mistake, it won't happen again.  He has
  2861	 been properly disciplined.", Purple responded.
  2862	
  2863		"I don't think making him miss the newest episode of DeepSpace9 is
  2864		exactly disciplinary."
  2865	
  2866	"Oh, you don't know GreenCoat."
  2867	
  2868		The Commander sighed.  "Try and stabilize Kyonji's condition.
  2869		We may still be able to	use her later."  How in blazes are we
  2870		supposed to over take a city with such a sorry strike force?!",
  2871		he asked himself.
  2872	
  2873	"Well, sir, our new spy has come up with a plan to optimize our forces."
  2874	
  2875		How did PurpleCoat do that?  It was almost like mindreading, but
  2876		the Commander dismissed such a ridiculous thought.  Well it
  2877		couldn't hurt at this point to consider it.
  2878		"Very well, tell me the details."

  2890	Lo-shin: I... Lo-shin.
  2891	Ranma:	Lotion?
  2892	Tofu:	Well, get some rest Miss Lotion.
  2893	
  2894	[ outside the recuperation room ]
  2895	Ranma:	How is Utchan?
  2896	Tofu:	She should be alright, she just had a bad cut.
  2897		She just needs a little rest to heal.
  2898	FW:	Sorry, but they're not going to get it.
  2899		We need all the help we can get.
  2900	Ranma:	Wait a minute!
  2901	FW:	No!  Every minute we waste we're giving FANG a chance to get stronger.
  2902	
  2903	Soun:	He's right, whoever he is.
  2904	Ranma:	Mr. Tendo!
  2905	Tofu:	You shouldn't be up, you should be resting.
  2906	Soun:	No, if my city, my family, and my friends are in danger, I cannot rest!
  2907	FW:	Glad to hear that.
  2908		Vampires are a strong bunch.  We'll need every fighting person.
  2909	Soun:	Vampires...?!  Uh, I think I'm going to be ill...
  2910	FW:	No time for that now!  You don't have the luxuary.
  2911	Ranma:	Alright, let's go over what exactly we're up against.
  2912	
  2913	FW:	Vampires are super strong and highly impervious to harm
  2914	Tofu:	They can only be killed by a stake through the heart,
  2915		sunlight or decapitation.
  2916	Soun:	They drink blood.
  2917	
  2918	Ranma:	They can transform into night creatures or mist
  2919	Tofu:	But garlic retards their transformation powers and keeps them at bay.
  2920	Soun:	They drink blood.
  2921	
  2922	FW:	They can't enter a home uninvited.
  2923	Tofu:	They can also control animals and the weather.	
  2924	Soun:	They drink blood.
  2925	
  2926	FW:	Vampires have powerful hypnotic ability by catching eye contact.
  2927	Ranma:	They can be frightened off by religious symbols
  2928	Soun:	They drink blood.
  2929	Ranma:	Will you cut that out!  We're already spooked enough as it is.
  2930	
  2931	FW:	They don't age.
  2932	Tofu:	They can be harmed by silver and holy water.
  2933	Soun:	They must feed, on average, every other night to avoid losing their
  2934		strength, and they feed by drinking blood.
  2935	
  2936	FW:	But that's not all.  Higher level FANG vampires can also develop
  2937		magical powers such as mind control, teleportation, spell casting
  2938		and worse.  They can even negate some of their mystical restrictions.
  2939		... but they still drink blood, they like the taste.

  2942	Commander: Are you in tune with the Wanderer?
  2943	Purple:	Yes, unless he masks his presence, some one of his caliber is hard
  2944		to ignore. 
  2945	Commander: Spell-caster, are you ready?!
  2946	
  2947	[ In response, the woman in the hooded robe just nods ]
  2948	
  2949	Purple:	Wait, I feel him, he's coming!
  2950	Commander: He's ahead of schedule!
  2951	Purple:	Closer...
  2952		Closer!
  2953	Commander: Get that spell up!!
  2954	
  2955	Purple:	He's Here!!!!
  2956	
  2957	Green:	We're too late!
  2958	
  2959	Purple:	Wait... He's going...
  2960		Going...
  2961		Gone!
  2962		He passed us!
  2963	
  2964	[ Everyone collapses in a pile of groans ]

  3027		Officer Zen was busy doing his paperwork when he had one of his
  3028	premonitions.  He wasn't sure how it happens.  Whenever something pivotal
  3029	was about to happen, he would just get one of his feelings.  Having nothing
  3030	else to do, he poured himself two cups of tea.  Right on cue, Dr Kno burst
  3031	into his office without even bothering to knock.  He was going to have to
  3032	remind Dr. Kno of proper etiquette.
  3033	
  3034	"Officer Zen..!", Dr. Kno started.
  3035		"Have some tea, cream no sugar, correct?", Zen offered.
  3036	"Umm yes.  I have some bad news..."
  3037		"We've lost contact with the team"
  3038	"Yes, how did you..."
  3039		"How do I always know?  Trust me, if I knew how I know, you'd be
  3040		 the first to know, Dr. Kno.  Anyway I had a bad feeling about this.
  3041		 I think we should send	in E.S.P.E.R. EPSILON."
  3042	"Are you crazy?!  We haven't even finished running all the tests!
  3043	 It's the ESPolice's newest..."
  3044		"I know, I know, Doctor.  But I've got a hunch that our team is
  3045		going to need all the help they can get."
  3046	"Let's not get carried away.  After all anything could have happened.
  3047	Maybe they just forgot to check in.  Maybe Kay-kun broke the transmitter again.
  3048	Maybe..."
  3049		"Maybe he and Em-chan are just in grave danger and the only thing
  3050		that can save them is our most powerful unit."
  3051	"But.."
  3052		"Dr., No.  The issue is closed.  You have your orders."
  3053	"Yes SIR"
  3054		"Dr. Kno, please try not to forget, I'm you're superior officer."
  3055	"It's hard to sir, you keep reminding me all the time."
  3056		"Well, I'm just afraid you might be getting senile in your old age."
  3057	"I'm only 46."
  3058		"Exactly."
  3059	    Dr. Kno slammed the door on the way out.  "He didn't even thank me for
  3060	the tea, he's so rude.", Zen thought.

  3101	Tofu:	I just had the place redecorated.  All plastic and steel.

  3205		The zombies are too weak to handle this group and I can't enter a 
  3206		house uninvited.  Blast, I knew I should have brought the
  3207		Dark-slaves as backup.
  3208	Spy:	I've got an idea.
  3209	Green:	Oh you.  What is it, you mere mortal.
  3210	Spy:	Well, I was just thinking.  You can't enter a home without first
  3211		being invited, right?
  3212	Green:	Yeah.
  3213	Spy:	But do you have any restrictions on the home itself?
  3214	Green:	Other than being unable to enter it, no.
  3215	Spy:	So what will happen if there is no more home to enter?
  3216	Green:	[ smiling ] I see.  No more home, no more restriction.

  3276	THE STORY SO FAR:
  3277	
  3278		Investigating a series of murders and massive kidnapping crimes,
  3279	Ranma and the others encounter an army of zombie killers.  Little did they
  3280	know, they actually stumpled onto a secret army of a more deeper and darker
  3281	plot.  A secret clan of Vampire conquerors known as the Fang plan to use
  3282	the city and it's people as a pivotal point to hatch a power structure in
  3283	which they can rule all of Japan.  Already Mousse, Kunou, Kodachi, and
  3284	Gosunkugi have fallen to their dark dominion.  Skirmishes have occured and
  3285	prisoners have been taken.  Genma, the Tendo Household, Shampoo and many
  3286	more may already have been taken prisoner, killed or worse.  The
  3287	ramifications are so powerful, two government agents, Aih and Kay,
  3288	specializing in paranormal activities, have been sent in to investigate.  
  3289	
  3290		Currently the last possible fighting chance seems to lie within
  3291	Ranma, Dr. Tofu, Soun, Ukyou, Lotion, who unknown to herself, may be the
  3292	last of Shampoo's tribe in China, and the mysterious FireWater, a
  3293	supernatural specialist who has previously dealt with the Fang.  There is
  3294	also an unknown factor, only known as: The Wanderer, who's ultimate motives
  3295	and abilities are as yet unknown.  However this entity is highly feared by
  3296	the Fang for unknown reasons.  The current Fang strike force consists of
  3297	it's commander and two operatives known only as PurpleCoat and GreenCoat
  3298	who have an absolute leader known only as the Boss.  To boost of their
  3299	power they have recived reinforcements in the form of Taihen and a mystic
  3300	spellcaster. 
  3301		Recently the Government Central has lost contact with special
  3302	agents Aih and Kay, and the Wanderer has been seen headed away from the city
  3303	while Ranma and the others face a fiery deathtrap by GreenCoat and his
  3304	zombie mob....

  3325	hurling burning blocks at the surrounding forces. ]
  3326	
  3327	Green:	Impossible!
  3328		UHH!  [ he gets hit by a fiery flagstone ]
  3329	
  3330	[ From the heart of the cyclone six figures fly out as the cyclone
  3331	disperses.  The rest of the zombies are too disoriented from the
  3332	whirlwind to try and stop them. ]
  3333	
  3334			*	*	*	*	*
  3335	
  3336		In a remote open field, a top secret weapon was about to start it's
  3337	trial run begins.  Around the area stands a huge hanger with various
  3338	helicoptors and jeeps surrounding it.  At the mobile command center are
  3339	Officer Zen and Dr. Kno. 
  3340		"I think this is a mistake", Dr. Kno kept on saying.  He said
  3341	it over and over again ever since Zen first brought up the suggestion.
  3342	Dr Kno said it to him when they left headquaters.  He said it again over
  3343	and over on the way to the launch site.  And he said it again when he
  3344	assigned the test pilot to the unit.  And he said it again even when the
  3345	operation passed the point of no return.  Zen was getting very tired of
  3346	the Doctors' non-ceasing prattle.  He must have politician blood in him,
  3347	Zen thought, he's heard more interesting fillibusters.
  3348		"I think this is a mistake"
  3349	If he didn't shut up, he was going to shoot him.  It was almost amazing, he
  3350	kept on saying it every three minutes exactly.  In fact..., Zen held the
  3351	thought as he checked his timer as it reached zero...
  3352		"I think this is a mistake"
  3353	"Dr. Kno, could you please be quiet, the decision has been made and the
  3354	launch will go ahead according to schedule.  We can't call it off now."
  3355	
  3356		The transport already brought out E.S.P.E.R. Epsilon.  The unit was
  3357	on it's back, over 100 feet long.  It's super steel alloy gave off a
  3358	dazzling luster like silver.  It's armaments consisted of internal cannons
  3359	capable of emmitting explosive bullets at a rate of 500 rounds per second.
  3360	High accuracy laser torches gave limited range cutting ability which could
  3361	slice apart even diamond.  A wide range capability missle rack was stored
  3362	on it's back with armaments anything from smoke bombs to putty grenades to
  3363	smart missles to a sub-atomic bomb.  It's main armament was a highly
  3364	charged electro-plasma blaster which had enough firepower to level a
  3365	mountain.  And the best thing about Epsilon was it's cool sleek appearance
  3366	which would tell, anybody looking at it, that it was indeed as impressive as
  3367	it seemed.  Designing the system was indeed a challenge for the mechanical
  3368	team.  They had to hire a specialist group in theoretical mecha designs
  3369	from a out-of-business toy company.  But now looking at the final product,
  3370	Zen had to agree, they really knew how to design neat looking mecha.
  3371	Not only did it have a really good offense, but it was built with a personal
  3372	energy shield guard to protect itself.  And even if the shield was
  3373	overloaded, the unit was armored so much, only a near fatal hit could even
  3374	dent it.
  3375		The launch stage began.  The transport activated the hydralic pumps
  3376	to lift up the EPSILON unit in a incline.  Slowly but surely, EPSILON got
  3377	onto it's feet.  Similarly of all stereotypical mechas, this one had a very
  3378	suspicious humanoid look to it.  As the sunlight gleamed off it's armor,
  3379	Zen wished all the ESPolice's activities weren't so classified.  They could
  3380	have made a fortune marketing their mecha as a toy line or merchandising
  3381	them on lunch boxes, pencil cases or even have their own animated series
  3382	debut.  It would even work since they had actual models to compare to.
  3383		"Initiate take-off procedure.", Zen ordered through the
  3384		communications channel.
  3385	"Yes, sir!", the test pilot barked back on the channel.
  3386		"I STILL think this is a mistake", Dr. Kno sulked.
  3387	
  3388	EPSILON first took a step, and then another to get into position.  But then
  3389	the entire unit started rocking.  Joints creaked and infrastructured
  3390	started crumbling.  First it just started with a loose screw, but then it
  3391	was followed by many more until the entire outer armor came crashing down.
  3392	
  3393		All the technicians and escorts scattered about taking cover from
  3394	the falling debris.  When the dust finally settled and the large mecha's
  3395	form finally remained still, one by one everyone crawled out from their
  3396	cover and just stood out in the lawn just staring blankly out at the
  3397	disaster.  
  3398		"I KNEW this WAS a mistake", Dr. Kno simply said.
  3399	"Apparently the unit's armor was too massive.  It couldn't support it's own
  3400	weight.", explained a technician while checking his readouts.
  3401	"Would you call it a design flaw or a construction flaw?", another
  3402	technician asked candidly.
  3403		"Who's idea was it to put some much armor?!", Zen demanded.
  3404	"It was the theoriticians, they said it was a psychological advantage:
  3405	 It's important to intimidate the opposition and protect the unit from any
  3406	possible serious attacks", the technician explained. 
  3407		"But of couse the only experience they have is building those
  3408		little plastic toys...", a second technician pointed out.
  3409	"And all the Emperor's techies and all the Emperor's men,
  3410	 couldn't but back poor EPSILON back together again.", finished yet a third.
  3411		"I knew this was a bad idea", Dr. Kno repeated.
  3412	"Will you all please shutup!", Zen was on the verge of losing his temperature.
  3413		"Well, we had to test EPSILON sooner or later and the result would
  3414		have been the same.", consoled the first technician.
  3415	"I still say we should have had more stress testing before rushing to 
  3416	activating the unit", argued the second technician.
  3417		"That's not important right now.  What's important is that we have
  3418		 two agents who may be in grave danger.  Fall back to the secondary
  3419		plan, get a sqadron of Gamma units and head into the target area",
  3420		ordered Zen, trying to regain some semblance of command.
  3421	"I think this is a mistake", predicted Dr. Kno.
  3422		"Will you just get going!", Zen screamed.
  3423	
  3424	Immediately the area was dispersed.  People running around, following the
  3425	new commands.  Speed and time was of importance.  It was the well ordered
  3426	machine-like operation of the force that gave it its strength.  In seconds
  3427	everyone was already at work at their new tasks.  The only thing that
  3428	remained of the day's fiasco was the smoldering pile of junk remaining that
  3429	was once the proud mecha known only as: E.S.P.E.R. Epsilon and a low voice
  3430	emminating from the wreckage.  
  3431		"Can someone please help me out of here?", the test pilot groaned
  3432	out weakly.  "Help, I'm trapped in here, I think my leg's broken... Can
  3433	anybody hear me?  Is anybody out there?  Okay joke's over... HELP!"
  3434	
  3435			*		*		*
  3436	
  3437	GreenCoat:	What happened?  Oh my head...
  3438			I feel as if someone dropped a 100 ft mecha on top of me.
  3439	Zombie:	Commander...
  3440	Green:	How many times do I have to tell you, I'm not your commander.
  3441		Your COMMANDER is some overbearing meglomaniac.
  3442		I am your squad captain.  Cal me Captain, 'Keptin Koat'.
  3443	Zombie:	Aye sir... They... gone...
  3444	Green:	The people in the building?
  3445	
  3446	[ The zombie just nods ]
  3447	
  3448	Green:	Blast!  Do a low level search sweep around the local area...
  3449	
  3450	<Cock-a-doodle-doo!>
  3451	
  3452	Zombie:	Sun-light!!!
  3453

  3457	[ In the area of Ukyou's store: Utchan ]
  3458	
  3459	FireWater:	Is every one okay?
  3460	Ukyou:	I'm sorry about the mess, but Kodachi pretty much tore it apart.
  3461	Ranma:	I can't believe you made us come here.
  3462	FW:	It's an old trick, they'll never expect us to come back to a place
  3463		they already trashed.  And they trashed this place pretty badly.
  3464	Ukyou:	Dr. Tofu, I'm so sorry about your clinic...
  3465	Tofu:	Don't worry, I have disaster and fire insurance.
  3466		You can't live here without it.
  3467	Soun:	You're quite right Dr. Tofu.
  3468	Ukyou:	Wish I knew that...
  3469	
  3470	Ranma:	That technique... how...
  3471	FireWater: It's one of my special techniques.  I invented it a long time ago...
  3472		You see, the whole point is staying cool while..
  3473	Ranma:	.. your opponent gets hot trying to hit you while you spiral into
  3474		the center of a circular path.  And then you throw your..
  3475	FW:	...cool punch and create an artificial whirlwind.
  3476		So you've heard of it.
  3477	Ranma:	I was taught it!
  3478	FW:	Impossible, I only shared the secret to one person...
  3479	Ranma:	But how did you make that flaming cyclone?
  3480	
  3481	FW:	When you fully master the technique, you can use it against any
  3482		hot source closing in against you.  By concentrating and staying calm,
  3483		the cool punch can be used offensively in this manner and gain
  3484		total control of the resulting inferno whirlwind.
  3485		Otherwise the techinique is just a very limited defensive method.
  3486	
  3487	Ranma:	But...
  3488	Tofu:	I think there are more important things to discuss now.
  3489	FW:	We'll talk about it more later, Ranma.
  3490		Right now we need a plan.
  3491		The Fang are going to be hunting for us now.  We're the only thing
  3492		that is standing in their way from total dominance of the city.
  3493	Ranma:	I say we go on the offensive for a change!
  3494	Lotion:	Lotion agree!
  3495	
  3496	FW:	Let's list our options.
  3497		(1) Right now, time is on our side, we have all day to prepare.
  3498		    Are there any in the city who could help us.
  3499	
  3500	Ranma:	I doubt it.  No one is skilled enough to be any real help.
  3501	
  3502	FW:	Fine then, it's up to us.
  3503		(2) We have to find their base of operations and figure out what
  3504			their ultimate goals are. 
  3505		(3) We also need to try and assess their strength and power,
  3506		    as well anyone they may have converted.  And we should try
  3507		    to guess who might be their Dark-Slaves.
  3508	
  3509	Ranma:	Dark-Slaves?
  3510	FW:	Sort of a converted fighter.  They are neither zombies nor vampires
  3511		but a dedicated slave-warrior to the Fang.
  3512	Ranma:	How are they converted?
  3513	FW:	They're sort of coerced.. sort of seduced.
  3514		A recognizable detail is glaring red eyes.
  3515		Do we know of any?
  3516	Ukyou:	Well, I had an encounter like that with Kodachi.
  3517	Lotion:	Lotion know of one also.
  3518	FW:	Who?
  3519	Lotion:	His name.... Mu-so...

  3522	[ The scene is a dungeon.  Chained up on one of the walls is Akane.
  3523	  She looks worse than she actually is.  Her clothes are faded and filthy,
  3524	  and she has a couple of blisters over her body.  She starts to stir.. ]
  3525	
  3526	Akane:	Uhh, where am I?  What happened to me?
  3527		Hard to remember....
  3528	
  3529	< Slowly her thoughts fade back to the events three days ago 
  3530	 during the thunderstorm when Ranma and the others went investigating >
  3531	
  3532	Akane:	Hello, I'm home.  I'm sorry I took so long.
  3533	
  3534	[ Lightening flashes, Thunder roars ]
  3535	Nabiki:	Hello Akane, welcome home.
  3536	
  3537	Akane:	Oh Sister!  You startled me.  Where's Kasumi?
  3538	
  3539	Nabiki:	She had to go.
  3540	[ More storm effects ]
  3541		Now Kunou!
  3542	
  3543	Akane:	Kunou?!
  3544	[ Kunou walks in, his sword drawn, and wearing dark glasses.
  3545	  He doesn't waste any time for opening jests and he immediately strikes
  3546	  to kill.  Akane barely blocks and goes on the defensive.  But Kunou
  3547	  doesn't let up and continues on the offensive.  It becomes very apparent
  3548	  that Akane is going to lose not only the fight but possibly her life. ]
  3549	
  3550	Nabiki: Kunou you idiot!  What's taking you so long?
  3551		Can't you do anything right?!
  3552	
  3553	[ Attempts to knock out Akane with a vase but misses and hits Kunou ]
  3554	
  3555	Kunou:	OWWW!!
  3556	Nabiki:	Whoops!
  3557	
  3558	[ Akane sees her opening and manages to knock Kunou out with a good
  3559	  kick to the face. ]
  3560	
  3561	Akane:	Sister!!  What's going on?
  3562	Nabiki:	Akane....
  3563	Voice:	What she's trying to say is that the fight's over...
  3564	
  3565	[ The storm reaches it's climax ]
  3566	Akane:	[ to herself ] What, a hand on my shoulder...  ARRGGH!!
  3567	Voice:	...and you lose.
  3568	
  3569	Nabiki:	What did you do to her?!
  3570	GreenCoat: I just gave her my Vulcan Nerve Pinch.
  3571	Nabiki:	I think you broke her collar bone.

  3579	  alone.  On the opposite wall is Kasumi, likewise chained up but seems to
  3580	  be unconsious.  However in front of her is a strange man ]
  3581	
  3582	Akane:	What?  Sister!  [ tries to break free ]
  3583		Ow!  My shoulder...
  3584	
  3585	[ The man hears Akane and turns around. ]
  3586	Taihen:	Hmm, ah, you're finally awake.
  3587	Akane:	Who are you?   What are you doing with my sister?
  3588	Taihen:	I'm your warden.  It would be best to be nice to me.
  3589	kane:	Wh..what..
  3590	Taihen:	My, you're such a fiesty little girl...
  3591		[ He lifts up Akane's chin with his hand ]
  3592	
  3593	Akane:	Get your hands off of me!
  3594	Taihen:	Heh heh, oh come on, I'm only trying to be nice to you.
  3595		But if you want me to leave you alone, there's always
  3596		your pretty sister over there.
  3597	Akane:	....	
  3598	Purple:	What do you think you're doing?  These two aren't to be touched.
  3599	Taihen:	Ulp!  PurpleCoat, I .. uh..
  3600	Purple:	I see you haven't changed a bit.  Get out of here, the next time I
  3601		see you down here, it'll be as a prisoner. 
  3602	Akane:	Th-thank you.
  3603	Purple:	Don't bother.  I didn't do it for you.
  3604		You wouldn't be harmed, as long as you don't do	anything stupid.
  3605		You are our prisoner, don't ever forget that. 
  3606	Akane:	Why are you doing this?
  3607	Purple:	...
  3608		[ PurpleCoat just leaves ]
  3609	
  3610			*	*	*	*	*
  3611	Commander: What happened to the last bit of resistance?
  3612	Purple:	Unfortunately they escaped.
  3613	
  3614	Commander: There is still this Ranma person, the two girls he brought with
  3615		him to the clinic, Dr. Tofu and the head of the Tendo Dojo all
  3616		unaccounted for.  They seem to be the last obstacle this town has
  3617		to offer.  Still, there are too many variables.  What if they had
  3618		an army we didn't know about holed up in there? 
  3619	
  3620	Purple:	In the short time they had, the strike force searched the remains and
  3621		found a skeleton buried in the rubble.  We didn't have time to look
  3622		for any more remains but it is possible a good number of them did
  3623		not survive the siege.  And as  far as we know, no one else in this
  3624		town can offer any meaningful resistance.
  3625	
  3626	Commander: Any news of outside interference?
  3627	Purple:	Well the last Intellgence report says the renegade is still being
  3628		held in his prison cell. 
  3629	Commander: And how is the spell holding up?
  3630	Purple:	It is working perfectly, as long as the spell-caster is
  3631		concentrating on it.  Even if the renegade or the Wandering one
  3632		manages to arrive they'll never find the city.
  3633	Commnader: Good.  Now, tell me a little more about your new spy...
  3634	
  3635	Nabiki:	I believe I can speak for myself.
  3636	
  3637	[ Nabiki steps from out of the darkness wearing her very revealing dress
  3638	  from the 2nd Ranma 1/2 movie, which everyone on shampoo-l seems to love :-) ]
  3639	
  3640	Nabiki:	Are you the leader?  Hello.
  3641	Taihen:	I trust her....
  3642	Purple:	Stop drooling.
  3643	Commander: She stinks of free will.
  3644		Why didn't you indoctrinate her like the other zombie troops?
  3645	Nabiki:	Commander!  A person as intelligent as you must realize that
  3646		someone of my skills can best serve you with my full wits about me.
  3647		Becoming a zombie somehow makes a person a little brain dead.
  3648	Commander: I don't know.  Why should we trust you?
  3649	Purple:	We made a deal with her.  Her services and loyalty for..
  3650	
  3651	Nabiki:	..money, power and freedom.
  3652	
  3653	Green:	Her ideas were very helpful...
  3654	
  3655	Commander: Very well, I'll accept you as one of our own, outsider, for now.
  3656		Then you know what to do next, don't you, GreenCoat?
  3657	Green:	Yes.
  3658		Gosunkugi!
  3659	Gosunkugi: Yes, Master?
  3660	Green:	You'll be rewarded very well for your dedicated service...
  3661	Gosunkugi: I live only to serve...
  3662	Green:	You weren't a bad slave, I'll kind of miss you.
  3663	Gosunkugi: Thank you, Master.
  3664	Purple:	Just get it over with.
  3665	
  3666	[ GreenCoat rips into Gosunkugi's throat, suprisingly, Gosunkugi doesn't
  3667	  cry out  but instead lets out a sort of sigh.  If Nabiki is shaken at the
  3668	  inhumanity she just witnessed, she doesn't show it.]
  3669	
  3670	Commander: It is done.  He will rise as a full glorious Fang warrior
  3671	Purple:	That's enough, Green, you can stop now.
  3672	Green:	SLURP!  He should eat more iron, his blood tastes weak.
  3673	Commander: Now we can engage the next phase.

  3677		Sleep is meant to be relaxing, restful.  But at times it can also
  3678	be a frightening experience, where the mind must face it's deepest darkest
  3679	secrets and fears.  This is the time when the id and ego collide.  One such
  3680	figure is facing this delimna.  He is lying alseep, but it is not a
  3681	peaceful one.  The man tosses and turns.  Everywhere, he hears voices,
  3682	a hodgepodge of all levels, ages and sexes.  Sometimes the voices  
  3683	sound familiar, yet at other times they seem like total strangers.  Night
  3684	by night he has been plagued by the same dream, the voices are always
  3685	different but the content remains the same:
  3686	
  3687		"But Father, he is one of my most faithful servants!"
  3688	"No, he has refused my gift.  No man may insult me in this way, no man!"
  3689		"If he must go, then we all shall follow."
  3690	"No one will ever aid you or even mention your name."
  3691		"I am no hero, I am just.. myself.   And I must be true to myself."
  3692				"Farewell."
  3693	"You will face doom at the end of your path"
  3694			"DOOM!"
  3695	
  3696	With a start he wakes up.  Breathing deeply he reminds himself that
  3697	they are only dreams, only dreams.  They cannot harm him.  But he takes
  3698	little comfort from it, something big is happening.  He does not even
  3699	bother trying to return to his slumber.  The recent events have been
  3700	puzzling even to himself.  But the only thing he knows is that he must
  3701	reach his destination without fail.  He has this unquenchable drive to
  3702	continue.  He gathers his few belongings in the dusk and restarts his
  3703	journey.

  3771	
  3772	Green:	So what does this spell exactly do?
  3773	Taihen:	It bankets the city with an inhibition field.  It doesn't work
  3774		in the physical sense, it works more subtly.  Any personal or
  3775		signal attempting to come into the city will be passively sidetracked.
  3776		The outside world will never find their way here.
  3777		And that includes the Wanderering one.  Understand?
  3778	Green:	Yeah, sort of...
  3779		So what is this next spell supposed to be doing?
  3780	Taihen:	This one is called: "Eternal Night"
  3781		Using our natural weather controlling powers, we pool all our
  3782		resources into this continuous thunderstorm over the city.
  3783		This way the sun is blocked out leaving us free to operate whenever
  3784		we wish.
  3785	Green:	Cool!  Now I can get the early bird special!
  3786	Taihen:	You know, PurpleCoat is sure acting like a real ..
  3787	Green:	Don't say it!  Purple will know...
  3788	Taihen:	Well, I was just going to get some laughs, you know?
  3789		With the prisoners in Basement Block San, and I was practically
  3790		chased out of there by...
  3791	Green:	Whoa!   That Block is restricted and off limits.  It's sort of a
  3792		deal we made.
  3793	Taihen:	What?!  Who is the moron that made it?
  3794	Green:	Actually it was me.
  3795	Taihen:	Whoops, sorry, I didn't mean it like that...
  3796	Green:	Don't worry about it.  I was kind of suckered into it.
  3797		I was a moron.  Anyway if you want to have some fun, I know this
  3798		really HOT chick in Block Nee...
  3799	Taihen:	Lead on!
  3800		By The Way, Whatcha eating?
  3801	Green:	Oh this gaijin snack called 'popcorn'
  3802	Taihen:	How can you eat that western junk food?
  3803	Green:	Hey, as a matter of fact that's exactly what this food is called.
  3804	Taihen:	'Junk food?'  You're kidding me!
  3805	Green:	No!
  3806			*	*	*	*	*
  3807	
  3808	Lotion:	How we know where to strike?
  3809	Soun:	Their headquarters could be anywhere!
  3810	FireWater: I have special sensory perceptions when concerned with the Fang.
  3811		I can locate their base of power.
  3812		Just give me some time to concentrate...
  3813	
  3814	[ The others are watching the storm building up outside a window ]
  3815	Ranma:	Hmm, I wonder why Kunou mansion is glowing like that.
  3816	
  3817	FW:	Their mystic nexus is concentrated around... here!
  3818	Tofu:	According to this map, that position is known as Kunou Manor.	
  3819	
  3820	FireWater:	We don't have much time, we're going to have to hurry.
  3821		Since Dr. Tofu and I have experience in masking
  3822		our presence, he and I will try to infiltrate directly into
  3823		their main headquarters undetected.
  3824		Ranma and Lotion, you two will try and free any prisoners,
  3825		be careful, it may already be too late for them.
  3826		Mr. Tendo and Ukyou, look around and try and find anything useful.
  3827		Be careful, if you recognize anyone, remember they could have been
  3828		converted to the other side.  Strike first, ask questions later.
  3829	
  3830	FireWater: Let's go! go!  Fang-busters!
  3831	Ranma:	Fang-busters?
  3832			*		*		*
  3833	
  3834	Purple:	Her plan was to use a substitute with those two dark-slaves.
  3835		Normally they would only operate up to their full potential given
  3836		a smooth cold surface... Ah!
  3837	Commander: PurpleCoat, what is it?
  3838	Purple:	I felt a disturbance.... something familar.
  3839		He's here.
  3840	Commander: What?  Who's here?
  3841	Purple:	Oh very clever... Masking your presence like that.
  3842		You really fooled us... but I know you too well.
  3843	Commander: What is going on?
  3844	Purple:	Commander, we are about to find those loose ends we were worried about.
  3845		In fact, they're coming here to invade us any minute now.
  3846	
  3847	[ Thunder crackles outside ]
  3848			*		*		*
  3849	FireWater: Split up!  Remember, suprise and stealth are on our side!
  3850	
  3851	Ranma:	Let's hurry before this drizzle gets any worse!
  3852	
  3853			*		*		*
  3854	
  3855	Green:	Anyway, then I said: "No no no, it's not a pentagram it's a.. a.."
  3856	Taihen:	What is it?
  3857	Green:	I'm getting a signal from Purple.  We're being invaded.
  3858		Go to Red Alert.
  3859	Taihen:	Still watching Star Trek I see....

  3865	Ranma:	Thanks.
  3866	Lotion:	But could be better.
  3867	Ranma:	...thanks...
  3868	
  3869	[ Ahead of them a small cyclone appears.  It is heading right for them and
  3870	reaches up to them in no time. ]
  3871	
  3872	Ranma:	What!
  3873	
  3874	[ Both Lotion and barely Ranma dodge the whirlwind.  The cyclone reverses
  3875	course and heads back toward them.  It slows down and we see it's
  3876	actually.. ]
  3877	
  3878	Voices:	We are the Golden Pair!  There is no escaping us!
  3879	
  3880	Ranma:	Mikado and Azusa... on roller skates?!
  3881	Mikado:	We meet again, Saotome Ranma.  There will be no chance for you to
  3882		run away like out last encounter.
  3883	Ranma:	Who ran away?!
  3884		Lotion, I think they may be dark-slaves, FireWater was telling us
  3885		about... 
  3886	Lotion:	Did their glowing red eyes give it away?
  3887	Ranma:	Oh yeah.  No, actually becuase he isn't trying to kiss you.
  3888		Mikado is such a playboy, normally he tries to hit on every cute
  3889		girl he sees. 
  3890	Lotion:	Hm.
  3891	
  3892	[ Mikado and Azusa attempt to ram the pair again, breaking off their
  3893	  conversation. ]
  3894	
  3895	Ranma:	Blast, they're just as fast on wheels as they are on ice!
  3896		What a bunch of cowards!  Hitting and running!
  3897		Can't you fight like a real man?  UGH!
  3898	
  3899	[ Ranma couldn't dodge their next assault ]
  3900	
  3901	Lotion:	Ranma!  Ulp!
  3902		[ Lotion started to run towards him but tripped and fell ]
  3903	Mikado:	Prepare for the end, girl!
  3904	Ranma:	Lotion!
  3905	
  3906	[ A cheesey stereotypical flash of light covers the attack preventing
  3907	  the audience from seeing the gory results ]

  3910	[ In another part of the basement of Kunou Manor ]
  3911	
  3912	Ukyou:	Look over there, Mr. Tendo!
  3913	Soun:	A circle of zombie guards around some sort of well.
  3914	Ukyou:	What's that noise?
  3915	Soun:	What noise?
  3916	Ukyou:	That wailing.
  3917	
  3918	[ A disembodied voice cuts through the room like a low whisper ]
  3919				Women.... 
  3920	
  3921	Ukyou:	It sounds like some one suffering.
  3922	Soun:	It seems to be coming from the well.
  3923	Ukyou:	I think it's calling me.
  3924	Voice:	Women.... Girls.....
  3925	Soun:	Perhaps it's a prisonor they haven't forced over to the their side
  3926		yet.
  3927	Ukyou:	I say we check it out.  After all, the guards are only zombies...
  3928	
  3929	[ The two of them manage to make short work of the half a dozen zombies ]
  3930	
  3931	Ukyou:	And that's how it is in a fair fight!
  3932	Soun:	There seems to be sort of cover over the well.
  3933	Ukyou:	And look, there's also some sort of magic seals.
  3934		Maybe it's some powerful magic that the Fang fear.
  3935	Soun:	Hmm...
  3936		Oh no!.
  3937	
  3938	[ Soun grabs Ukyou and starts to run away ]
  3939	
  3940	Ukyou:	Mr. Tendo!  What is it?  Is is some sort of demon?
  3941	Soun:	No, something worse.
  3942	Ukyou:	What could it be?
  3943	Voice:	Women... Girls... Panties...
  3944	Soun:	Happosai.

  3951	FireWater:	Be very careful to remain undetected, Dr. Tofu.
  3952		This will stretch your stealth skills to their limits..
  3953	
  3954	Purple:	Hello, Jo.
  3955	
  3956	FW:	PC!
  3957	
  3958	Purple:	It's been a long time, Jo.
  3959	FW:	Not long enough, PC.
  3960	Purple:	You know, you were my hand-picked disciple, and yet you betrayed me!
  3961		After what you did to the Boss..
  3962	FW:	Your boss got what was deserving to..
  3963	Purple:	Shutup!  Don't talk to me about grief.
  3964		Because of you, I lost my status.
  3965		Because of you, my existance was became miserable.
  3966		Becuase of you, I was assigned, that moron GreenCoat, as my partner!
  3967	FW:	You're breaking my heart.
  3968	Purple:	No, not yet, old friend, not yet.
  3969		[ PurpleCoat brings up his hands, in a flash his fingernails 
  3970		extend to claws ]
  3971	
  3972	FW:	You'll never win.
  3973	Purple:	Why, is your pathetic last minute G-force spinoff going to stop us?
  3974		Did you really think you could suprise us?
  3975	FW:	Dr. Tofu, get out of here!  It's all a trap!

  3981	Lotion:	Take that, stupid male.
  3982	Ranma:	Lotion, are you alright?!
  3983	Lotion:	Of course.  Did you think one such as I would  just trip?
  3984	
  3985	[ We see a slow re-enactment of the events.  When Lotion "tripped", the
  3986	Golden Pair closed in for the kill.  Lotion suddenly springs up with a
  3987	jump kick nailing Mikado in the jaw and sends Azusa flying off. ]
  3988	
  3989	Lotion:	Typical over-confident playboy.
  3990	Azusa:	Azusa-chan say it not over yet!
  3991	
  3992	[ The fight isn't over yet.  Azusa managed to regain her balance and circled
  3993	  back to the fight ]
  3994	
  3995	Ranma:	Lotion, look out!
  3996	
  3997	[ Lotion calmly punches Azusa's lights out as soon as she came in range ]
  3998	
  3999	Lotion:	Hmf!  Weak.
  4000	Ranma:	You *hit* her!
  4001	Lotion:	She was going to hit me.
  4002	Ranma:	Well...
  4003	Lotion:	And Lotion think she deserved it.
  4004	Ranma:	I wonder how they found us, it was almost as if they were
  4005		waiting for us to show up here...
  4006		Lotion, you should be more careful, I think..
  4007	Lotion:	I need no man's protection.
  4008	
  4009	Voice:	How sweet!
  4010	
  4011	Ranma:	What?!
  4012	
  4013	[ From above a figure wearing black evening clothes jumps down and palm
  4014	  stikes both Ranma and Lotion ]
  4015	
  4016	Lotion:	My side...!
  4017	
  4018	Ranma:	Uh!
  4019	Taihen:	My dear, with your fighting style, you must be from the
  4020		Joketsuzoku clan in China.
  4021	Lotion:	You!  The stranger!
  4022	Taihen:	At your service. [ mock bows in western style ]
  4023		I'm sure you will be happy to know, you're the last survivor.
  4024	Lotion:	What?!  You lie!  My family...
  4025	Taihen:	All dead.  We made sure.  [ smiles, shows off his fangs ]
  4026	Lotion:	I'll kill you...ARHH!  [ clutches her sides ]
  4027	Ranma:	Lotion run!  I'll hold him off! [ jump kicks Taihen ]
  4028	Lotion:	I said I need no man's...
  4029	Ranma:	Don't argue!  You'll be no help if you're dead.
  4030		And with your injuries you'll only be a liability.
  4031	
  4032	[ Lotion seems to protest, but then remembers Shampoo told her the same thing.
  4033	  She looks at Ranma and then runs off ]
  4034	
  4035	Taihen:	Not a bad kick, kid.  Want to try again?
  4036	
  4037	[ Ranma gives a punch to his jaw ]
  4038	
  4039	Taihen:	Did that hurt? [ Ranma clutches his fist ]
  4040	Ranma:	...No!
  4041	
  4042	[ Ranma delivers a fast and furious assault on Taihen.
  4043	  After a while Taihen just picks Ranma up and throws him through a wall ]
  4044	
  4045	Taihen:	Well, I had enough.  Give up?
  4046	Ranma:	No!!!
  4047	Taihen:	My, you are persistant.  Alright, let's do it again!
  4048	
  4049	[ Repeated scenes of Ranma getting his tail kicked ]
  4050	
  4051	Taihen:	You're very strong, I'll give you that.  But you're only human.
  4052		Me, I have mystically enhanced super strength and endurance.
  4053		I'm getting bored, are you sure you don't want to give up?
  4054	
  4055	Ranma:	Not over yet...
  4056	
  4057	[ Ranma slips out of Taihen's reach and starts racing towards one of
  4058	  the walls that are still standing, from his body colliding with it.
  4059	  He jumps at it and rebounds all over the chamber building up speed and
  4060	  power.  Finally he bounces off the ceiling. ] 
  4061	
  4062	Ranma:	My last chance is a kick with reflex action from the ceiling...
  4063	
  4064	[ Ranma comes straight down towards Taiehn, who is bracing himself for the
  4065	impact with a confident look on his face. ]
  4066	
  4067	Ranma:	That fool, I don't care if he is a monster.  My reflex attack has
  4068		taken out Ryouga and even Pance Taro!
  4069	
  4070	[ As Ranma touches his target, Taihen changes into a cloud of mist.
  4071	  Ranma goes right through and makes a pretty impressive crater in the floor]
  4072	
  4073	Taihen:	You're not a bad fighter.  You actually lasted 5 minutes with me in
  4074		combat.  You'll make a welcome addition to the Fang.  For what it's
  4075		worth, I think you gave your girlfriend a decent chance of getting
  4076		away. 
  4077	
  4078	Ranma:	sHE's nOT mY GiRl.... ugh... [falls unconscious ]
  4079	
  4080	Taihen:	Don't feel bad that you lost, you're only mortal.
  4081		After all, I'm NOT just a monster, I'm a VAMPIRE monster.

  4116	  large chamber filled with stone slabs.  About ten are covered with black

  4165	  of thing on his back and holding an umbrella in his hand.  The rain

  4213	The Story so Far
  4214		The resistance force has infiltrated the Fang headquarters in 
  4215	a desperate attempt to stop the Fang dominance before it was too late.
  4216	Already the Fang's power was growing to large.  However their sneak attack was
  4217	discovered and Ranma and Soun were captured.  The rest are fleeing for
  4218	their lives while FireWater encounters his old nemesis PurpleCoat...
  4219	(If you want a more detailed synopsis, read the original parts)
  4220			*		*		*
  4221	
  4222	[ We see FireWater and PurpleCoat both wrestling with one another, when
  4223	  suddenly PurpleCoat gets a sudden revelation ]
  4224	
  4225	Purple:	What, He's here, the Wanderer!
  4226	FW:	The Wandering one?!
  4227	Purple:	But that's impossible, he couldn't bypass the inhibition
  4228		mis-direction field...	UNH!
  4229	
  4230	FW:	Hate to sucker punch anyone, but we're both professional enough to
  4231		admit anyone who doesn't keep their mind on their business deserved
  4232		that.
  4233	Tofu:	Shall we go now?
  4234	FW:	Yes, I've got enough of what I was looking for.

  4237	[ Ryouga has just arrived on the scene where a vampire was about to
  4238	  attack Ukyou ]
  4239	
  4240	Ukyou:	Ryouga.
  4241	Ryouga:	I'm not here to look for any trouble, I just need some directions.
  4242		What you do after that is none of my business.
  4243	Vampire: RARRH!!
  4244	Ryouga:	Do you know the way to Tendo Dojo?
  4245	
  4246	[ In response the Vampire attacks, Ryouga easily sidesteps. ]
  4247	
  4248	Ryouga:	I have had it!  I don't need this!  Do you have any idea
  4249		how long I've been Wandering around aimlessly?!
  4250	Vampire: RARRH!!
  4251	Ukyou:	Ryouga!  It's a monster!  Kill it before it kills you!
  4252	Ryouga:	He may be a masher but that's no reason to call him a monster...
  4253	Ukyou:	You idiot!  He wasn't assaulting me, he was trying to eat me!
  4254	
  4255	[ The vampire leaps at Ryouga, in response Ryouga rams his umbrella pole
  4256	  right into the back of the vampire's head knocking it out. ]
  4257	
  4258	Ryouga:	Hmf, wasn't so tough.
  4259	Ukyou:	It must be the wooden splinters...
  4260	Ryouga:	Ukyou, do you know where Akane is?
  4261	Ukyou:	...
  4262		Don't you know what's happening?!  Don't you know what's at
  4263		stake?!  I almost got killed and all you want to know is where
  4264		Akane is... Why I...

  4270	"Captain Zen, the squadron of Gamma units are calling in", an aide prompted.
  4271	 What now?, Zen thought.  He was busy in the middle of another heated
  4272	 debate with Dr. Kno.
  4273		"Patch me in.  On-screen", Zen ordered.  On his monitor the
  4274	commander of the squad, officer Yotsuya's face popped on.  Zen didn't like
  4275	him too much.  The man was too much of a loner, no one really knew much about
  4276	him.  He never really talked about himself, no one even knew his age,
  4277	hometown or even first name.  He didn't even have his home address in their
  4278	Databanks.  Of course all that information was highly classified even to
  4279	officers, the ESPolice was a highly covert organization.  And from what he
  4280	heard about Yotsuya made him consider him as a far less than competant man.
  4281	He had a reputation to be lazy, a party animal and a pervert whose hobby was
  4282	peeping and being nosey in other people's private lives.  Luckily he wasn't
  4283	directly in his own department.
  4284	"Captain, we regret to inform you that the search turned out negative.",
  4285	Yotsuya reported.
  4286		"What?  How can that be?", Zen asked.
  4287	"When we approached the target area, we somehow kept on getting off course.
  4288	 We can't explain it.  We've never experienced anything like this before.",
  4289	the squad leader explained.
  4290		"That's ridiculous!  Have you all forgotten how to read maps?!"
  4291		Zen brushed his hair back with his hand, it was getting to be a
  4292		long day. 
  4293	"We've been trying for over an hour.  It's not working, even with computer
  4294	 guidenance.  We're running out of fuel sir and I personally really have to
  4295	 go to the bathroom.  We're heading back to base.", Yotsuya reported.
  4296		"Oh no you don't!  You have a mission to accomplish, your fellow
  4297		agents...", Zen started.
  4298	"Sorry, but we're not going to be much help if we run out of fuel and crash.
  4299	 Squad leader out.", and then the transmission was cut. 
  4300		"Well, no New Years card for him.", but Zen was still stuck in a
  4301		delimna.  He still didn't know what was happening with Aih and Kay,
  4302		and he hated that.
  4303	"I knew this was a mistake.", Dr. Kno butted in.
  4304		"Constructive critism would be a bit more helpful.", Zen said calmly.
  4305	"Well, they have a point.  Something very screwy is going on in that town.
  4306	 Do you think you can do a better job?", Dr. Kno challenged.
  4307		"Why do you think I'm so worried?!  And YES, I think I could do a
  4308		better job.  In fact, I think I will!", Zen exclaimed.
  4309	"Are you crazy?", Dr. Kno retorted.
  4310		"No, enlightened.  Get a Gamma unit ready for me."
  4311	"The fuel consumption of a Gamma unit won't last you more than a...", Dr.
  4312	Kno started to argue. 
  4313		"You're absolutely right.  Belay that order and prepare the Delta
  4314		unit for me."
  4315	"That's the only working prototype!  If anything happens to it.."
  4316		"Don't worry Doctor.  I'll take good care of it.  I need the
  4317		Delta's solar power cells.  If the reports are right, I'm going to
  4318		need the most efficient power system.", Zen  pointed out.
  4319	"But weather reports say there is an unexpected storm brewing in the
  4320	area...", Dr. Kno started dumping the pilesof reports on Zen.
  4321		"Doctor.  I'm getting one of my feelings on this.  I have to go with
  4322		it.  The batteries are always charged up and by the time they run
  4323		out the storm will have blown over.  Now if you excuse me I have
  4324		meetings to cancel and my flight suit to prepare."
  4325	"I think it's a mistake.", Dr. Kno said to himself as he left his office.

  4329	[ Ranma awakes to find himself... ]
  4330	
  4331	Ranma:	Chained?!  Where am I?
  4332	
  4333	[ He looks around, he seems to be in some sort of dungeon. ]
  4334	
  4335	Ranma:	I never knew Kunou had weird places like this in his mansion.
  4336	
  4337	[ He sees that he's not alone.  Another person is chained on the opposite
  4338	  wall with him. ]
  4339	
  4340	Ranma:	Mr. Tendo!
  4341	Soun:	Oh hello, Ranma.  I see they caught you too.
  4342	Ranma:	Well it wasn't my fault, I was covering Lotion's escape.
  4343	Soun:	The same with me.
  4344	
  4345	Green:	What a bunch of wimps.  Why can't you both just admit that you were
  4346		out classed and  got trounced?
  4347	
  4348	Ranma:	Where did you come from?!
  4349	Green:	Magic.
  4350	Ranma:	If I weren't in chains...
  4351	Green:	Anytime, boy.
  4352	Ranma:	Don't call me, boy!
  4353	
  4354	Taihen:	Green, get yourself to the meeting.  We're all waiting for you.
  4355	
  4356	Green:	Taihen!  Where did you come from?!
  4357	
  4358	Taihen:	Magic.  Now c'mon.  It seems to be pretty important.
  4359		Purple's raving about the Wandering one.
  4360	
  4361	Soun:	The Wanderer?

  4363	
  4364		In a familiar police station in the secrurity division, 
  4365	"I tell you he gives me the creeps.", the rookie on duty was telling his
  4366	shift partner.
  4367		"That guy suspected of murder?", his partner replied.
  4368	"Yeah, he's still there, sitting still as a statue, never says a word,
  4369	 never accepts food or water..", the rookie explained.
  4370		"Well, he's been like that ever since they brough him in.  But don't
  4371		worry.  He can't keep it up forever.  The Captain's getting
  4372		anxious, and one way or another the Captain is gonna get his
  4373		answers.", his partner assured. 
  4374	
  4375		Which might might or might not be true.  In any case, sitting in the
  4376	cell, was a not of a madman with iron will but rather just a person on the
  4377	verge of breaking.  It has been days since the prisoner has moved, spoken,
  4378	eaten or even bathed.  The prisoner would do anything to just end the
  4379	torment.  For beneath the figure's long jagged blue cloak and fearsome
  4380	metallic faceplate was just a vulnerable young woman.  A young redhaired
  4381	woman in a police uniform.  A young woman who has been gagged, tied, and
  4382	had this ridiculous costume draped over her.  She tried contacting the
  4383	guard on duty of her predictiment, but all she could get out were some
  4384	jiggles and groans.  The rookie on duty would just stare  at her and then
  4385	run off.  What the heck was taking them so long?  Why didn't they just come
  4386	in and rip off the disguise and see that they had the wrong person!  Why
  4387	was the police force always so incompetent?! 
  4388	
  4389		"I tell you, the way he moves and makes those sounds.  Do you think
  4390		he could be some weirdo engaged in a trance?"
  4391	"I dunno, he just gives me the creeps.", the rookie replied.	
  4392	 	"Let's get out of here..."
  4393	"Yeah, I'm with you.", and the two rookies run off to make their other rounds.

  4395	[ At the ruins of Utchan ]
  4396	
  4397	FireWater:	Where are the others?!
  4398	Tofu:	Calm down, they may have just have been delayed.
  4399	FW:	I don't think so.  The Fang were expecting us, I guess Purple's
  4400		mental disciplines has been improving more than I thought.
  4401	Tofu:	Did you find out what you wanted to know?
  4402	FW:	Partly, we're in worse trouble than I thought.
  4403		If we don't get more fighting power we may never be able to
  4404		free this city from Fang's influence.  And if the city falls...
  4405	Tofu:	That person, what was his name..?
  4406	FW:	PC?  Well, PurpleCoat was never the one to give up a grudge...
  4407	Tofu:	Yes, he said he knew you...
  4408	FW:	That was a long time ago..
  4409	Tofu:	What exactly..
  4410	
  4411	Lotion:	Please forgive this one for being late.
  4412		[ Enger Lotion covered in blood and clutching her side ]
  4413	
  4414	Tofu:	Lotion-chan, you've been hurt!
  4415	Lotion:	Not to worry, this not my blood, it theirs.
  4416	FW:	Where have you been?
  4417	Lotion:	Some zombies still patrol in shadows, but they, taken care of.
  4418		Big fight but big victory.
  4419		Many apologies for lateness but this still new city for Lo-shin.
  4420	Tofu:	I guess this is all still a little new for you.
  4421		You've barely been in the city for a couple of days.
  4422	Lotion:	Yes, Lo-shin live in home village all live.
  4423		Amazing concept this thing called street sign.
  4424	FW:	Where's the others?
  4425	Lotion:	Ranma did not make it, he stayed behind to cover my escape...
  4426	Tofu:	Hold still, Lotion-chan, you've aggravated your rib injury..
  4427		Hmm...
  4428	
  4429	Tofu:	We have to talk! [ grabbing FireWater aside ]
  4430	FireWater: Dr. Tofu?
  4431	Tofu:	What's going on?  That zombie blood is exactly the same as
  4432		human blood! 
  4433	FW:	Oh, is that all?  That's because it is.  Despite being mindless
  4434		slaves, the Zombies are still human.
  4435	Tofu:	But then they may still be abled to be saved.
  4436		We can't hurt them too badly!  We might kill them!
  4437	FW:	Don't you think I know that?!  I've fought the Fang before, they do
  4438		the same tricks, turning your friends and family into their shock
  4439		troopers.  I wrestled with the same dilemna.  If we tell the others
  4440		that the zombies are still their friends, they'll go easy on them.
  4441	Tofu:	But can't we cure them or release them from their control?
  4442	FW:	Once their blood has been linked, it is nearly impossible.
  4443	Tofu:	But still...
  4444	FW:	This isn't a rpg adventure!  We can't afford to hold back with
  4445		these stakes.  Remember what happened the last time Ranma took it
  4446		easy with an attacking zombie horde?  He nearly got killed.
  4447	Tofu:	I don't like this...
  4448	FW:	I'll take responsibilities for any lives lost.
  4449		Their deaths will be on my hands.
  4450	Tofu:	There's got to be another way....
  4451	
  4452	Ryouga:	Excuse me, do you know the way to the Tofu clinic?
  4453		I have a patient here..
  4454

  4456	  with the top of  her blouse  ripped open, exposing her neck ]
  4457	
  4458	FW:	Vamp..ire! [ staring at Ryouga's fangs ]
  4459	Ryouga:	Huh?
  4460	
  4461	[ In one fluid spring motion, FireWater leaps up to Ryouga, grabs his neck
  4462	  and flings him on top of one of the not-broken tables.  With a flick of
  4463	  his free hand, a stake slides from out of his sleeve ]
  4464	
  4465	FW:	Die, you monster!
  4466	Ryouga:	What..!
  4467	Tofu:	Stop!  He's not a vampire.
  4468	
  4469	[ Tofu-sensei grabbed his hand before FireWater impaled Ryouga with the stake ]
  4470	
  4471	FW:	What?
  4472	Tofu:	I said he's not a vampire, he just needs some dental work.
  4473	Ryouga:	....
  4474	FW:	[ himself ] Amazing, he actually stopped my hand.

  4479	[ At Kunou Manor ]
  4480	Purple:	I'm telling you, the Wandering one is here!
  4481		I felt his presence!
  4482	Commander: Just like you sensed the renegade.
  4483	Taihen:	But the latest Intelligence reports say the Wanderer was heading
  4484		away from this town and the renegade is still incarcerated in a jail
  4485		cell.. 
  4486	Purple:	Well I'll tell that to FireWater the next time we're engaed in nmortal
  4487		combat together.
  4488	Green:	Yeah, and Intelligence has been know to be, well, wrong.
  4489	
  4490	[ At the store Utchan ]
  4491	Ukyou:	Thank you Tofu-sensei, I wouldn't know what to do without you.
  4492	Tofu:	Just get your rest Ukyou.
  4493	Ukyou:	Where's Ryouga?  I wanted to thank him for saving me and I also
  4494		wanted to apologize for..
  4495	Tofu:	Mr. FireWater sent him out as a scout.  He decided that Ryouga
  4496		would be the least conspicuous among us.
  4497	FireWater: What I'm curinous is how he bypassed the misdirection field
  4498		surrounding the city.
  4499	Ukyou:	Ryouga said he was just walking around aimlessly.  He gave up
  4500		and was heading home when he bumped into me.
  4501	FW:	That boy must have incredible luck..
  4502	Ukyou:	Well, not really...
  4503	Tofu:	Mr. FireWater, what was it you said before, about the Wandering one?
  4504		I thought he was just a myth.
  4505	
  4506	[ In a dungeon at Kunou Manor ]
  4507	Ranma:	So just exactly who is this Wanderer?
  4508	Soun:	Well...
  4509	
  4510	[ Kunou manor ]
  4511	Green:  Is he like the Wandering kid?
  4512	Purple:	FOOL!  This is a PG rated series!
  4513	
  4514	[ Utchan ]
  4515	FireWater: No, more like the Wandering Jew, except he's not jewish.
  4516	Tofu:	"He will not taste death until his work in the world is finished."
  4517	Ukyou:	Aren't you the Wanderer, Mr. FireWater?
  4518	
  4519	[ Kunou Dungeon ]
  4520	
  4521	Soun:
  4522	Ledgends say he's a holy man, a saint but also a hermit.
  4523	It is said that he was a pivotal player in one of the ancient
  4524	holy wars.  He was offered solace with the Gods in paradise
  4525	but he turned it down to serve on earth.
  4526	His duty is to defend the weak against the overwhelming forces of evil.
  4527	-=-
  4528	
  4529	PurpleCoat:
  4530	But the Gods were upset at such a refusal, it was an insult to them!
  4531	So they cursed him to walk the earth preforming his duty.
  4532	They also warned him that they would never come to his aid when he needed
  4533	them and that even in death, paradise would be denied him forever.
  4534	So he is doomed to wander the earth until the end of the world.
  4535	But ledgends also say, that's the way he likes it.
  4536	
  4537	
  4538	Commander:
  4539	He is said to have awesome powers.  They say he could split the
  4540	very earth, sky and stars.  His exploits have carried him into far
  4541	lands and netherworlds.  Stories say he has done everything from repelling
  4542	alien invasions to time travelling to overthrowing conquerors.  It is
  4543	rumored that he reincarnates himself to remain strong and powerful.  In
  4544	his new incarnation he has a new life until his conscioussness awakens.
  4545	That might explain why he is seen so rarely and even disappears completely
  4546	for years at a time.  The last alledged siting was about 20 years ago.
  4547	But of couse this all ledgends.

  4549	
  4550	FireWater:
  4551	Oh, he does exist, but I'm not him.  But I did meet him a very long time
  4552	ago, in fact he's the that my life.  I offered to be his disciple but he
  4553	told me he had no wish and no need of one.  He warned me that no one wanted
  4554	to lead a life like life.  But he also told me that I would be forced to
  4555	walk another path, very similar to his own.  He was right.  I think we've
  4556	even crossed again once or twice but I don't think he remembered me.  He
  4557	probably had bigger things on his mind. 
  4558	-=-
  4559

  4582	Ranma:	What?  Never!
  4583	Green:	Yeah, they all say that.
  4584		Do you know what it really means to be a Dark-slave?

  4589	Green:	Quiet, old man, I wasn't talking to you.  Now where was I?  Oh yeah.
  4590		It's not what you think, it has nothing to do with sucking your
  4591		blood out.  We use good old fashioned reliable BRAIN-WASHING. 
  4592	Ranma:	Brain-washing?
  4593	Green:	You see, BOY, you're still pretty naive.
  4594		Not like me at all, I'm over 150 years old.
  4595		You see everyone has a Dark half.
  4596	Ranma:	Dark half?
  4597	
  4598	Green:	The part of them that they always supress.
  4599	 	The really bad part of you.  Where your id and ego collide.
  4600		The trick is to subjugate person towards this evil inclination.
  4601		Once a person confronts and destroys what they hate and love the most,
  4602		they are eternally lost to their dark side.  Afterwards the
  4603		victim usually hates herself so much, they willingly follow the
  4604		Fang in a feeble attempt at self-punishment and as a chance to
  4605		release all their vent up frustrations on innocent victims.  
  4606	
  4607	Ranma:	Why do you do this?
  4608	Green:	Well, this way, the person is still basically the same, they can
  4609		still utilize all their talents and abilities.  And after a while
  4610		they start to like it and then ASK to fully join the Fang.  
  4611	Ranma:	That's crazy!
  4612	Green:	Yeah, we all felt the same way too.
  4613	Ranma:	...
  4614		No!  I'll fight you.  I won't lose!

  4727		"Any luck?", Kay asked Aih who was fiddling with the transmitter.
  4728	"No.  Local communications between us seem fine but I can't get in contact
  4729	 with headquarters.", Aih responded.
  4730		"Are you sure?", Kay inquired.
  4731	"I've been trying for two days.  I think we should assume the worst that
  4732	we've been discovered and our transmissions are being jammed.  In that case
  4733	we better get our equiptment ready in case we're attacked.  I'm tired of
  4734	just waiting around.  Too many strange things are happening.  It's high
  4735	time we started a more explicit investigation.", Aih said as she got her
  4736	gear together.  
  4737		"Yes Aih-san!", Kay quickly responded.
  4738	
  4739		As he was unpacking his equiptment, Kay stated thinking about the
  4740	old times.  Everything seemed so much simpler then.  Sometimes he just
  4741	wished he could go back to that day.  But instead he got "drafted" for this
  4742	government job.  His mind started drifting back to the day when he was
  4743	discovered.  Oh sure they first promised him great power, status and money.
  4744	But he wasn't really interested in those things, he was always just a
  4745	simple guy.  He only wanted life's simple pleasures, the company of his
  4746	friends and family.  But when they suggested that they might start
  4747	recruiting the rest of his family if he didn't cooperate, he knew he was
  4748	caught.  It was also better than being an outcast, blacklisted by the
  4749	government.  Luckily they also wanted to enlist Aih-san and Whai-kun since
  4750	they felt they had what it took to make it on the team.  Otherwise he would
  4751	have been all by himself with a group of strangers.  If he was going to go
  4752	on these hazardous missions, he wanted to be surrounded by people he trusted. 
  4753	
  4754		He would follow Aih-san to the ends of the world and back just to
  4755	be with her.  And Whai-kun, although the two of them didn't really get
  4756	along, they did know each other for a long time.  And if push came to
  4757	shove, he knew Whai-kun would risk his life for him, or so he hoped.
  4758	Luckily They never ran into such a situation in their short mission
  4759	history.  One thing about Whai-kun was he could handle himself in a fight.
  4760	And in a situation and place like this, having such a backup would really
  4761	help calm his nerves more than 10 bottles of Pepto-Bismol.
  4762	
  4763		While he was putting on his armor, he was just amazed how beautiful
  4764	Aih-san always looked.  No matter what the time, condtion or weather, she
  4765	was always a shining star.  She always looked good no matter what she was
  4766	wearing.  In fact, it was amazing how cute she looked, even in battle gear.
  4767		"Kay-kun", she suddenly said.
  4768	"Aih-san...", he responded.
  4769		"Why are you Kay-kun?"
  4770	"What...?", Kay could not believe what he heard.
  4771		"I said: why are you just standing there, Kay-kun?", she said more
  4772		firmly breaking his imagination. 
  4773	"Uh..uh.."
  4774		"Stop fooling around.", she chastised and zipped up her jacket.
  4775	"Sorry", Kay glumly apologized and got to his own gear.  He berrated
  4776	himself for thinking so inappropriated during a mission.  If he wasn't
  4777	careful, his inability to concentrate on the things at hand might 
  4778	end up getting himself, or worse, Aih-san, killed. 
  4779		"Let's go.  We're going to take this place by storm and find out
  4780		exactly what's going on", Aih vowed.
  4781	And outside, the thunderstorm was breaking.

  4826	
  4827	Voice:	The test is, can you kill your father, before he kills you?	
  4828	
  4829	Ranma:	What?  You want me to kill him?  We may not have gotten along
  4830		as the best father and son but...
  4831		Hey!  There's no reason to get violent!
  4832		ARRHA!  My face...  You cut me..
  4833	
  4834	[ The Panda just clawed Ranma's face.  Bright red blood flows evenly
  4835	  from three cuts across his cheek. ]
  4836	
  4837	Ranma:	I'm bleeding...
  4838	
  4839	[ The Panda roars and charges him, clawing and biting ]

  4841	Ranma:	Get off me!  I'm trying to help you!
  4842		ARRHA!
  4843	
  4844	[ The Panda just bit him across the shoulder, Ranma gets a crazed look
  4845	  on his face ]
  4846	
  4847	Ranma:	I'm tired of being easy on you!  You stinkin A-hole! 
  4848		I'll kill you!  I'll kill you!

  4854	Green:	The drugs are working fine.  He's a really crazy killing machine
  4855		all right.  It's in his blood.
  4856	
  4857	[ Back in the arena, Ranma is covered in the Panda's blood.  The still form
  4858	of the Panda is an artistic color mix of Red, White and Black.  But Ranma
  4859	isn't satisfied, he's still plummenting at the lifeless form through his
  4860	bruised knuckles and distored vision. ]
  4861	
  4862	Ranma:	It's all your fault!  It's all your fault!  I hate you!  I hate you...
  4863		...
  4864	
  4865	[ Suddenly Ranma stops and just stands there, staring at the unmoving form.
  4866	  After several minutes he stops and looks at his bloody fists.  Then he
  4867	  looks back at the still body of his father.  Suddenly it isn't a Panda
  4868	  he sees before him, but the broken body of the man he calls his father.
  4869	  He no longer sees the panda who tried to kill him, nor the man he always
  4870	  hated, nor even the man who gave him such a miserable life.  He only sees
  4871	  the dead form of a man who loved him as a child, took care of him when he
  4872	  was sick and kept him warm when he was cold. ] 
  4873

  4897		since he is an expert at hiding his presence it's proving to be
  4898		very difficult.  It might take hours of constant mediataion.

  4901	Purple:	Such as what?  I am one of the best trackers in the Fang.
  4902	Nabiki:	Why don't you just interrogate the prisoners?
  4903		They might have an idea where they are.

  4978		Fang Warriors - Sanjuu!
  4979	Purple:	What?
  4980	Green:	Hmm, maybe we should use another Battle Cry like..
  4981		Fang Warriors Assemble!
  4982	Purple:	Green, shutup.  Alright, everyone... ikimasu!
  4983	Green:	...
  4984	
  4985	[ inside ]
  4986	Ukyou:	Look!  Ran-chan is with them!
  4987	FW:	BLAST!  I thought they could hold out longer than this.
  4988		We should have relocated sooner, but I kept hoping that somehow
  4989		they would manage to escape.
  4990	Ryouga:	What's going on?
  4991	FW:	Ranma is serving the Fang now as a Dark-slave.
  4992	All:	WHAT?!
  4993	
  4994	[ outside the top three Fang fighters and Ranma, who is wearing dark shades,
  4995	  are preparing to attack again ]
  4996	
  4997	Purple:	Again.
  4998	Ranma:	Lion's Roaring Bullet!
  4999		[ He unleashes an energy blast which punches another hole in the wall]
  5000	
  5001	Purple:	Under our tutelage, he's fully mastered the technique.
  5002		Becoming a dark-slave has given him the mental discipline he needed.
  5003		He no longer needs to be fuelled by emotion.
  5004	
  5005	Green:	Give up!
  5006	
  5007	[ inside, everyone is in shock at Ranma's new allegience.  Ukyou is
  5008	  crying on her knees ]
  5009	
  5010	FW:	I'll hold them off.  The rest of you get out of here!
  5011		Ukyou, get a grip on yourself!  Don't make me...
  5012	Ukyou:	I can't help it!  I got  a piece of onion in my eye.
  5013	Tofu:	They're whittling down our numbers one by one.
  5014		We have to think of something else.	
  5015	FW:	All their major players have come out for this one,
  5016		Ukyou and Lotion are still recovering from injuries.
  5017		We don't have a chance otherwise, now go!
  5018	
  5019	[ Outside ]
  5020	 
  5021	Purple:	If they don't start coming out, we'll send in the slave to flush
  5022		them out.  Most of their defenses will be useless against a 
  5023		non-vampire.
  5024	Green:	Look!
  5025	
  5026	[ The whole store is suddenly engulfed in smoke, form a point the figure
  5027	  of a man slowly forms... ]
  5028		I am the Terror that Guards in the night..
  5029		I am the Bell curve which gives you an F...
  5030		I am FIREWATER!
  5031	Green:	...that causes stomach acid.
  5032		And they say *I* watch too much TV.
  5033	Taihen:	He always did have a flair for the dramatic.
  5034	FW:	I am your opponent.  You must defeat me before passing.
  5035	
  5036	Green:	How are you going to stop us?  Your Spinning Dragon technique won't
  5037		work against us, being a vampire makes us as cool as a corpse.
  5038	
  5039	FW:	[thinking ] I don't want to do this, but I have no choice..
  5040		[ outloud ] Heh, your little bullet technique doesn't impress me.
  5041		Here is one personally taught to me by the master.
  5042		[ concentrates ] Mmmmmmm..
  5043	
  5044	Taihen:	What in..
  5045	Purple:	That power signature...
  5046	
  5047	[ As FireWater concentrates, a blue aura surrounds him.  The light
  5048	  gets more brigher and more powerful ]
  5049	
  5050	FW:	WINGED GRIFFIN POUNCE!
  5051	
  5052	[ His light expands and engulfs him completely.  The light takes on the form
  5053	  of a giant Griffin with it's wings unfolding.  FireWater thrusts out
  5054	  his arm towards the Fang warriors, likewise the Griffin image leaps at them.
  5055	  The resulting impact blows all of them down through the pavement ]
  5056	
  5057	Purple:	That... hurt... real bad...
  5058	Taihen:	Okay....
  5059	Green:	I'd like to see you do that again...
  5060	
  5061	FW:	Winged Griffin Pounce!
  5062	
  5063	[ Again they are all hurled away ]
  5064	
  5065	Taihen:	You and your big mouth!
  5066	Green:	He can't keep it up..
  5067	
  5068	[ This time FireWater throws both arms in the air in his next attack.
  5069	  The results are still the same ]
  5070	
  5071	Taihen:	Uhhh, that didn't hurt *too* bad...
  5072	Green:	He must be tiring...
  5073	Purple:	How much do you want to bet we'll break before he does?
  5074	Ranma:	Why don't we attack him while he's powering up instead of
  5075		waiting for him to finish.
  5076	
  5077	[ All three of them just look blankly ]
  5078	
  5079	Purple:	All together now...
  5080	ALL:	Lion's Roaring Bullet!!!
  5081	FW:	Winged... uhhh!
  5082	
  5083	[ This time FireWater is the one blown through the ground ]
  5084	
  5085	Purple:	HA!  That knocked the wind out of his sails!
  5086	Green:	Yeah, and it only took four of us to do it!
  5087	Taihen:	Oohh, my back feels like it's broken.
  5088	Purple:	Where are the others?
  5089	Ranma:	They escaped.
  5090	Purple:	It doesn't matter, there is no one coming to help them.
  5091		They can run, but this city is already ours.
  5092		It's only a matter of time before everyone joins us.
  5093	
  5094			*		*		*
  5095	[ In the city four people are running around aimlessly ]
  5096	Tofu:	Hurry!  They might be following us.
  5097		Just keep running straight ahead.
  5098	Ukyou:	Tofu-sensei, what we going to do?
  5099	Ryouga:	Straight ahead?

  5118	Sorry this took so long, but I was really busy with real work and
  5119	doing the Saint Seiya! fanfiction.
  5120	
  5121	For all those of you who have been requesting previous parts, I will try
  5122	and deliver.  But I believe there should be ftp sites floating around
  5123	with copies.  Please don't email me and ask for everything I've written.
  5124	I don't have time to respond to every one, wouldn't you rather have me
  5125	waste time writing these fanfictions? :-)
  5126	
  5127	The story is now about HALF done :-)

  5138					EPISODE VII
  5139					A New Hope				
  5140	
  5141					The Fang Empire		
  5142				has struck a vital blow to the
  5143				Resistance.  Their new found base	
  5144			was attacked and overwhelmed.  Their most	
  5145			important ally in the fight, FireWater, was
  5146			captured covering the escape of the other Resistance	
  5147		forces.  Many brave fighters have already fallen to The Dark Side
  5148		of their minds.  Their newest recruit, Ranma has gladly joined
  5149		their ranks as did Nabiki in exchange for material wealth and power.
  5150		Things look bleak for the heroes, with an army of Fang troopers free
  5151	to stalk the city at all times and a magical misdirection field	prevents any
  5152	aid from any outside allies.  Hope lies only in the mysterious ESP Knights
  5153	of justice if only they can act in time...

  5158	[ In a prison cell, a captured prisoner awakens into darkness ]
  5159	
  5160	FireWater: Uhh, where am I?
  5161	
  5162	Female Voice:	You've been transported to a prison cell.
  5163	
  5164	FireWater: Can't see, why can't I see?!
  5165	
  5166	Voice:	Calm down, you've been put into freeze storage.
  5167		That's the reason for your vision impairment.
  5168		Your eyesight should be returning shortly.
  5169	
  5170	FireWater: Who are you?
  5171	
  5172	Voice:	...A friend.  They'll be coming for you shortly.
  5173		I..I..  have to go.
  5174	
  5175	FireWater: Wait!  I don't even know your...
  5176		Blast.  Who was she...
  5177	
  5178	[ FireWater closes his eyes and remembers the sweet scent of her
  5179	  perfume and honey-like voice.  He can almost picture her in his mind.
  5180	  Was he dreaming?  At last he forces open his eyes and is greeted to... ]
  5181	
  5182	Male voice:	Good evening, I see you're finally awake.
  5183	
  5184	[ .. a rather homely looking young man wearing some sort of gray uniform.
  5185	  FireWater looks around his dark prison cell, along the opposite wall is
  5186	  Soun likewise chained up.  Likewise, so is he. ]
  5187	
  5188	FireWater:	Talk about a rude awakening.
  5189	
  5190	Gosunkugi: I trust your trip here wasn't too unpleasant.
  5191	FW:	Who are you, kid?	
  5192	Gosunkugi: I am Gosunkugi, you are a prisoner of the Fang.
  5193	
  5194	FW:	Aren't you a little short to be a Fang Trooper?
  5195	
  5196	Gos:	[ bares his fangs ]
  5197		As you can see, I honorably serve the empire.
  5198	FW:	You barely even taken over a dozen cities and you're already
  5199		calling yourselves an empire?
  5200		You guys were always a bit egotistical. 
  5201	Gos:	If you wish to be unpleasant, that can be arranged.
  5202		LIGHTS!
  5203	
  5204	[ Immediately the dark damp cell room is flooded with strobes ]
  5205	
  5206	FW:	OUCH, MY EYES!  Why you little sadistic...
  5207	
  5208	Gos:	As our prisoner, I must warn you: If you must continue in your
  5209		uncivilized manner, expect an equally adverse response.
  5210		I wouldn't not advise you to attempt escape, your bonds	were
  5211		specifically designed to hold you
  5212		They are too strong for even you to break.
  5213	
  5214	FW:	Ugh!
  5215	Gos:	And no doubt you have noticed the magical sanskrit seal on your chest
  5216		which will prevent you from utilizing your supernatural powers.  
  5217	
  5218	FW:	Kid, lose the stupid English accent.  It just doesn't work on you.
  5219		OOF! [ gets gut punched ].
  5220		That's pretty low, hitting a guy that's tied down.
  5221	Gos:	As the officer in charge of your incarceration, I will advise you
  5222		to address me in a respectable manner.  "Sir", "Gosunkugi-san"
  5223		and even "Fang Officer" will be acceptable. 
  5224		However "kid" is nowhere on the list.+
  5225	FW:	I'm trembling in my grave.
  5226	Gos:	Mock me if you will, but the Empire is unstoppable.
  5227		We will crush the Resistance forces. [exits ]
  5228	FW:	Hey!  How about turning off the lights!
  5229		Jerk.
  5230		Well, what else can go wrong?
  5231	
  5232	[ Immediately the cell is filled with loud military marching music,
  5233	  amplified and pumped up as high as the stereo system will allow ]
  5234	
  5235	FW:	Damn cliches.  Arh, my eardrums are going to burst.
  5236	
  5237	Soun:	Huh?!  Is it morning all ready?
  5238	
  5239	[ Outside the cell, Gosunkugi is proudly walking down the hall.  Near the
  5240	  cell block, a lone figure is hiding behind a corner ]
  5241	
  5242			*		*		*
  5243	[ At the Resistance outpost ]
  5244	
  5245	Ryouga:	This is our base?!
  5246	Ukyou:	At least we're not in the arctic where it's freezing and snowing.
  5247	Tofu:	This was the cheapest place we could rent.  We don't dare go
  5248		anywhere else in case they track us.
  5249	Ukyou:	We tried going to Shampoo's restaurant as Lotion suggested
  5250		but it was already swarming with zombies, and maybe one or two 
  5251		vampires.
  5252	Ryouga:	We're in a power struggle that might change the order of the
  5253		country and we're staying at a room in the Hothiday Inn?!
  5254		[ ed note: Yes, Hoth-iday Inn ]
  5255	Ukyou:	Well, what do you want us to do?  Start a panic?
  5256	Tofu:	It's not even that.  All the people are aware of are some strange
  5257		occurances and unusual wheather.  We don't even know how much the
  5258		Fang has even infiltrated in the city.  For all we know the
  5259		innkeeper could be a Fang Trooper.  And if what Mr. FireWater said
  5260		was true, no one can come in or out of the city until the Fang is
  5261		dealt with.
  5262	
  5263	Ukyou:	Poor Ran-chan...
  5264	Tofu:	Listen, Ranma is no more.  That.. thing out there isn't Ranma
  5265		anymore.  It's only his Dark Half.
  5266	Ryouga:	I've never seen Ranma so powerful.
  5267	Tofu:	One of the more unfortunate benefits for submitting to his Dark side.
  5268		He no longer has any reservations about seriously hurting someone.
  5269		Don't expect him to pull his punches like your previous fights.
  5270	Ryouga:	"Pull his punches"?
  5271	Tofu:	Being on the "good side" means we must be more merciful, more
  5272		careful not to do excess harm...
  5273	Lo-shin: So this, Dark side, is stronger then.
  5274	Tofu:	...No...  But it is more quicker, easier, more seductive.
  5275		That's why so many have already fallen to it, willingly even.
  5276	Lo-shin: Then hope, we have none.
  5277	Tofu:	No, don't ever think that.
  5278		We have the Force, of justice and right!
  5279	Ukyou: But they have a lot more might.
  5280

  5282	[ In a different prison block at Kunou Manor, Akane is getting restless
  5283	  just waiting to be rescued ]
  5284	
  5285	Akane:	[ waking up ] uhh, I'm still here.  What?!  Where's sister?
  5286		She's not here!  That's it, I'm not waiting for someone to rescue
  5287		me, I'm getting out now.
  5288		UHHH! [ tries to break free ]
  5289		Still too weak to free myself..
  5290	
  5291	Kasumi:	Akane, do you want to get out?
  5292		[ Kasumi appears next to her ]
  5293	Akane:	Sister?!  How..?!
  5294	Kasumi:	You were struggling so hard I was getting worried.
  5295		So I picked the locks with one of my hairpins and decided to check
  5296		up on you.
  5297	Akane:	Where did you learn to pick locks?!
  5298	Kasumi:	Well, Father always used to lock himself in the bathroom.
  5299		It was up to me to get him out.  I've gotten fairly proficient at it.
  5300	Akane:	Well, get me out of here and I'll see if I can break the door open.
  5301	Kasumi:	Oh, I already opened it.  It just gets so stuffy down here in
  5302		this dungeon.  They really ought to clean it.
  5303		I've been looking for cleaning agents outside.
  5304			*		*		*
  5305	
  5306		 In the main conference room of the Fang, the Strike Commander is
  5307	sitting on his chair, which just happens to be fairly large, luxurious and
  5308	more slightly elevated compared to the other chairs in the room.  He is
  5309	also wearing his customary black robes but unusually he is also wearing his
  5310	black lusterous war helmet as well.  At the far end of the hall, a large
  5311	pair of elaborate double doors open.  Coming through is the form a young
  5312	man dressed rather smartly in a spit and polish leather uniform which marks
  5313	him as an officer.  As he approaches the Commander, the only sound to
  5314	disturb the chamber is the soft clicking of the young man's shoes and the
  5315	harsh breathing coming the Commander's chair.  The Commander, sensing the
  5316	approaching person does not even bother to turn his chair to face him.  The
  5317	young man steps in front of him and performs a stiff formal military bow. 
  5318	
  5319	Commander: Huhhhh, huhhh.
  5320		Report.
  5321	Gosunkugi:	Yes, mlord.  The prisoner has been fully secured.
  5322	Commander: And the other Resistors?
  5323	Gos:	We are trying our best to locate them.
  5324	Commander: I will not accept failure, is that understood?
  5325	Gos:	Yes, mlord. [ starts to leave ]
  5326	Commander: Gosunkugi, one last thing.
  5327		Tell someone to open some windows in here, it's 
  5328		so stuffy I can't get a decent breath of air in here.
  5329		Huhhh, huhhh cough cough!
  5330	Gos:	As you command. [ exits ]
  5331	
  5332	Green:	Mlord?!
  5333	
  5334	[ GreenCoat and PurpleCoat just popped in ]
  5335	
  5336	Purple:	He was always a weird one.  I'm not sure it was so wise to put him
  5337		in such a high position so soon.
  5338	Green:	But he has a good record of being a loyal servant!
  5339	
  5340	Purple:	You mean loyal slave.  He really didn't have much choice.
  5341		I'm not sure he's so stable.  He's an unusual case, an early bloomer,
  5342		he awakened after only 1 day.  Very strange...
  5343	Green:	There's plenty more where he came from.. Burp!
  5344	Commander:	ENOUGH!
  5345		What is the state of the Dark Slaves?
  5346	
  5347	Purple:	They are all preforming optimally.
  5348		The only injured ones, the Golden Pair, suffered remarkable injuries
  5349		from their encounter with Saotome Ranma.  Whoever can make such 
  5350		expert attacks on them must truly be a master.
  5351	
  5352	Commander: Are they being treated?
  5353	
  5354	Purple:	Yes, they are currently in the healing tanks.
  5355		Full recovery should be done by tonight.
  5356	
  5357	Commander: What about Kuonji Ukyou?  Has she stabalized?
  5358	Purple:	Barely, Commander.
  5359	Commander: I think I shall visit the tanks later tonight.
  5360		How is everything else?
  5361	Purple:	Our agent, Nabiki has been very helpful in defense plans.
  5362		Although she demands very expensive payment.
  5363	Green:	Big deal, we can steal it.
  5364	Purple:	The spellcaster was exhausted by the constant spells but she
  5365		should be fully rested by morning.
  5366	Commander: What about the vampires?  Have they awakened yet?
  5367	Green:	Their number is growing nightly.
  5368	Commander: Let about half a dozen run free on the city.
  5369		It's time to expand the empire and let our prescence known.
  5370	
  5371			*		*		*
  5372	
  5373	Ryouga: There has to be some way to boost our fighting power.
  5374	Ukyou:	That reminds me...
  5375		before Mr. Tendo was captured he said to mention.. Happosai!
  5376	Lo-shin: What's a Happosai?
  5377	Ryouga:	One of the most disgusting hentai creatures in the world.
  5378	Lo-shin: What's a hentai?
  5379	Ukyou:	He's sort of a super powerful martial artist pervert.
  5380	Ryouga:	In that order.
  5381	Lo-shin: Perhaps he ally us to fight Fang?
  5382	Ryouga:	I don't think so.
  5383	Ukyou:	Well, he was their prisoner.  Maybe he'll want to help for revenge.
  5384	Ryouga:	Most likely he'll run off and go on a panty raid.
  5385	Tofu:	Unfortunately that may be our only option.  We need his power.  
  5386		The four of us can't take on the entire city.
  5387	Ukyou:	Tofu-sensei is right.  We have take in the consideration that
  5388		anyone we meet might already been converted to their side.
  5389		But I have an idea.
  5390	Ryouga:	Wait, what about Akane?!  What happened to her?
  5391	Ukyou:	...
  5392	Tofu:	I told her to go out of town before this whole thing started.
  5393		She should be fine...
  5394	Ryouga:	...
  5395	Tofu:	Let's hear your idea.
  5396	Ukyou:	It's going to be very risky.  Ryouga and I will go to Kunou Manor
  5397		and try a direct assault as a diversion.
  5398		Then you two free Happosai and anybody else that can help.
  5399		Hopefully by the time they're on to us, we'll have enough man-power
  5400		to take on the Fang's leaders.
  5401	Tofu:	I don't like it... it's too dangerous.
  5402	Ukyou:	It's our best chance.
  5403	Lotion: Lo-shin say we attack!
  5404	Ryouga:	I guess it's the only thing we can do.
  5405	Tofu:	All right then.  But before we go, everyone take a magic sanskrit
  5406		seal.  Use it sparingly, it will paralyze one monster when put it
  5407		on it's head. 
  5408	Ryouga:	Amazing... where did you get these?
  5409	Lo-shin: Yes, your knowledge of the mystic is very intensive.
  5410	Tofu:	An an old friend of mine was heavily in the occult.
  5411		I met her in medical school, she was studying to be a nurse.
  5412	Ukyou:	A nurse?
  5413	Tofu:	Well, only as a minor.  She was a Shinto priestess fulltime.

  5416	FireWater:	I'm tired of waiting around, Mr. Tendo.
  5417	Soun:	The only thing we can do is wait for a rescue.
  5418	FW:	That's never been my style.
  5419	
  5420	[ FireWater starts spinning his head, slowly at first and then he started
  5421	  picking up speed.  With a sudden snap of his neck he flings his circular
  5422	  faceplate off.  It spins through the air and rebounds on one of Soun's
  5423	  chains and returns towards FireWater.  The disc shreds through the 
  5424	  seal on his chest.  From the angle of his hood, FireWater's face is still
  5425	  unseen being covered by shadows.] 
  5426	
  5427	FW:	Ha, beat that Lotion.
  5428		She's not the only one that can make a crack shot! 
  5429		[ ed note: See Part 4 ]
  5430	Soun:	So that's why you always wear that ugly mask.
  5431	FW:	Now to free myself.  UGH!....OW!
  5432	Soun:	Are you alright?
  5433	FW:	Yes, just a little weak.  Apparently using my Griffin technique
  5434		drained a lot more of my strength then I thought.
  5435		[ ed note: See last Part ]
  5436		I'll have to try something that doesn't requires so much strength. 
  5437		Exploding Point Technique!
  5438	
  5439	[ Hitting his finger against the stone wall, a minor explosion erupts. ]
  5440	
  5441	FW:	Just another one of my special techniques.
  5442		Cough Cough! ..OW..
  5443	Soun:	Wasn't the explosion a little too much for you?
  5444	FW:	[ bending down to recover his faceplate ]
  5445		No, when you have perfect control you can direct the exploding effect
  5446		away from you.  Only an amateur actually sets it to blow up
  5447		in his face.  [ touches his chest ]
  5448		Actually, it was a minor miscalculation with my faceplate..ouch!
  5449		I'm exhausted...
  5450	Soun:	Well, hurry up.  We haven't got all night, and get me down from here.

  5453	Ryouga:	Are you sure it's not this way?
  5454	Ukyou:	Ryouga, we agreed I would lead.
  5455	Ryouga: You must really like Ranma a lot to do this.
  5456	Ukyou:	Almost as much as you love Akane.
  5457	Ryouga:	Eh?
  5458	Ukyou:	Oh come on.  Everybody (except Akane) knows.
  5459		You're so devoted to her.
  5460	Ryouga:	Almost as much as you are to Ranma.
  5461		Although I can't see why.
  5462	Ukyou:	Eh?
  5463	Ryouga:	Here you are, a nice girl who offers Ranma everything she has to
  5464		offer, and he just puts you on hold.
  5465	Ukyou:	Oh yeah?!  What about you?  You practically bend over backwards
  5466		for Akane, but all she wants to be is "good friends" with you.
  5467		She only has eyes for Ranma!
  5468	Ryouga:	Oh yeah, for that matter Ranma really likes Akane, everyone knows it.
  5469		But he's just too much of a coward to tell her.
  5470	Ukyou:	You're no better, you can't even tell Akane!
  5471	Ryouga:	Oh yeah, at least I didn't waste half my life waiting for
  5472		a guy who ran out on you!
  5473	
  5474	Ukyou:	Shut-up!  You don't know what I went through.  I was scorned and
  5475		everyone knew it.  They'd all talk about me.  "Jilted" Ukyou, they
  5476		would call me.  And everybody would feel so sorry for the poor
  5477		girl.  Because of that I was always afraid to get close to
  5478		anybody, I never had any real friends.  My life was miserable!
  5479		Sometimes I didn't know why I bothered going on.  And it was all the
  5480		fault of the same guy I thought would love me and cherish me.  I.. I..
  5481		[ starts to cry ]
  5482	
  5483	Ryouga:	Ukyou!  I'm sorry, I'm sorry!  Don't cry!
  5484		I know I said a lot of nasty things I shouldn't have.  I didn't
  5485		mean it.  If it's any consolation, I can sympathise with you.
  5486		I've had a pretty miserable childhood too.  Since I'm always lost
  5487		and Wandering around most of the time, it's hard for me to make
  5488		friends since I rarely see them for a long time.  I have to live
  5489		with this curse and the only consolation is that the girl of my
  5490		dreams loves me as a pet.  Look, I've just had a lot of problems
  5491		boiling inside me for a long time and you just happened to the
  5492		closest target.  I'm sorry.  Can we at least be friends?
  5493	
  5494	Ukyou:	Okay, friends! [ they shake hands ]
  5495	Ryouga:	Ranma is still an idiot.
  5496	Ukyou:	Eh?
  5497	Ryouga:	He's a fool for refusing such a nice girl like you.
  5498	Ukyou:	Stop it!  You're embarrassing me! [ slaps/knocks him down ]
  5499	Ryouga:	Uhh...maybe that's why...

  5502		In the night, two figures in trenchcoats are moving up a long path.
  5503	If there were any spectators around and if they bothered to look carefully,
  5504	they would notice that the figures were fairly BIG and when they moved,
  5505	they barely made a sound.  That might not seem unusual except for the fact
  5506	the two figures were gliding about an inch off the ground.  But since it
  5507	was a deserted road, everything was normal.
  5508		"Aih-san, where are we going anyway?", the young man in one of
  5509		the trenchcoats asked his companion.
  5510	"We're tracking down some odd energy readings.", his female friend responded.
  5511	"Remeber the weird weather we've been having?", she continued.
  5512		"Yeah, that was one of the longest thunderstorms I've ever been in"
  5513	"Well I analyzed the wheather scope and it originated within the city."
  5514		"What?  That's impossible!"
  5515	"After all you've seen adn done, you should know better than to say that.
  5516	 In the ESPolice everything and anything is possible"
  5517		"So we're headed for that source nexus?"
  5518	"Bingo.  I'm not sure what we're going to find.  I cross-checked it with
  5519	 some local maps and found out our destination is at some place called
  5520	 Kunou Manor", Aih said as she popped open a small scanner.
  5521		"Kunou Manor?!  Sheesh, this is starting to sound like a bad
  5522		horror film.  First we investigate missing townspeople, then
  5523		dead bodies drained of blood appear, and then after a dark
  5524		thunderstorm we're visiting an old mansion...
  5525		Who knows, maybe we'll meet Dracula!"
  5526	"Be quiet!", Aih stammered.
  5527		"Oh no.  Brave Aih-san is getting scared!
  5528		Maybe we'll meet a ghost on the way!", Kay prodded.
  5529	"I said be quiet."
  5530		"Heheh, don't worry Aih-san, I'll protect you!"
  5531	"I said shut-up!", she whispered-yelled at him.
  5532	"There's someone coming up, shut off your hydralics and hide"
  5533		"Oh..sorry"
  5534	"Baka.", she scolded him.
  5535		The two of them shut off their hydralic air hover systems and
  5536	ducked in some bushes nearby.
  5537		"I feel stupid, why are we doing this?", Kay complained.
  5538	"Because, we don't want anyone know we're investigating."
  5539		"Just like that last couple we almost bumped into?
  5540		I hardly thought they were very threatening"
  5541	"Maybe, maybe not.  I still don't know about them."
  5542		"Why not?  Is it so unusual for a guy and a girl to be walking
  5543		all alone on a deserted path in the middle of the night?"
  5544	"Yes it is."
  5545		"Well, look at us"
  5546	"It's not just that.  The boy, I swear he had fangs!"
  5547		"Then why didn't you arrest them for questioning?"
  5548	"They might have been harmless"
  5549		"So then why are we hiding?"
  5550	"In case whoever is coming isn't"
  5551	
  5552		The two of them waited in hiding until however it was came by.
  5553	Up across the path something was definitely coming.  Whoever it was, he
  5554	wasn't bothering to be very inconspicuous.  He approached with the same
  5555	discretion as a bunch of college students who just finished their finals.
  5556	As the figure approached, it turned out to be about a half a dozen people.
  5557	They were all screaming and snarling and doing various acts of vandalism,
  5558	destroying any tree, bush or signpost in their way.
  5559		"Hey!  That's against the law", Kay silently exclaimed.
  5560	"Quiet, do you want them to hear us?", Aih reminded them.
  5561		"But we're officers of the Law!  We can't just let them.."
  5562	
  5563		Kay suddenly fell silent when he saw one of the men suddenly drop
  5564	and give off a hideous groan.  Soon he was convulsing on the ground, his
  5565	very skin and face distorting.  After several seconds the man started
  5566	shrinking and metamorphasising into a large brown colored bat.
  5567	The bat gave off a shriek and started flying off.
  5568		"Mo...Monster....", Kay and Aih both stuttered out.

  5581	Ranma:	Ranma is no more, there is now only Dark-Ranma.
  5582	Ukyou:	Wait!  I'll make a deal, I'll give up this boy in exchange for
  5583		Ran-chan's freedom.

  5809	Green:	C'mon!  C'mon!  Let's fight!
  5810	
  5811	[ The two run towards each other and cross.  Both only hit cloth.
  5812	  GreenCoat recovers first and leaps back to swing a fast punch.
  5813	  Tofu-sensei actually catches it and reverses it to put GreenCoat
  5814	  into a half nelson. ]
  5815	
  5816	Green:	ARRH!!  You're good.
  5817	
  5818	[ GreenCoat jumps into the air to get more leverage and does a quick
  5819	  kick to Tofu-sense.  Tofu-sensei dodges the blow but loses his hold
  5820	  on GreenCoat. ]
  5821	
  5822	Green:	REAL good.
  5823	
  5824	[ Tofu-sensei feints a right cross and strikes GreenCoat's side with
  5825	  his other hand's finger.  While GreenCoat winces in pain, Tofu sensei
  5826	  leaps on top of his back and grabs his neck ]
  5827	
  5828	Tofu:	Please forgive me, I'm a doctor.
  5829	Green:	We are warriors!  Finish it!
  5830	
  5831	[ With a sickening crack, Tofu-sensei twists GreenCoat's neck in a very
  5832	  awkward position ] 
  5833	
  5834	Tofu:	It's over.
  5835	Green:	!!!
  5836	Tofu:	Your neck is dislocated.  I wouldn't move if I were you.
  5837		If you don't remain absolutely still, you'll cause yourself a great
  5838		deal of pain. 
  5839	
  5840	[ Tofu sensei starts to leave ]
  5841	
  5842	Green:	[singsong] Oh Dr. Tofu...
  5843	
  5844	[ He turns around to see GreenCoat's back.  With a loud sickening snapping
  5845	  noise,  GreenCoat twists his head around 180 degrees toward Tofu sensei ]
  5846	
  5847	Tofu:	You're not human...!
  5848	
  5849	[ GreenCoat then spits out acid from his mouth striking Tofu-sensei in the
  5850	  chest. ]
  5851	
  5852	Green:	You're very good but you're just no match for me.
  5853		Like you said, you're only human.  Take his body away.
  5854	
  5855	[ As his minions drag Tofu-sensei's convulsing form away, GreenCoat does a
  5856	  quick twist of his neck and resets his neck in its proper position. ]
  5857	
  5858	Green:	Ah, feels great to get those kinks out.
  5859	
  5860			*		*		*
  5861	[ In another chamber, Ukyou is holding her own against Kodachi while Ryouga
  5862	  is hard pressed by both Kunou and Mousse.  Ukyou and Ryouga then back off
  5863	  from their opponents and head towards each other back to back.  Ukyou
  5864	  then suddenly turns throws something at Kunou's forehead, it's one of
  5865	  Tofu-sensei's magic seals.  However Kunou just rips it off ]
  5866	
  5867	Ukyou:	The seals, they're not working!
  5868	Kunou:	Of course not!  We are no ghouls!  We willingly serve the Fang!
  5869	Ryouga: They're playing for keeps, we can't afford to hold back either.
  5870	Ukyou:	No, there has to be another way.
  5871	Ryouga:	We're out powered and out numbered.
  5872		What other way is there?!
  5873	Ukyou:	Dr. Tofu warned us about our dark halves for a reason..
  5874	Ryouga:	I don't think he was talking about now..
  5875		Look out!
  5876	
  5877	[ Suddenly the wall behind them collapses.  Ryouga pushes Ukyou out of
  5878	  the way only to be buried in rubble. ]
  5879	
  5880	Shampoo: Nihao!  [ looks down at Ryouga ]
  5881		Oh... "Bye-Bye"!
  5882	
  5883	[ Shampoo, who is wearing dark glasses similar to Ranma, raises her
  5884	  battle rods and is about to crush Ryouga's head ]
  5885	
  5886	Ukyou:	Not yet!
  5887	
  5888	[ Ukyou takes a swipe at Shampoo with her spatula, which Shampoo easily
  5889	  blocks with her Balloon-rods.  The others then surround Ukyou and close
  5890	  in for the kill.  Ukyou unleashes a barrage of flying spatulas to keep
  5891	  them at bay.  Kunou blocks with his wooden sword while Kodachi spins her
  5892	  ribbons to form a primitive shield.  Mousse however opens up a fan shield
  5893	  and throws out a chain which catches Ukyou's leg.  He wastes no time in
  5894	  pulling her off balance. ]
  5895	
  5896	Shampoo: Gotcha!
  5897	
  5898	[ Shampoo sees her opening and rams her rod into Ukyou's back.
  5899	  She goes limp and drops her spatula-staff.  By now Ryouga has recovered 
  5900	  but is still too stunned to move ]
  5901	
  5902	Ryouga:	Ukyou...
  5903	
  5904	Kodachi: And now we settle our score.
  5905	Ryouga:	Look out!
  5906	Ukyou:	Can't breath..
  5907	
  5908	[ Kodachi has whipped her ribbon around Ukyou's neck and is choking her.
  5909	  Ukyou reaches for one of her smaller spatulas but Kunou knocks it out of
  5910	  her hand with a sword thrust to her wrist.  Kodachi gives a snap to the
  5911	  ribbon sending  Ukyou flying upwards.  On the way down the ribbon catches
  5912	  on a railing and Ukyou is essentially left hanging. ]
  5913	
  5914	Ryouga:	Ukyou!  
  5915	Kunou:	You're next!
  5916	
  5917	[ Gathering his strength, Ryouga rushes out of the rubble.
  5918	  Kunou is the first to attack.  In a single stroke he swings his sword
  5919	  down at him.  But Ryouga just catches the sword and flings it across the
  5920	  room.  Unfortunately for Kunou, he was still holding on to it.
  5921	  Before the others have a chance to react, Ryouga sends his umbrella 
  5922	  twirling around like a mad rotor, forcing them all to take cover.
  5923	  Ryouga quickly runs up to Ukyou and throws one of his spinning bandanas
  5924	  to cut her down.  But as he catches Ukyou's falling form, Kodachi managed
  5925	  to recover and throws one of her spiked batons at him.  Too engrossed with
  5926	  catching Ukyou, the baton slashes Ryouga across his arm. ]
  5927	
  5928	Ryouga:	ARRH!  Fighting dirty, don't you believe in an honor code?!
  5929	Kodachi: Hohohohoh!  The only honor is in winning the fight!
  5930	
  5931	[ She throws more batons at him, but by now Ryouga has Ukyou safely in his
  5932	  arms.  He counters by throwing more of his spinning bandanas.  The two
  5933	  spinning weapons meet and Ryouga's bandanas cut right through Kodachi's
  5934	  batons.  But they're still going and head straight for Kodachi's head.
  5935	  Luckily for her, Mousse intercepts it with one of his own projectiles ]
  5936	
  5937	Mousse:	Look at us, you cannot win.  Give up.
  5938	
  5939	[ Ryouga barely catches Shampoo's thrusting balloon-rod sneak attack from
  5940	  behind. ] 
  5941	
  5942	Ryouga:	You really expected me to fall for such an obvious distraction?!
  5943	Shampoo: Rats!  I lost the bet.  You're not as dense as we thought.
  5944	Ryouga:	Do you just think this is a game?!
  5945	
  5946	[ Holding the end of her rod, Ryouga angrily squeezes the rod into powder
  5947	  with his bare hands ]
  5948	
  5949	Kunou:	Prepare for the end!
  5950	
  5951	[ Kunou suddenly leaps out at Ryouga, sword raised high.
  5952	  At that time Ryouga's spinning umbrella returns and knocks Kunou
  5953	  over as it returns to it's master's hand. ]
  5954	
  5955	Ryouga:	Who's next?!	
  5956	Mousse: You can't hold out against all of us!
  5957	Shampoo: It's only a matter of time before your injury overtakes you..
  5958	Kodachi: And before it's too late for Ukyou.
  5959	Ryouga:	Bug-off!
  5960	
  5961	[ Grasping his umbrella, he slams it into the ground causing a shockwave
  5962	  that sweeps everyone off their feet.  In the short reprise he has, Ryouga
  5963	  checks on Ukyou's condition, she's as pale as a ghost. ]
  5964	
  5965	Ryouga:	Ukyou, breathe!
  5966	Ukyou:	Cough Cough...
  5967	Ryouga:	Stay still, don't try to move.
  5968	Ukyou:	Ryouga, hold me.  Why am I so cold...  Am I dying?...
  5969	Ryouga:	...
  5970	Ukyou:	I guess Ran-chan can be happy now with Akane...
  5971		If you see him, tell him to not to have any regrets and...
  5972	Ryouga:	Don't talk like that!  You're just delirious..
  5973	Ukyou:	....
  5974	Ryouga:	Ukyou, talk to me..  Ukyou! [ No response ]
  5975		[ her voice echos in his mind ]
  5976		"Ranma can be happy now with Akane..."
  5977	
  5978	[ By this time the others have recovered ]
  5979	Kunou:	You've only bought yourself an extra moment of life..
  5980	
  5981	Ryouga:	NOOO!!  LION'S DEATH ROAR!
  5982	
  5983	[ With tears streaming from his eyes, Ryouga calls his most powerful
  5984	technique.  In one arm he holds Ukyou's unmoving form and in the other he is
  5985	firmly grasping his pole as a focus.  His explosive power causes the very
  5986	air to be charged up.  His surrounding enemies are thrown completely clear
  5987	along with the surrounding territory.  His energy spiral extended to 50
  5988	feet in diameter and runs through the ceiling, through the mansion, and even
  5989	through the heavens.  ]
  5990	
  5991	[ From inside the central part of the mansion, the strike commander,
  5992	sitting in his chair, looks up at the energy release.  He folds up his dark
  5993	robes and puts on his black helmet preparing for battle. ]
  5994	
  5995	Commander: That one is *strong*.
  5996	
  5997			*		*		*
  5998	
  5999	Lo-shin: That tremor!  It must be the signal.  They must be in great danger.
  6000		I must do this.
  6001	
  6002	[ Sighing, Lotion looks around to make sure no one is watching her.
  6003	  Lotion reluctantly puts down her chain on a nearby stone block.  
  6004	  The chain she recieved from Ryouga just instills her a great sense of
  6005	  security, like a security blanket.  Maybe because it's one of the best
  6006	  weapons she ever held. 
  6007	  She slowly slides off her tight fitting pants very carefully.  Then she just
  6008	  stands here in her long shirt gathering up her nerve ]
  6009	
  6010	Lo-shin: Lotion can't believe this will really awaken the ancient fighter.
  6011	
  6012	Taihen:	Well, it's doing wonders for me.
  6013	
  6014	Lo-shin: Who?  You!
  6015	
  6016	Taihen:	Hey!  Don't stop on my account.
  6017		Although it won't really help you at all.
  6018		You see, we knew you were coming, so we moved the target.
  6019	
  6020	Lo-shin: What!
  6021	
  6022	Taihen:	You really are a bunch of amateurs.
  6023		Hey, I recognize you!  You're from that village we destroyed!
  6024		You know, I think you are the cutest little thing to ever come
  6025		out China.  Why don't we both confirm it, yes?
  6026	
  6027	[ Pushing her down, he falls on top of her on the hard granite floor.]
  6028	
  6029	Taihen:	Quit sniveling, I want to see what you've got.
  6030		Relax, all your friends liked it afterwards..
  6031	
  6032	Lo-shin: You, monster!
  6033	Taihen:	Not just a monster, a vampire monster.
  6034		And a pretty studly one too, if I may so modestly add..
  6035	
  6036	[ Lotion tries to resist but he just laughs and slaps her down.
  6037	  As he starts to rip open her shirt, Lotion's mind retreats to the
  6038	  days when she was home in her village.  Her thoughts drifts to 
  6039	  the good times she shared with her friends, Eye Shadow, Conditioner, Blush,
  6040	  Soap... and many more.  All who might be dead because of the monster
  6041	  on top of her.  In her heart she weeps for her lost comrades. ]
  6042	
  6043	Lo-shin: No... NOOO!!
  6044	Taihen:	That's it, I love it when they play hard to get.
  6045	
  6046	[ Lotion suddenly grabs him in a tight embrace. ]
  6047	
  6048	Taihen:	Whoa, you like it rough?
  6049	
  6050	[ She then sweeps her leg under her and flips him over. ]
  6051	
  6052	Taihen:	Ouch!  Why you little..
  6053	
  6054	[ Lotion quickly springs up and grasps for her chain.  Once attained, she
  6055	  starts spinning it around in a defensive posture ]
  6056	
  6057	Taihen:	You know, there's nothing more sexier than a half naked sweating girl
  6058		covered in spikes and chains.  You know, you're really turning me on.
  6059	
  6060	Lo-shin: Shutup!
  6061	
  6062	[ Lotion swings the chain at him, but Taihen easily catches it ]
  6063	
  6064	Taihen:	Are you sure you want to fight?  You do know what happens when
  6065		you lose...
  6066	
  6067	[ Suddenly the chain erupts up in a flare of white light ]
  6068	
  6069	Taihen:	ARRH!! My hand!
  6070	
  6071	[ He immediately drops his end of the chain and checks his hand, it has
  6072	burn marks where he was holding the chain.  Lotion swings the chain again
  6073	and this time connects right with his face. ]
  6074	
  6075	Taihen:	ARRHHH!  That hurt!  That actually hurt!
  6076	
  6077	[ Taihen tries to recover but the blow was too powerful.  Again and again
  6078	  Lotion lashes out at her target, with every strike the chain starts
  6079	  glowing brighter and brighter and begins burning hotter and hotter with a
  6080	  light  of vengeance. ]
  6081	
  6082	Taihen: Who..who are you?!
  6083	
  6084	Lotion: I am Lo-shin of the Joketsuzoku clan.
  6085		You killed my family.  Prepare to die.
  6086	
  6087	[ Lotion lets out a death cry and leaps toward Taihen who collapses on his
  6088	face while covering his head with his hands. ]
  6089	
  6090	Taihen:	Help!!!
  6091	
  6092	Purple:	You can open your eyes now.
  6093	
  6094	Taihen:	PurpleCoat?...  How long were you there?
  6095	
  6096	Purple:	Long enough. 
  6097	
  6098	Taihen:	And you just stood there and watched and ...
  6099	
  6100	Green:  [ munching on some popcorn ] ..Let her beat the tar out of you. 
  6101		Wow! It was great!  Plot was good, action was fast-paced,
  6102		lots of skin and an awesome fight scene with special effects!
  6103		Who needs to go to the movies!
  6104	
  6105	Purple:	Green, get out of here before I start on you.
  6106		Go check on the other slave's progress.
  6107	
  6108	Green:	Well, it was fun.  I gave it one fang up.  [ exits ]
  6109	
  6110	Purple:	She really had you on the ropes.
  6111	
  6112		[ suddenly Lotion stirs. ]
  6113	
  6114	Taihen:	Actually it was a chain.  Are you sure she's unconscious?
  6115	Purple:	Yes, she didn't even see me coming.  
  6116		She was too busy kicking your sorry hide.
  6117		[ stares at the chain Lotion is holding on to ]
  6118		In any case I think I've just solved the unusual bio-readings
  6119		I've been sensing.
  6120		[ Suddenly he strikes Taihen ]
  6121	
  6122	Taihen:	OW!  What was that for?
  6123	Purple:	You were supposed to neutralize your target and get back
  6124		in case they had other reinforcements, not indulge in your
  6125		petty fantasies.  If you ever pull a stunt like this again,
  6126		I'll personally have you for breakfast. 
  6127		Do you want us to lose our sales?!  We already had enough trouble
  6128		with that Miyuzaki guy freaking out all those parents groups!
  6129			*		*		*
  6130	
  6131	FireWater: So far so good, no encounters yet.
  6132		I'm not sure about Dr. Tofu and the others,
  6133		but we may be the last two. 
  6134	Soun:	No other reinforcements?
  6135	FW:	Yes.  If that's the case, our only chance may be to assassinate
  6136		their Strike Commander and cripple the whole operation.
  6137		We'll only get one chance, we better make it count.
  6138		Just give me a minute to rest...
  6139	Soun:	Oh, I will.
  6140	
  6141	[ Soun pulls out a stake from his shirt ]
  6142	
  6143	FW:	Oh good, you've already found a weapon.
  6144		Well, let's go.
  6145	
  6146	[ And then he stabs FireWater in the back.
  6147	  FireWater wriggles in pain as the stake pierces right through his back
  6148	  into his heart. In defiance he tries to scream out a challenge but only a
  6149	  bloody gurgle erupts from his lips as Soun drives the stake even deeper. ]
  6150	
  6151	FW:	...Why?
  6152	Green:	I believe I can answer that, Tendo here is now working for us.
  6153	Soun:	Yes, Master.
  6154	FW:	GC?  You're... here.. too..?
  6155	Green:	Fellow prisoners make the best unsuspecting betrayals,
  6156		don't you agree?
  6157	FireWater: You can't win, GC.  If I die I'll only become more
  6158		powerful than ever.
  6159	
  6160	[ As FireWater is bent on the ground in pain trying to pull out the stake,
  6161	  GreenCoat calmly steps on the stake in his back and drives it in even
  6162	  deeper ]
  6163	
  6164	FW:	ARRHHH!!!
  6165	Green:	Is that a fact, Jo?
  6166	
  6167			*		*		*
  6168		He was in trouble.  Captain Zen realized this an hour ago when
  6169	he was lost, searching for that darn city.  He couldn't understand it.
  6170	All his computer readouts should have pinpointed the exact location but for
  6171	some reason the city still escaped him.  Then he got caught in that
  6172	thunderstorm.  Totally blew him off course and scrambled a lot of his
  6173	systems.  He even lost communications with headquarters.
  6174		Now, as his fuel reserves are empty, his solar batteries almost
  6175	exhausted with out a decent solar source to repower them, he was wondering
  6176	what the heck he was thinking flying down here by himself in a Delta unit.
  6177	Now he was in DEEP trouble.  But one thing about Captain Zen was that no
  6178	matter how disasterous his decisions have been, his gut feeling always
  6179	turned out right.  But if he didn't find a proper landing zone soon he
  6180	might crash and be stuck in a deserted wilderness with no chance of
  6181	survival.  So much for gut feelings.
  6182		Then the energy cone appeared.  He never seen anything like it.  It
  6183	just blew all his sensors off the scale.  The funny thing was after that,
  6184	the storm started to break.  Well, he had a target, he was going to move
  6185	in.  His gut feeling was telling him that this was it.  Captain Zen was
  6186	always glad whenever he was right.

  6189	
  6190	[ In the darkness, Ryouga is holding on to Ukyou's still form.
  6191	  Already she is getting cold to the touch.  In the darkness, there is a
  6192	  soft sobbing and a promise of retribution. ]
  6193	
  6194	Ryouga:	"Vengeance is mine, ..."
  6195	
  6196	[ His eyes glow afire with the intensity of his promise.
  6197	  He places her body gently on the ground.  He looks at her silent form in
  6198	  the moonlight for a short moment.  He makes a silent prayer and then
  6199	  fishes for some shining circular object from his backpack.  He places it
  6200	  on her chest.  Finally he marks her position by stabbing her spatula-staff
  6201	  into the ground above her.  He takes a moment to tie one of his bandanas
  6202	  around his arm wound, then gathers his things and runs on down the
  6203	  corridor ]

  6225	Here's part 8 as we continue to poke fun at one of my favorite sf movies.
  6226	For those of you who feel the ESPolice are a waste of time,
  6227	there really is a point to them, I just have to think of it.
  6228	Hmm, does taking up filler space count?

  6240	THE STORY SO FAR:
  6241	
  6242		It's been a really crazy time here, recollected GreenCoat.
  6243	First I just had a simple assignment to subjugate this town by the Boss.
  6244	It was rather straight forward, infiltrating the city and slowly
  6245	transforming the denizens first into zombie slaves and then into full
  6246	Vampire Fang Troopers.  Of course there was also a rich amount of
  6247	competent fighters to use as Dark Slaves, some people known as Kunou,
  6248	Kodachi, Mousse, Shampoo and possibly the most powerful: Ranma.
  6249	Other converts have been our human agent, Nabiki who basically just wants
  6250	to side with the winners, something I can understand.  And of course
  6251	Gosunkugi, who is know a full fledged Fang Trooper.  Purple's a bit
  6252	wary about him, since he awakened in only one day when it normally takes a
  6253	victim three.  I just think it's because he's been his mental slave for so
  6254	long and deep down the kid actually WANTS to be one of us.  Another thing I
  6255	can relate to as well.
  6256		But it hasn't all been fun and games.  We've been put on a tight
  6257	schedule.  Apparently this is the pivotal city that will enable the Fang to
  6258	full control the nation and then the world.  Of course there has been
  6259	intervention by my and Purple's old "friend", Jo FireWater and the champion 
  6260	good guy known, even to us, only as the Wanderer.  Luckily all of these
  6261	factors as well as the resistance have been taken care of.  Most of the
  6262	resistance fighters have been rounded up.  There are only a few minor loose
  6263	ends to take care of.  Soun is on our side, Tofu has been neutralized and
  6264	the girl, Lotion, (what a babe!  Taihen sure knows how to pick'em), seems
  6265	to hold the key to Purple's detection problems.  He said he'd explain more
  6266	later. 
  6267		We finally unleashed a vampire hoarde onto the city this night.
  6268	The time for secrecy is over.  It's time for us to take a firm hold
  6269	on this town.  The only thing that can possibly stop us is some outside
  6270	influence.  But that only happens in the funny books.  I think I've been
  6271	working at this too long, I'm beginning to think in plot summaries.+
  6272	
  6273	-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
  6274	
  6275		In the standard beginning of every new scene where a person was
  6276	transported while unonscious, Lo-shin awakened into darkness.  She slowly sat
  6277	up rubbing her head.  Whoever knocked her out was a real professional.
  6278	Just be feeling the angle of the hit, the person who knocked her out had
  6279	done this sort of thing hundreds of times before.  Ignoring her headache,
  6280	she tried to remember exactly what happened.  The last thing she remembered
  6281	was fighting with the stranger.  She recognized him from the village.  What
  6282	did he call himself, Taihen?  She knew him as the stranger.  He arrived at
  6283	the village not too long ago.  He claimed to just be a friendly visitor.
  6284	She never trusted him.  Every day he would go around hitting on all the
  6285	girls.  When they refused his attentions he started becoming violent and
  6286	attacked them.  Of course the village elders only dismissed it part of the
  6287	customary battle ritual, but Lo-shin could not.  She was mad, she wanted to
  6288	try and knock down the stranger's ego down.  The only thing that stopped
  6289	her was her brother who refused to let her anywhere near the stranger. 
  6290		Ever since that stranger came, that's when the trouble began with
  6291	the other village.  She couldn't really remember the details but she knew
  6292	that somehow he was responsible for it.  Disputes escalated into full blown
  6293	battles.  The situation was so volitile, Shampoo's Great Grandmother was
  6294	called back to help.  That's when her family went to fight at the front
  6295	line.  A day later, one of the elders sent her to China to deliver a
  6296	special message to Shampoo.  And now thanks to the fates, the stranger has
  6297	followed her.  His words kept echoing in her mind.  The way he bragged
  6298	about how he personally destroyed her village.  She wished she could have
  6299	another chance to kill him.  Nothing mattered to her now but revenge.  Her
  6300	home was gone, there was nothing left for her.  The life that she knew was
  6301	no more, and it was all his fault.  Suddenly she started crying, the tears
  6302	just came flowing out.  Although she may not know why in her head, she knew
  6303	why in her hart.  She was crying over her loss in this life.  She cried for
  6304	her friends.  She cried for her village, for her family, for Mousse, for
  6305	Shampoo.  Shivering in the cold, she wrapped her torn shirt around her and
  6306	hugged herself tightly.  She also cried because she knew that despite her
  6307	bravo, she almost lost her fight with the stranger.  His sneering face kept
  6308	haunting her even in her dreams.  And when one of the Joketsuzoku clan
  6309	loses a fight, they lose more than just the battle.  
  6310			*		*		*
  6311	
  6312		Ryouga was running through the halls and bulldozing anything in his
  6313	path.  Nothing but vengeance burned in his heart.  He still remembered
  6314	Ukyou's cold body laying in his arms.  Her last words still haunted him:
  6315	"Tell Ranma to be happy now with Akane".  Wiping away his tears, Ryouga
  6316	just picked up speed.  Soon he reached a large set of double doors.
  6317	This must be the place, the central room where the ringleaders dwelled.
  6318	Ryouga tried ramming down the door but suprisingly it held fast.
  6319	No matter how many blows he gave it, the door refused to open.
  6320	Crying in anguish he just kept pounding until finally exhaustion 
  6321	wore him down.  Cursing his weakness, Ryouga sat down.  Suddenly a voice
  6322	rang inside his head.  "Use your Force....", it moaned.  The voice
  6323	sounded familar but he just couldn't place it.  But there were more
  6324	important concerns.  He gathered up his concentration, gripped his
  6325	umbrella firmly, pointed it in the direction of the door and exclaimed,
  6326	"Exploding Point Technique!", and then charged.
  6327	
  6328			*		*		*
  6329		In a once-upon-a-time-peaceful clearing, but now a post-battle-
  6330	mindless-destruction disaster area, ESPolice officers Aih and Kay were
  6331	resting from their recent encounter with some of the Fang's newly bred
  6332	vampire horde.  
  6333		"That was the last one.", Kay consoled Aih.
  6334	"They were horrible.", Aih was still a little shocked.
  6335		"Aih-san.   It was either them or us.  You did what you had to do."
  6336	"I'm not sure if I'm glad to get rid of such.. things.. or just shocked
  6337	 at what I did to another living being."
  6338		"Well, if it's any consolation, they're not dead."
  6339	"What!?", Aih started strangling Kay.
  6340	"What are you talking about?!  Do you know how much damage we inflicted on
  6341	 them?!  Nothing could have lived through that!  Nothing...", she let go of
  6342	Kay and just stood there in silence.
  6343		Sometimes, Kay thought.  Sometimes I really don't know if this is
  6344	the line of work that's right for us.  He hated being the one in charge,
  6345	but Aih-san was in no condition to give orders.  Meeting ghouls and goblins
  6346	always frightened her, much less fighting them.  Heck, even he was
  6347	shell-shocked by the night's encounters.
  6348		"Aih-san, listen to me.. Listen to me!", he said a little more
  6349	forcefully.
  6350		"We have a job to do.  If things like this are going on, who knows
  6351	how many other people are suffering.  We gotta find out what's going on."
  6352	"You're right", she said, breaking the silence.
  6353		"Besides, like I said, I don't think they're dead"
  6354	"But we just.."
  6355		"Hear me out.  I'm not saying that they should be alive but
  6356		 these things have the characteristics of vampires.
  6357		 You know what that means. "
  6358	"They'll return from the dead.", she finished for him.
  6359		"Unless we take measures to avoid that.", he opened his hand to
  6360		reveal a set of sharp stakes.
  6361	"There's got to be another way.  I.. I can't do it."
  6362		"We have to continue our investigation.  But we can't just leave
  6363		them here.  What if they recover and come after us?  Or what if
  6364		they go down into the city and attack innocent people?"
  6365	"You're right again, Kay-kun.", Aih picked up up a stake into her
  6366	trembling hand. 
  6367	
  6368			*		*		*
  6369		Suddenly from the darkness a patch of light appeared.  The guards
  6370	were opening up the door.  Lo-shin thought about ambushing them, but she was
  6371	still too weak physically and emotionally.  She huddled into a corner and
  6372	wiped away her tears with her torn sleeve.  The guards roughly tossed
  6373	someone in.  Lotion carefully looked over to see who it was.  The figure
  6374	groaned and put his hand to his chest as if checking for an injury.
  6375	The person then looked up to take in his surroundings. 
  6376	
  6377	"Dr. Tofu!", Lo-shin exclaimed in joy.
  6378	"Lo-shin so worried about you", she said as she ran up to hug him.
  6379		"Lotion, OUCH!  Please don't squeeze too hard.  I'm still very weak."
  6380	"Lo-shin sorry. What...", she said puzzled, as she stared at a black splotch
  6381	on his chest.
  6382		"Don't worry, it's only some acid.  I received a minor burn.."
  6383	"They torture you?!", Lo-shin asked worried
  6384		"No, no need to be concerned.  That's just how they caught me.
  6385		Lotion, what happened to you?", Tofu-sensei asked staring at her
  6386		torn attire.
  6387	"Big fight... they..", she mumbled out.
  6388		"They didn't... *hurt*.. you, did they?", Tofu-sensei asked concerned.
  6389	"N-No.. Lo-shin too strong for them..", she replied hesitantly
  6390		"Well, you must be cold.  Here take my shirt.", Tofu-sensei wrapped
  6391		his longer shirt over her in a feeble attempt to cover her.
  6392	"Many thanks, Tofu-san.", Lo-shin softly said.  Maybe it was his warm
  6393	smile.  Maybe it was the safetly she felt in his strong arms.  Maybe it was
  6394	becasue she was just a frightened sixteen year old girl.  Maybe it was
  6395	the fact that she was tired of keeping up her brave front.  Maybe it was
  6396	just that he looked just as vulnerable as she did, sitting there in the
  6397	darkness in his bare chest. 
  6398	"I was so scared!", Lo-shin cried out and buried her face in his chest sobbing.
  6399		"There there...let it all out.", Tofu-sensei consoled her and tried
  6400		his best to comfort her.
  6401		"I won't let anyone hurt you.", he promised, hoping that somehow
  6402	he could keep his word.  They were both to weak to even escape.  In the
  6403	distance the sounds of footsteps were echoing, heading towards their cell. 
  6404			*		*		*
  6405	
  6406	[ In the main council chamber, the Fang leaders are meeting ]
  6407	
  6408	Green:	You finally figured out what was all the weird readings you
  6409		were sensing?
  6410	Purple:	That's right.  But first I want to know what you said about Jo.
  6411		You subdued him?
  6412	Green:	Yup, me and our mental slave, Soun, took care of him.
  6413	Purple:	Impressive.  So where is he?
  6414	Green:	You know how dangerous he was, we had to eliminate him.
  6415	Purple:	You what?.. So where's the body?
  6416	Green:	The body?
  6417	Purple:	Yes, you know, the body, the corpse, the remains...
  6418		We need it so we can ensure he can never return.
  6419	Green:	He, it, um, discorporated.  Nothing was left except his robes and his
  6420		faceplate...
  6421	Purple:	You idiot!!  That leaves him free to take over another host body!
  6422	Green:	He can do that?
  6423	Purple:	He's a renegade, remember?
  6424	Green:	Even for us it's...
  6425	Purple:	He's a very special case.
  6426	Green:	But I thought he had morals against that.
  6427	Purple:	Well, sometimes morals go out the window when faced with oblivion.
  6428		This could be a problem if he picks a very strong new body.
  6429	Green:	And I thought he was bluffing...
  6430	Purple:	Wait.. Another disturbance.  Another piece of the puzzle is coming.
  6431	Commander: We'll continue this later.
  6432	
  6433			*		*		*
  6434	
  6435	Kasumi:	Akane, I think there's someone in here.
  6436	Akane:	Is it Ranma?
  6437	Kasumi:	Well whoever it is, I'm sure they want to be let out.
  6438	Akane:	Well, I guess any prisoners here are friends of ours.
  6439		Stand back.
  6440	
  6441	[ Taking a deep breath, Akane lets out a series of well placed kicks and
  6442	  punches.  Soon, the creaky door relented and slamms open inwards. ]
  6443	
  6444	Voice:	Don't hurt us!
  6445	Akane:	Calm down, we're hear to rescue yo...
  6446	
  6447	[ Inside are Tofu-sensei and Lotion.  From their viewpoint Tofu-sensei
  6448	  has a young girl in his arms who looks like the only thing she has on
  6449	  is a shirt, which just happens to be *his* shirt.  The girl is huddled
  6450	  against Tofu-sensei and grasping him with all her strength ]
  6451	
  6452	Akane:	Sensei...
  6453	Lo-shin: Kyaaaa!!  Who are they?!
  6454	Tofu:	Please Lotion-chan, I told you not to squeeze so hard..
  6455		Akane..!
  6456	Akane & Tofu: What are you doing here?
  6457	Tofu:	I thought I told you to leave the city.
  6458	Akane:	I never knew....
  6459	
  6460	[ Akane has the usual shocked look on her face, bulging eyeballs.
  6461	  Tofu sensei finally realizes how this must seem ]
  6462	
  6463	Tofu:	Ummm... This isn't what it looks like...
  6464	Kasumi:	Akane, is everyone all right in there.. OH!
  6465	Tofu:	Kasumi?!
  6466	Kasumi:	[ blushing ] Please excuse us.
  6467		Let's go, Akane.
  6468	
  6469	[ Kasumi quickly grabs Akane's hand and drags her outside.  Then she
  6470	  swiftly closes the door ]
  6471	
  6472	Kasumi:	Let's go on, Akane.
  6473	Akane:	But, Sister...  Tofu-sensei..
  6474	Kasumi:	Akane, it's not proper to talk about such things.
  6475		Let's go.
  6476	Akane:	[ thinking ] Kasumi...
  6477	
  6478	[ From a voice in the distance ]
  6479	
  6480	Tofu:	The door!  It's jammed shut!  Come back!  SIGH!
  6481	
  6482			*		*		*
  6483	
  6484		Elsewhere a set of double doors explode inwards.  A figure stumbles
  6485	in, being caught in the middle of the explosion.  After walking near the
  6486	center, he stands tall, burning with vengeance. 
  6487	
  6488	Ryouga:	I am Hibiki Ryouga.
  6489	
  6490	Purple:	Welcome.  We've been expecting you.
  6491	Ryouga:	Who's in charge here ?!   [ points his umbrella ]
  6492	
  6493	[ At the far end of the room a figure turns in his chair.  He is dressed
  6494	  in long shiny black flowing robes and is wearing some sort of dark war
  6495	  helmet ] 
  6496	
  6497	Commander: That would be me.  I am the Strike Commander.
  6498	
  6499	Ryouga:	Roaring Lion Bullet!
  6500	
  6501	[ Ryouga throws a couple of force-blasts at the Commander.
  6502	  The Commander just raises his palms and blocks every shot. ]
  6503	
  6504	Ryouga:	Na..Nani?! (WH-AT?!)
  6505	[ ed note: sorry but you don't get the same theatrical effect in english ]
  6506	Commander: Heh, Your power is too weak.
  6507	
  6508	[ Ryouga raises his umbrella but suddenly it flies up into the air and
  6509	  flies toward the Commander's hand ]
  6510	
  6511	Commander:  I think I'll just take this away from you.
  6512		You've had enough of a power focus...
  6513		[ the umbrella handle flies into his hand ]
  6514		Oof!  Heavy!
  6515		[ and the top end of the umbrella drops like a dead weight ]
  6516	
  6517	Ryouga:	I'll kill you with my bare hands!
  6518	Purple: That will be unnecessary.  Arm him.
  6519	
  6520	[ A figure in a long Green overcoat tosses Ryouga a glowing sword.
  6521	  Ryouga deftly catches it.   GreenCoat likewise has his own.]
  6522	
  6523	Ryouga:	What's this?
  6524	Commander: You will now duel with your Lightswords.
  6525	Green:	Let's fight! [ thrusts ]
  6526	Ryouga:	I won't lose!
  6527	
  6528	[ The two give various parrys and thrusts, but Ryouga is a bit slow ]
  6529	
  6530	Green:	I can feel your anguish.  You are not preforming your best.
  6531	Ryouga:	This is the first time I've held a real sword..
  6532	Green:	You are letting your emotions cloud your judgement.
  6533		Anger is dominating your feelings, you cannot defeat me that way.
  6534	Ryouga:	[ thinking ] He's right...  I could barely summon up enough
  6535		power for a Force-blast...
  6536	Green:	Release your hate, release your anger!
  6537	Ryouga:	[ remembering ] "Ranma can now be happy with Akane...."
  6538		AAHHHH!!!  I'll kill you!
  6539	
  6540	[ Ryouga attacks with new vigor.  He goes more on the offensive.
  6541	  Soon GreenCoat can barely block all the blows.  In the last exchange
  6542	  GreenCoat's LightSword is knocked out of his hand ]
  6543	
  6544	Ryouga:	Prepare for the end!
  6545	Green:	Not likely.
  6546	
  6547	[ Ryouga swings his LightSword down in a killing arc.  Just before contact,
  6548	GreenCoat clasps his hands around Ryouga's blade, stopping his blow ]
  6549	
  6550	Ryouga:	HOW?!
  6551	Green:	When you've got it, flaunt it.
  6552		[ GreenCoat celebrates by quickly raising and lowering his eyebrows ]
  6553		<Point!> <Point!>
  6554	Purple:	Actually they're only battery operated toy light swords he got
  6555		on sale.  We wanted to see how good a swordsman you are.
  6556	Green:	What, do you think I'll be dumb enough to give you a
  6557		weapon that might actually kill me?
  6558	Ryouga:	I'll kill you with my bare hands!
  6559	
  6560	Commander: Enough, this has ceased to bring even the slighest amount of
  6561		amusement.  You will now cease your hostilities.
  6562	
  6563	Ryouga:	My throat...!  Can't breathe....
  6564		[ As the Strike Commander clenches his fist, Ryouga starts gasping
  6565		for  breath. ]
  6566		I won't give up.. This won't stop me Gasp..
  6567		[ And then a large boulder drops on top of him. ]
  6568	
  6569	Commander: How about that? [ Ryouga lies unconsicious ]
  6570	
  6571	Purple:	[ staring at the shiny top of Ryouga's umbrella ]
  6572		Yes, another piece of the puzzle...
  6573

  6575	<Commercial 1>
  6576		Hello, my name is Miyu.  I just wanted to take a little time out to
  6577	talk to you about the importance of safety.  I know, sometimes it's hard to
  6578	seperate fantasy and reality.  When a woman walks down the street after
  6579	dawn, she shouldn't be paralyzed by fear.  It is the responsibility of all
  6580	women to help stop this violation of their our natural freedom to move
  6581	about.  As women, we're known as the weaker sex, but that doesn't have to
  6582	be the case.  Be smart and cautious, that's all you need to travel in
  6583	safety.  It's time for women to take a stand and reclaim what is ours.
  6584	It's time to take back the night. 
  6585	 
  6586	Announcer: This has been a service message from the
  6587		Pro-feminist anime-girl movement.

  6589	<Commercial 2>
  6590	
  6591	[ We see Ranma being attacked by Kunou, Ryouga, Mousse and Happosai ]
  6592	
  6593	Ranma:	Can't fight them all...
  6594	Others:	Hahahaha!
  6595		This is the end for you Ranma!
  6596		You can't win!
  6597	Ranma:	Too weak.. I need more energy.
  6598	
  6599	[ Suddenly Shampoo rides in, lands on top of all four of Ranma's opponents ]
  6600	
  6601	Shampoo: Nihao!
  6602	Ranma:	Shampoo!
  6603	Shampoo: You skipped breakfast again didn't you?
  6604	Ranma:	Well, I didn't have any time, too many challenges.	
  6605	Shampoo: You only need 5 minutes to enjoy a quick nutricious breakfast.
  6606		[ holds out a bowl ]
  6607	Ranma:	Ranma 1/2 cereal!
  6608		[ Shampoo pours milk into the bowl of cereal ]
  6609		And look!  It's changing color with milk!
  6610	Shampoo: The cold milk turns chocolately delicious!
  6611		And the rice flakes, half one side is corn and the other half grain
  6612		to give you a double taste of nutricious goodness!
  6613	Ranma:	Mmmm!  It's good!
  6614	
  6615	Others:	Ranma!  We challenge you!
  6616		[ The others have recovered from Shampoo's crash landing ]
  6617

  6675		In the main ESPolice headquaters, Doctor Kno was assessing the
  6676	circumstances.  Well, he thought.  With Captain Zen away on assignment it
  6677	was up to him to regulate the everyday business at the office.  The first
  6678	thing he did was give himself a raise, open a new research facility and
  6679	fire or transfer half of Zen's staff, the ones he didn't get along with,
  6680	and smoke Zen's private stash of cigars, almost entirely in that order.
  6681	Ah, what a shame it couldn't last forever.
  6682		Decisions, decisions, he thought, as he reviewed the staff roster.
  6683	He was currently reviewing the file of a Dr. Kishida.  Brilliant man but
  6684	he's been a little unstable since the death of his young wife.  But he was
  6685	Brilliant.  He was one of the main scientists working on the EPSILON unit,
  6686	before Zen's hasty activation turned the entire operation into scrap
  6687	metal.  Kishada had already drawn up plans for the next mecha, but they
  6688	were, to say the least, a bit non-standard.  And the man was always
  6689	talking about the threat of invasions from space aliens.  His aid told him
  6690	that he was fooling around with new expirmental weapons, and using them.
  6691	Oh well, he'll just transfer him to that Science Chemical Electronics
  6692	division.  It was a relatively small unimportant sub-division where he
  6693	could still do off the wall research until he felt he was competant to
  6694	return. 
  6695		But he had more important things to take care of.  Dr. Kno was
  6696	researching the city in which Captain Zen and agents Aih and Kay were
  6697	assigned to. The odd thing was no communications could reach the city.  Be
  6698	it by telephone, fax, satellite linkup, postal system, electronic mail or
  6699	carrier pigeon.  When he updated this new information into the database,
  6700	he just noticed that another city had the same characteristics about a
  6701	week ago.  Out of curiosity he skimmed through the records.  Sure enough
  6702	another city had the same conditions.  He wasn't sure, but he had a bad
  6703	feeling something bigger than anyone thought was occuring.  He quickly
  6704	paged his aid and ordered her to make a complete search and give him a
  6705	report by the afternoon.
  6706

  6708	
  6709	[ Cut to another room.  Sounds of a roaring fire being eminate from the room.  
  6710	  Next the clanging of metal against metal.  Voices whisper to and fro ]
  6711	
  6712	Akane:	Sister!  I hardly think this is the proper time for cooking.
  6713	Kasumi:	Nonsense, Akane.  We've been Wandering around these halls
  6714		for some time now.  You must be getting tired and hungry.
  6715	Akane:	[ thinking ] Well actually , I am a little...
  6716	Kasumi:	Besides it will help take your mind off your problems...
  6717	Akane:	Sister...
  6718	
  6719	Kasumi:	Let's see.. Hmm it seems they have everything I need to cook..
  6720		Rice, Ground Beef, Peas, Beans, Eggs, Onions, Carrots...
  6721	
  6722	Akane:	[ thinking ]
  6723		I don't know what's going on anymore.
  6724		First we've been kidnapped and then the whole city seems to have
  6725		gone crazy.  Everyone I've seen seems to be in some sort of daze.
  6726		We escape from some sort of prison cell and end up Wandering aound
  6727		in some sort of basement.  I don't even know what our captors want.
  6728		Something big is happening, If I only knew what.
  6729	
  6730	Kasumi:	My doesn't this smell good?
  6731		Akane, please be a dear and pass me the pepper.
  6732	Akane:	Pepper?  Okay...
  6733		[ thinking ] Let's see, it's got to be the thing in black...
  6734	
  6735	[ Akane fumbles around for a while trying to desperately find the
  6736	  Ground Pepper.  Finally she settles for a jar of soy sauce.. ]
  6737	
  6738	Akane:	Close enough...
  6739	
  6740	[ Then someone hands her a pepper shaker ]
  6741	
  6742	Akane:	Oh!  Thanks Ranma...RANMA?!
  6743	
  6744	[ Ranma stands before her.  ]
  6745	
  6746	Ranma:	We've been looking for you two for a long time now...
  6747	
  6748	Akane:	Ranma?!  What took you so long to find us?
  6749		Where have you been...
  6750	
  6751	[ Akane notices something seems different about him.
  6752	  The way he looks, the way he stands, even the way he's firmly grasping
  6753	  the pepper shaker, as if he's trying to choke the life out of it. ]
  6754	  And then she notices the Dark Glasses he's wearing.  She flashbacks to
  6755	  the time when she was fighting Kunou that night she was captured.
  6756	  He too was wearing Dark Glasses. ]
  6757	
  6758	Ranma:	You should have stayed in your cell, now you must pay the price..
  6759	Akane:	Ranma, not you too?..
  6760	
  6761	Kasumi:	Oh, Ranma!  You're just in time for dinner!
  6762	
  6763			*		*		*
  6764	Commander: So tell me again... we were never in danger of conflict
  6765		with the Wandering One?
  6766	Purple:	Yes.  The signals I was sensing were being given off by these.
  6767	
  6768	[ PurpleCoat points to a nearby table.  On it are the shiny chain,
  6769	  a circular shield and an arrow. ]
  6770	
  6771		The Shield was set on top of this Bamboo Umbrella.  I'm guessing
  6772		that's what enhanced the kid's power leveln.  A search of his
  6773		backback revealed an arrow with similar properties.
  6774	
  6775	Taihen:	So what exactly are these things?
  6776	
  6777	Purple:	I believe they are ancient magical artifacts from an ancient war.
  6778		They give off an unusual energy reading which confused my mystic
  6779		senses.  I mistakened them for power traces of the Wandering One.
  6780		All the times that we almost had an encounter with the Wanderer,
  6781		it was actually just some bystander who possessed one of the pieces.
  6782	
  6783	Green:	But why do they give off similar readings?
  6784	
  6785	Purple:	It very may be possible these relics were actually once weilded by
  6786		the Wandering One or by his comrades during the	Holy Wars.
  6787		Most likely someone just stumbled upon some of these artifacts.
  6788	
  6789	Commander: Where is the one known as Ryouga?
  6790	Green:	He's being indoctrinated with Soun Tendo.
  6791		Soun Tendo was just a hypnotized Zombie, we didn't have time
  6792		to transform him into a Dark Slave just yet.
  6793	Purple:	I'm very curious as to where he acquired these weapons.
  6794		If there are any more out there, I'll know.
  6795	Green:	This guy, Hibiki Ryouga, has great potential to be our ultimate
  6796		Dark Slave killing machine.  He's very strong, extremely resourceful
  6797		in various weapons, and most importantly: emotionally unstable.
  6798	Purple:	And we still have the prisoners: Tofu, Lotion, Tendos Akane and
  6799		Kasumi to oversee.
  6800	
  6801	Commander: Things are finally locking into place.
  6802		The resistance has been crushed and the city is an open market ripe
  6803		for our takeover.  Any who may have stood in our way has been
  6804		neutralized. The Wanderer is no longer a threat, the renegade has
  6805		been dealt with and our army of Dark Slaves is one of the most
  6806		powerfullest formed.  All hail the Empire!
  6807	
  6808	Green:	Alright!  Let's celebrate!  <POP!> <POP!>
  6809		[ He lets out some party favors and covers everyone in ribbons ]
  6810	
  6811	Purple:	Ahem.. There's still some other business to take care of.
  6812	Commander: Yes?
  6813	Purple:	Yes, I wanted to talk to you about Kuonji Ukyou's body.
  6814	Commander: What about it?
  6815	Purple:	After the Dark-Slave, Kodachi, nearly killed her, we tried
  6816		to stabalize her condition by putting her in the healing tanks.
  6817	Commander: Yes, I remember giving the order.  How goes her treatment?
  6818	Taihen:	Very badly, she won't last the night.
  6819	Purple:	However, there was some tissue regeneration.
  6820		Upon close obeservation we noticed something.
  6821	Commander: And that is..?
  6822	Purple:	That the person in the healing tank is NOT Kuonji Ukyou.
  6823	Green:	WH-AT?!
  6824	Taihen:	Are you sure?!
  6825	Purple:	Yes, for one thing, the body is that of a Male.
  6826	Commander: Then she's still out there.
  6827	Green:	Big deal, she's just one lonesome girl.  How much harm can she do?
  6828		She's probably hiding and crying her eyes out somewhere.
  6829	
  6830	Gosunkugi: If I may, Commander.
  6831	Commander: Yes?
  6832	Gosunkugi: The Dark Slaves who initially encountered Hibiki Ryouga have
  6833		reported that Kuonji Ukyou accompanied Hibiki in the assault.
  6834	Purple:	So where is she?
  6835	Gos:	The Dark-Slaves report that unfortunately, she was slain during
  6836		the conflict.
  6837	Green:	The Boss is not going to be happy to hear that.
  6838	Commander: Her body was one of the personal selections we were not to harm.
  6839	Purple:	Well, if we rush her to the Healing Tanks perhaps we can
  6840		still salvage the body, if not the person.
  6841	Gos:	It's not that simple.
  6842	Commander: Explain.
  6843	Gos:	Well, umm... When we sent a crew to clean up,
  6844		her body was no where to be found.
  6845		They only found her Spatula struck into the ground and
  6846		four unconscious Dark-Slaves.
  6847	Purple:	Another lost corpse...Great.

  6854	Well since everyone seems to be doing these, so will I.
  6855	Character profile:	PurpleCoat
  6856	
  6857		PurpleCoat is a top notch officer in the Fang Vampire Heirarchy.
  6858	He is a very good leader and an excellent administrator or a field
  6859	commander in battle.  PurpleCoat is sort of like the ultimate first officer
  6860	to a Captain.  Sometimes he's the only thing keeping the conquest system
  6861	flowing smoothly.  His close partner is GreenCoat, a relationship he's not
  6862	too happy about but is stuck with.  He somewhat of a perfectionist and is
  6863	highly contemptuous of his comrade's unprofessionalism.  He has an old
  6864	grudge against FireWater, their exact relationship and events of their
  6865	falling out are unknown.
  6866	
  6867	Nicknames:
  6868		He is called "Purple" by GreenCoat and "PC" by FireWater.
  6869	
  6870	Physical Description:
  6871		PurpleCoat is an imposing tall man wearing a dress shirt with a
  6872	purple tie in a purple suit, with a long purple overcoat, with cute little
  6873	purple buttons (well, you get the idea.)  His head is entirely convered by
  6874	a purple hat which also shadows his eyes.  He sort of looks like a '50s
  6875	gangster.  Oddly enough he has purple fingernails.
  6876	
  6877	Abilities:
  6878		PurpleCoat is very old and experienced vampire.  Being such, we can
  6879	only assume he has the standard vampire abilities heightened up to a level
  6880	befitting him.  His main specialties seem to be great strength, high
  6881	martial arts ability (he's had a lot of practice) and a keen mystical extra
  6882	sensory perception.  His main combat weapons seem to be his fingernails
  6883	which he can extend at will and are strong enough to shred through metal.

  6912	The story so Far
  6913		A short Time Ago In A gallery deep deep below...
  6914		(So I'm getting lazy...)
  6915	
  6916		Tendo Akane and Kasumi are the last hope against the onslaught
  6917	of The Fang, who have either enslaved, captured or killed all others who
  6918	could have aided them in  their struggle.  Taking a break, they two of them
  6919	have retreated to a kitchen in the basement and started cooking dinner.  No
  6920	sooner then it was ready, they were discovered by Ranma, wearing Dark
  6921	Glasses, the tell-tale sign of a Fang Dark-Slave... 
  6922	-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
  6923	
  6924	Akane:	Ranma!
  6925	Ranma:	Quiet!  You will come quietly. [ grasps her arm ]
  6926	Akane:	You're hurting me...
  6927	Ranma:	Do you surrender, girl?!
  6928	Akane:	Let go! [ she swings a punch at him but Ranma catches easily.. ]
  6929		Argh!	[ ..and squeezes HARD ]
  6930	Ranma:	Heh, you weak girl. 
  6931	Akane:	My shoulder still hurts...+
  6932	
  6933	Kasumi:	Dinner will be ready, you two!
  6934	
  6935	Akane:	[ in pain and in tears ] Ranma, why are you doing this?
  6936	Ranma:	You will soon know what it means to serve the Fang empire
  6937		with all your heart. [ about to strike her with a closed fist! ]
  6938	Akane:	RANMA!
  6939	
  6940	Kasumi:	Oh, we have a dinner guest.
  6941	Person:	Miss, are you alright?
  6942	
  6943	[ A stranger, about five feet tall, wearing a standard military Fang uniform
  6944	  similar to Ranma's and and helmet which is covering his entire head.
  6945	  He's standing on top of Ranma, who is apparently unconscious ] 
  6946	
  6947	Akane:	Who are you?  That.. uniform you're wearing...
  6948		Aren't you a little short to be a Fang Trooper?
  6949	Person:	...
  6950		Excuse me, I'll just find some one else to rescue.
  6951	Akane:	No no!  I'm sorry.  Please help me.  Help Ranma...
  6952	Person:	I gave him a hit that should keep him unconscious for a while.
  6953		Be careful.  He's been brainwashed to serve the Fang.
  6954	Akane:	And what about you?
  6955	Person:	This uniform?  I'm not sure how I came to wear it..
  6956		My memories are a little blurry..
  6957		All I know is that I must stop the Fang at all costs.
  6958	Akane:	The Fang?  Ranma was talking about them...
  6959	Person: They're a conquest group of mystic vampires.
  6960	Akane:	What is your name?
  6961	Person:	My name...?
  6962	Akane:	The thing we call you by.
  6963	Person:	You can call me... (struggling) ... Tsu, call me Tsu.
  6964	Akane:	Well, I suppose that's better than "Hey you!"
  6965	Kasumi:	Pleased to meet you Tsu-san.
  6966	Akane:	[ thinking ] This person, the voice is muffled by the
  6967		helmet, but something about it...
  6968	Kasumi:	Oh look.  More dinner guests.
  6969	
  6970	[ From out of the hall way, an army of zombies are forming ]
  6971	
  6972	Tsu:	I think they're on to us.
  6973	Akane:	But how did they find us?
  6974	Tsu:	Probably the same way Ranma and I did.
  6975		I smelled something good and followed my nose.
  6976	Kasumi:	Thank you.
  6977	Tsu:	Everyone knows any member of the Fang can't cook even
  6978		if their life depended on it.
  6979		What an amatuer show...
  6980	Akane:	Never mind that now, they're advancing!
  6981	Kasumi:	Oh look, arrows.
  6982	Akane:	Take cover!
  6983	
  6984	Tsu:	Don't worry.  They're only zombies.. they couldn't hit the
  6985		broad side of a.. ARGGHH!
  6986		[ An arrow strikes Tsu's left arm ]
  6987	
  6988	Mousse:	Surrender! [ draws another arrow in his crossbow ]
  6989	Akane:	Mousse...
  6990	
  6991	Tsu:	Blast... another Dark Slave... and he seems to know what he's doing.
  6992	Akane:	They stopped firing.  Look some zombies are advancing...
  6993	
  6994	Tsu:	I'll stop them! [ concentrates deeply ]
  6995		ARGGHH!  [ gasps in pain ]
  6996		Blast, I haven't recovered as much as I hoped...
  6997		[ rips out the arrow in his arm, along with some flesh ]
  6998		OW!!!  That was a pretty stupid thing to do..
  6999	
  7000	Akane:	Some rescue!
  7001		[ She charges into the zombies and knocks the stuffing out of them.
  7002		She then quickly grabs a bow and some arrows one of the zombies
  7003		were carrying and provides some	cover fire ]
  7004		Think of something!  I'm running out of arrows!
  7005	
  7006	Kasumi:	Well if they're so hungry, they can have the first serving.
  7007		[ She tosses some food at the zombie horde.
  7008		Immediately they start fighting over the food. ]
  7009		My, what hearty appetites!
  7010	
  7011	Mousse:	You fools!  Get out of the way!
  7012	
  7013	Tsu:	Good work!  These zombies are half starved!
  7014	Akane:	It won't hold them forever, we better get out of here.
  7015	Tsu:	This kitchen only has one exit.
  7016	Kasumi:	We better clean up before we leave.
  7017		Akane be a dear and throw out the garbage.
  7018	Tsu:	Garbage.. That's it!  The Garbage chute!
  7019	Akane:	Are you crazy?!  That's goes to the garbage..
  7020	Tsu:	I don't care.  It's either that or facing them.
  7021	Akane:	But...
  7022	Tsu:	Move it!

  7027	PurpleCoat:	About those two prisoners...
  7028	Commander: 	Yes?
  7029	PurpleCoat:	I was thinking, concerning our losses and
  7030			from what I've seen of the girl, 
  7031			I think she'll make an excellent substitute selection..
  7032	Commander:	Yes, she might at that...  Very well. 
  7033			What about the other one, Tofu, is it?
  7034	PurpleCoat:	He's an interesting case.  He is very strong, has
  7035			a deep knowledge of nerve combat and human physiology,
  7036			as well as incredible mental discipline.
  7037	Commander:	He's that good?
  7038	PurpleCoat:	That and more.  His knowledge of the occult is even enough
  7039			to make him a serious threat.
  7040	Commander:	So what do you plan to do with him?
  7041	PurpleCoat:	Why, kill him.  He's just too dangerous to let live.

  7051	Kasumi: This place is certainly dirty.
  7052		[ attempts to wipe the walls with a clean hankerchief ]
  7053	Akane:	Where are we?
  7054	Tsu:	The Trash heap.  Count your blessings,
  7055		at least it wasn't the incinerator.  How's Sleeping Beauty?
  7056	Kasumi:	I'm not tired.  But Ranma is resting comfortably.
  7057	Akane:	Let's get out of here.
  7058	Tsu:	No.  
  7059	Akane:	No?!
  7060	Tsu:	Look, this is the first time we've gotten a peaceful break.
  7061		I don't know about you, but I still have no idea what exactly
  7062		going on.  We have a chance to actually make a plan.
  7063		Let's not blow it, Okay?
  7064	Akane:	Why should we trust you?  We still don't know who you really are.
  7065	Tsu:	All the more reason to settle down and reason things out.
  7066		How do I know if I can trust you?
  7067		Let's make an effort to act instead of react.
  7068	
  7069	Akane:	Isn't your wounded arm hurting?
  7070	Tsu:	Well, now that you mention it, YES!
  7071	Kasumi:	Oh my, the walls are closing in.
  7072	
  7073	Tsu:	Some much for that idea.
  7074	Akane:	Do.. do you think they're on to us?
  7075	Tsu:	Probably not.  I think it's just an automatic setting.
  7076		When a certain amount of garbage gets collected, it gets
  7077		compacted for transportation...

  7080	Akane:	Yes.
  7081	Tsu:	How much do you weigh?
  7082	Akane:	[ furious ] What a thing to ask a girl..!
  7083	Tsu:	Well, I guess it's not important now.
  7084		The trap's already been activated.
  7085	Akane:	KYAAA!
  7086	Tsu:	I hope you're not claustiphobic.
  7087	Akane:	Something.. touched my leg...
  7088	Tsu:	Well, it wasn't me.
  7089	Akane:	No, it was some thing under the sewage..
  7090	Tsu:	What... could it be some sort of predator?
  7091		Maybe they did anticipate some sort of escape maneuver like this.

  7125		If what you told me about Ranma is true, we're going to need his power.
  7126		Besides, Ranma's their newest recruit.  The longer we wait, 
  7127		the harder it will be to break his drug addiction.

  7136		Now try not to move it around too much for about three days.
  7137	Tsu:	THREE DAYS?!  I haven't got that kind of...!
  7138	Kasumi:	Well you did tear open the wound several times while
  7139		exposing it to a highly unsanitary environment.
  7140		And if you're going to keep waving it around like that,
  7141		you better add two more days.
  7142	Tsu:	Okay, Okay.
  7143	Akane:	What did you say about Ranma before?  They have him on drugs?!
  7144	
  7145	Tsu:	Very powerful, mindbending and highly addictive.

  7150		[ Ranma has a deep red hue in his eyes ]
  7151	Tsu:	Definitely the mark of a drug addiction.
  7152		It's already been saturated into his bloodstream.
  7153	Akane:	So what do you plan to do?
  7154	Tsu:	I'm going to deprogram him.  But before I do that I'm have to first
  7155		eliminate the drug factor and break his addiction. 
  7156	Akane:	And how are you going to that?
  7157	Tsu:	By eliminating his Dark polluted Half.
  7158	Akane:	And how are you going to that?
  7159	Tsu:	By cleansing him of the drugs.
  7160	Akane:	And JUST how are you going to that?!

  7166	Gosunkugi:	Not very good, absolutely no leads.
  7167	GreenCoat:	Any theories?
  7168	Gosunkugi:	Sure, maybe she just got up and walked away.
  7169	GreenCoat:	Stupid!  Corpses just don't come back to life...
  7170			Well, it takes them at least a few days to come back at any
  7171			rate.  Besides, if she did, why would she just leave her
  7172			weapon behind?   Blast!  With the rate of vampires increasing
  7173			nightly, it's hard to keep track of them all.
  7174	Gosunkugi:	That is why I'm here, sir.
  7175	GreenCoat:	Yeah, that's right.  I want a comple personel tally. 
  7176			If any vampire has decided to take extra liberties, 
  7177			I wan't to know.  
  7178	Gosunkugi:	Is that really necessary, sir?
  7179	GreenCoat:	Is there any reason why not?
  7180	Gosunkugi:	Well, umm,.. I mean we keep them on a very tight
  7181			discipline and umm.. we feed them well enough...
  7182	GreenCoat:	Yeah, I guess you're right.
  7183			But even so I want that check to be done.
  7184	Gosunkugi:	Yes, chief.
  7185	GreenCoat:	And just in case, I want all Dark Slaves making routine
  7186			patrols.  Report to me immediately if anything comes up.

  7197		a degree in psychology and mental training as well as
  7198		being taught professionally in medicine.
  7199	Akane:	So you went to medical school?
  7200	Tsu:	...Yes.
  7201	Kasumi:	Then you have a medical degree?
  7202	Tsu:	...No.  I remember going, but I think I flunked out.
  7203		It's all still a little jumbled, especially after that hit on the head.
  7204		Hey, don't look like that!  I could have just lied to you!
  7205	Akane:	[ herself ] How do we know you didn't..
  7206	Tsu:	Here goes nothing. <thunk!> <thunk!>
  7207		[ Starts sticking pins into Ranma's body ]
  7208	Akane:	You can say that again.

  7212	
  7213		"Why we stand here?", asked a zombie to his companion.
  7214	"Becase, you walking pile of drool", responded his compainion,
  7215	"We were put on guard duty to prevent any of the Masters's enemies
  7216	 from gaining entry into this chamber", he continued in his haughty manner.
  7217	"Goodness, you zombies are certainly braindead"
  7218		The zombie bit back the harsh response on his lips.  It made no
  7219	sense, even to him, to start a conflict.  After all, the other guard, as a
  7220	vampire, was a lot stronger than he was.  In a sense the vampire was also his
  7221	superior.  But he consoled himself by reminding himself that if his vampire
  7222	companion was so hot, what was he doing on guard duty?
  7223	
  7224	"Remember, we're supposed to be guarding some very important items.", the
  7225	vampire guard continued as if reading the zombie's mind.
  7226	"That's why I'm being put on guard duty with such a lowly *thing* such as
  7227	yourself."
  7228		Blast him!, the zombie thought.  He was always so arrogantly
  7229	annoying.  But wait, he thought he heard some whistling.
  7230	TweeT-TweeT... Tweet-tweet-tweet-tweet-TweeT-TweeT...
  7231	He looked to see if it was his vampire companion. But no, he was too busy
  7232	yapping his mouth off.  It was so easy to get him started but always so
  7233	hard to stop him.  But like it or not, the overstuffed vampire did have a
  7234	point.  As a zombie he always felt so brain dead.  Something about being a
  7235	zombie just made him feel that way.  It was the same with every other
  7236	zombie he knew.  If only he wasn't always so hungry.  There was always a
  7237	ringing in his ears as if there was a buzzsaw cutting through his skull.  He
  7238	was just so hungry all the time.  And his vampire companion thought he was
  7239	such hot stuff just because he got to have his blood drained a few days
  7240	before he did.
  7241		And that was his last thought before darkness overtook him.
  7242	
  7243	"Another thing", the vampire continued.
  7244	"Do you zombies always have to raise such a stench where ever you..
  7245	 Hey!  Are you listening to me..", his voice trailed off as he saw the end
  7246	of a throwing weapon embedded in the zombie's chest.
  7247	
  7248	"Those who fall from the path of the righteous are doomed
  7249	 to Wander lost in purgatory.", a crisp voice rang out from around the
  7250	corner.  The interloper was calmly approaching him, not even bothering to
  7251	muffle the sound of his footsteps closing in. 
  7252	
  7253	"Whoever you are, you won't find me as easy a target as this piece of
  7254	carrion", the vampire warned.
  7255		"I don't expect to.  You'll probably be easier.", the voice mocked.
  7256	The vampire barely even saw what happened next.  The intruder jumped up into
  7257	the air and then landed behind him.  He quickly turned to face his opponent
  7258	before a wave of a garlic breath overtook him.  Gasping and losing
  7259	consciousness, he just made out a long slim hand holding a sharp piece of
  7260	wood.  Then he felt a painful jab enter his chest.
  7261		"May this too solid flesh melt away but let the spirit soar free.
  7262		 Rest in piece."

  7269	Akane:	His pupils are dilating!
  7270	Tsu:	Good, he's not dead yet.  What color are they?
  7271	Akane:	... They're black!  The redness, it's leaving!
  7272	Tsu:	Don't celebrate yet, we're only half finished.
  7273		I just need a moment to rest..
  7274	Kasumi:	Tsu-san, are you alright?
  7275	Tsu:	I'm fine.. it's just all that blood..
  7276		Nevermind, we have to hurry with the next step,	we drained the
  7277		poison from his blood and now we must heal the scars in his mind. 
  7278		We have to undo the damage caused by their deceitful brainwashing.
  7279	Akane:	How are you going to accomplish that?

  7289	Lo-shin: But prison is escape-proof from inside..
  7290		It my fault.  We stuck in because of me...
  7291	Tofu:	Lotion-chan, it wasn't your fault.

  7300		If he keeps moving like that, he's going to lose what little
  7301		blood he has left.

  7307	Ranma:	I'm sorry, Mommy, I did a bad thing... A really bad thing...
  7308		I.. deserve to suffer...
  7309	Kasumi:	Shhh...

  7317	"Alright it's decided then", Aih said.
  7318		"Yup, since it'll be morning anyway, the sunlight will do the job
  7319		for us giving them a peaceful death.  And if they happen to wake up
  7320		before then, the cables should hold them in place until then."
  7321	"Alright, let's go.", the two sped off leaving the currently unconscious
  7322	vampires restrained.  The two ESPolice officers had a bad enough time
  7323	fighting these ghouls, they just didn't have the heat to condemn these poor
  7324	souls and kill them in cold blood, so they left them to the tender mercies
  7325	of Nature.  Soon enough, the merciful sunlight would end these poor
  7326	creatures of darkness's dismal existance.  But death is never a pleasant
  7327	journey, already the night fiends are stirring, fighting off the threat of
  7328	eternal sleep with every ounce of their supernatural strength.
  7329	
  7330		Far above them, farther then even their sensors could see, a large
  7331	mecha was on a decsending course.  Captain Zen was coming in for a landing
  7332	any minute now.  Everything's going smoothly, he thought.  He made a big
  7333	gamble, just closing in on that huge energy spiral he saw earlier.  By his
  7334	usual hunch feeling he even shut off the navigational and geography
  7335	computers.  All he had to do was just maintain his current heading.
  7336		By his clock, it was nearly morning.  And then his sensors picked
  7337	up a large  thrunderstorm brewing.  Great, he thought, not again.  Now he
  7338	would have to compensate his jets for this extra weather factor.  Just then
  7339	his fuel consumption ran out.  He immediately tapped into the emergency
  7340	battery power for a temporary boost only to find out his solar cells were
  7341	nearly exhausted.  Why weren't things ever easy?, he whined.
  7342	
  7343			*		*		*
  7344	Akane:	Well?!
  7345	Tsu:	It's no use.  Ranma hates himself too much.
  7346		I can't break their mental barriers they have around his psyche.
  7347	Akane:	Well try again!
  7348	Tsu:	I have been!  These guys are experts!
  7349		They've been brainwashing warriors for hundreds of years,

  7351		You know, you really have to admire their work..
  7352	
  7353	Akane:	Why is Ranma like this?
  7354	Tsu:	He believes he committed patricide.
  7355	Akane:	But Ranma would never..
  7356	Tsu:	He was pumped up on drugs, remember?
  7357	Akane:	...
  7358		So what are we going to do?
  7359	Tsu:	He needs to somehow seperate himself and his crime.
  7360		If we can just force some sort of detatchment between himself
  7361		and the actual event, we have a chance of appealing to him.
  7362		It's very dangerous, almost like forcing a split-personality.
  7363		Sort of like blaming everything on your imaginary friend.
  7364		His better half must somehow come through.

  7435		Besides, if Ranko can't even survive a punch to the face,
  7436		there's no way she'll survive a confrontation with the Fang.
  7437	Kasumi:	Oh Akane, you've given Ranko-chan a black eye.
  7438		And her eye, it's swelling red.
  7439	Akane:	...
  7440			*		*		*
  7441	
  7442		The stranger stood open in front of the chamber doors.
  7443	"Hmf.  They thought to seal the room with mystic wards and seals.
  7444	 But these won't stop me.", the interloper reached out and calmy tore down
  7445	the seals.  The door wasn't even locked. 
  7446	"What an amateur show", the intruder pushed open the door and stepped in
  7447	to claim the treasure.
  7448	
  7449			*		*		*
  7450	
  7451	[ Tsu is intently watching the main hall ]
  7452	
  7453	Akane:	Oh, Tsu.  You're here.  I was wondering where you disappeared off to.
  7454	Tsu:	[ ignoring her ]  Those energy manifistations...
  7455		They're planning something big, like a major teleportation.
  7456	Akane:	Do you think.. Ranko will be up to an encounter so soon?
  7457	Tsu:	Hmm?  Oh Ranko, well he.. She better be.  I set up some psychic
  7458		barriers in her mind, to her Saotome Ranma is a completely seperate
  7459		entity.  But her personality is still her own unique one.
  7460	Akane:	A tom boy.
  7461	Tsu:	...Yes.  But she should still be able to use all the techniques she
  7462		learned as a man, although she may be a bit hesistant or unsure
  7463		about them. 
  7464	
  7465	[ Tsu stands up and looks away from the viewers.  After Tsu takes off the
  7466	  broken helmet, long flowing light brown hair cascades down to the
  7467	  shoulders.  Tsu then ties a pair of thick  goggles around where the hemet
  7468	  used to be. ] 
  7469	
  7470		We better get ready.  This is going to be the big one.
  7471	[ Tsu unzips the uniform jacket to reveal a shapely form and starts
  7472	  stretching ]
  7473	
  7474	Akane:	Wait, you're a girl!
  7475	Tsu:	Hmm?  I'm a girl...
  7476	Akane:	It makes sense.. your height.. your build... your voice...
  7477		Why didn't you tell us?!
  7478	Tsu:	I... it didn't seem important at the time.
  7479	Akane:	Who are you?  Why are you helping us fight?
  7480		How do you know so much about the Fang?
  7481	Tsu:	Honestly... I don't know and I don't remember...
  7482		It'll be dawn soon, we better get the others. [ leaves ]
  7483	Akane:	[ thinking ] Wait..  Her voice... something about it..
  7484	
  7485			*		*		*
  7486	Commander:	What was it that GreenCoat reported?
  7487	PurpleCoat:	Apparently someone broke into one of our secruity chambers
  7488			and stole some items. 
  7489	Commander:	Which chamber?
  7490	PurpleCoat:	The one containing the weapon artifacts.
  7491	Commander:	WHAT?!  In the right hands, that person might have
  7492			enough power to challenge..
  7493	PurpleCoat:	Doubtful.  Unless they have the proper mental training,
  7494			it's unlikely they will be able to tap into their full power.
  7495	Commander:	From what you've told me, didn't the girl, Lotion, do
  7496			just that against Taihen?
  7497	PurpleCoat:	Well, those were very, umm, unique conditions.
  7498			Her hatred of Taihen knows no bounds, after all, he was one
  7499			of the major players which destroyed her home village.
  7500			Her intense anger somehow activated the weapon's energies.
  7501	Commander:	Can we utilize this power source?
  7502	PurpleCoat:	Unfortunately, no.  These weapons are considered holy,
  7503			only to be weilded by some righteous boob or a saint,
  7504			same thing.  Just like the Wandering One.
  7505			But even then, to unlock their full power takes
  7506			two lifetimes of intense training.
  7507			To beings such as ourselves, we wouldn't even be able to
  7508			touch them if their true power was awakened.
  7509	Commander:	Then what's the problem?
  7510	PurpleCoat:	It's just that the only two people I know who would have that
  7511			much training are dead.
  7512	Commander:	Then what's the problem?
  7513	PurpleCoat:	One was a being known only as Cologne.
  7514	Commander:	Yes, I remember in the debriefing.  Remarkable skills.
  7515			But didn't she die in that village incident?
  7516	PurpleCoat:	Yes, she was too dangerous to the plan.  In fact, the whole
  7517			ruse was set up mainly to lead her away from this target
  7518			site.  I'm suprised that she was actually killed.
  7519	Commander:	What about that other one... similar to her...
  7520	PurpleCoat:	Happosai?  He certainly has power but I hardly think he
  7521			has the necessary discipline.
  7522	Commander:	True.  Like Cologne, he could have been a serious
  7523			interference to the plan.  Is he still imprisoned in the
  7524			north sector in the cavern wall?
  7525	PurpleCoat:	Yes.  Despite his weaknesses, he's still too powerful to
  7526			convert into a Dark-Slave.  Besides, we need him alive to
  7527			bargin with the winged Demon in China.
  7528	Commander:	The same one who played the pivotal role in the Village Wars?
  7529	PurpleCoat:	The same.  But concering the original topic, the other
  7530			one I was thinking about was FireWater. 
  7531	Commander:	He's dead.  GreenCoat killed him.
  7532	PurpleCoat:	Perhaps..  But even so, he's too tainted.  Even his
  7533			goody-goody motives aren't enough to overcome his failings..
  7534	Commander:	Then what's the problem?
  7535	PurpleCoat:	There was another item in that chambers, and it was also
  7536			taken.
  7537			[ Dramatic pause as he slowly looks away ]
  7538			FireWater's faceplate.

  7544		
  7545	Character Profile:	Taihen
  7546		Taihen is basically a field operator for the Fang.  Other than
  7547	having above average power levels for a vampire and mastering all the
  7548	abilities of a vampire, he is nothing realy special.  Like GreenCoat, he
  7549	sometimes prefers enjoying himself than doing his assignment.  He seems to
  7550	be go way back with GreenCoat and PurpleCoat.  Although PurpleCoat is at
  7551	times contemptous at his lack of discipline, Taihen is good friends with
  7552	GreenCoat.
  7553		The most notable characteristic for Taihen is his love of girls.
  7554	This passion is no where near the level of Ataru Moboroshi or Ryo Saeba,
  7555	but it's close.  He is sort of like Mendo, just a little bit more dignified
  7556	and arrogant about it.  But he's still a pervert and sex maniac.  Although
  7557	he WILL resort to brute force to have his way, his superiors usually keep
  7558	him on a short leash since it usually turns out to be detrimental to the
  7559	current assignment.  
  7560	
  7561	Physical Description:
  7562		An okay looking Japanese guy usually wearing a black sports jacket
  7563	and constantly combing his hair.  Near anime equivalences could be a grown
  7564	up Mendo from Urusei Yatsura or the tennis coach, Mitaka from Maison Ikkoku.

  7590				   FAN FICTION
  7591	
  7592				PART 10
  7593	
  7594	The Story so far:
  7595		In the struggle to against the Fang domination over the city,
  7596	Tendo Akane, Kasumi are aided by an unknown stranger, Tsu.  She turned out
  7597	to be highly secretive, her true motive, past, and face unknown.  She
  7598	claimed that somehow her own memory has been befuddled.  Together they
  7599	escaped capture by the Fang forces with their own captive, Ranma.  With the
  7600	help of Tsu's apparent basic hypnotic skills, they have bypassed Ranma's
  7601	brainwashing.  Freed from the spell of being a Dark-Slave, Ranma is now in
  7602	a more subtle imprisonment as he now believes himself to be Tendo Ranko,
  7603	Akane's cousin, yet he is now driven to fight the Fang.
  7604		The Fang on their part are highly confident of their victory.  They
  7605	believe all their enemies either slain or captured.  They have become
  7606	careless and ripe for conquest.  Small incidents have  been adding up to
  7607	cause potential disaster for them.  First a few bodies turn up missing,
  7608	then some prisoners escape, and finally ancient weapons of power have been
  7609	stolen from their vaults.  The fall is coming...

  7613	[ In some a workshop, we see Nabiki working on some table.
  7614	  She is wearing one of those jeweler's eyepieces and cutting some
  7615	  diamonds ]
  7616	
  7617	Taihen:	Hello, beautiful.
  7618	Nabiki:	Oh, you.  What do you want?
  7619	Taihen:	Only to gaze upon your lovliness.
  7620	Nabiki:	Look, I'm really busy right now.  I have to finish these diamond
  7621		edged roller blades for the Golden Pair.
  7622	Taihen:	You know, you're father must be a thief.
  7623	Nabiki:	Eh?!  Thief...?!
  7624	Taihen:	How else could you get those diamonds in your eyes?
  7625	Nabiki:	Oh.  Actually, GreenCoat just robbed a jewelry store for me.
  7626	Taihen:	C'mon.  How about we go out together.
  7627		Have a romantic dinner, play soothing music..
  7628	Nabiki:	Sorry, but your idea of a meal and my idea of a meal 
  7629		kind of conflicts.
  7630	Taihen:	Don't you think I'm handsome?
  7631	Nabiki:	No.
  7632	Taihen:	C'mon, just look me in the eye and tell me again.
  7633	NAbiki:	If you're trying to use your mind-control powers on me, it won't work.
  7634		First of all, I have a mind.  Second, I have this pendent.
  7635		[ she shows off a SILVER necklace ]
  7636	Taihen:	How..How did you get silver in here?!
  7637	Nabiki:	I convinced PurpleCoat to let me keep it.
  7638		For my own protection... against you.
  7639		He agreed immediately when I mentioned that point.
  7640	Taihen:	[ a bit ruffled ] Fine.
  7641		The commander sent me to check up on the Regenerative Tanks anyway.
  7642	Nabiki:	No!
  7643	Taihen:	Eh?  Why not?
  7644	Nabiki:	I don't want any one to disturb my work..
  7645		The Golden Pair are at a very impressionable stage at this moment.
  7646		I need to to fit to their exact specifications.
  7647		You might disrupt my measurements...
  7648	Taihen:	I don't know..
  7649	Nabiki:	[ smiles very sensually and drapes her hand over his chest ]
  7650		Please?
  7651	Taihen:	Well...Okay...
  7652	Nabiki:	Good, now if you'll excuse me, I have get back to work.
  7653		[ turns her back on him and picks up a thin wire ]
  7654	Taihen:	....

  7656	
  7657	[ At a certain battle site, GreenCoat is lingering around a Spatula stuck
  7658	  into the ground, the last site of the body of Kuoji Ukyou. ]
  7659	
  7660	GreenCoat:	Why am I stuck with all these stupid little problems?
  7661	
  7662	PurpleCoat [ flashback ]:
  7663		So you want to play Security Chief?  Good..
  7664	
  7665	GreenCoat (present):
  7666		Hmm [ starts to pull out the spatula ]
  7667		Oof!  Sheesh, this guy is strong! [ drops the overgrown utensil ]
  7668		This investigation is going no where.
  7669		Ah, idea!
  7670	[ hits the palm of one hand with the bottom of his other hand's fist ]
  7671		I should have done this before.
  7672	
  7673	[ GreenCoat shimmers a bit and then grotesquely starts transforming into
  7674	  a hairy wolf.  He starts sniffing around the area.  Suddenly his
  7675	  eyes glow with a certain revelation. ]
  7676	
  7677	PurpleCoat's Mental Voice:
  7678		Green!  Green!  There's an attack by the north wall.
  7679		Report there immediately.
  7680	
  7681	GreenCoat:	[ back to "human" form ]  Eh?
  7682			Command recieved, changing course.  Bearing 2-3-5, mark.
  7683			Warp 5.  ETA:...
  7684	
  7685	PurpleCoat:	Just get there!!
  7686	GreenCoat:	Acknowledged.  GreenCoat out.
  7687	
  7688	[ Summoning his energy, GreenCoat starts floating in the air and then picks
  7689	  up speed and flies down the cavern.  When he leaves, a figure comes out
  7690	  of the shadow and stares at his disappearing form.  He bends down and
  7691	  fingers the Spatula. ]
  7692	
  7693	Stranger:	"A warrior's life and a warrior's death.
  7694			What more can one ask for, save honor and love's breath"
  7695			Rest in piece.
  7696	
  7697	[ Like GreenCoat, the stranger leaves, disappearring silently into the
  7698	  shadows. ]

  7701	
  7702	[ In their prison cell, Tofu-sensei is examining the door ]
  7703	Tofu:	I think it is time for us to make our depature..
  7704	Lo-shin: But how we get out?  Door too strong from inside.
  7705	Tofu:	The door, it's unlocked. [ opens it ]
  7706	Lo-shin: But...
  7707	Tofu:	[ staring at some scratch marks on the handle ]
  7708		Someone picked it open.
  7709	Lo-shin: But who?
  7710	Tofu:	I'm more concerned over where the guards are.
  7711	
  7712			*		*		*
  7713	
  7714	[ In another large chamber, the conflict between Ranma's group and some
  7715	  Fang troopers is raging.  ]
  7716	  
  7717	Tsu:	Akane!  Protect Kasumi!
  7718		Ranko, take care of the zombies..
  7719		I'll take this braggart!
  7720	
  7721	Kunou:	You cannot defeat the power of Dark-Kunou!
  7722	
  7723	[ This time, all the zombies are armed with weapons.
  7724	  Akane does her best to keep them at bay while Ranma-chan is dancing
  7725	  around them.  Tsu tries to attack Kunou but.. ]
  7726	
  7727	Kunou:	Strike!  Strike!  Strike!  Strike!  Strike!  Strike!  
  7728	
  7729	[ Kunou's quick sword thrust attack knocks Tsu ten feet away! ]
  7730	
  7731	R-chan:	Kunou!  I challenge you!
  7732	Kunou:	Strike!  Strike!  Strike!  Strike!  Strike!  Strike!  
  7733	R-chan: Crackling-Fire-Speed-Fist! [ Gives off super fast punches ]
  7734		
  7735	[ The two of them  go at it for several seconds, each attack
  7736	  being countered by the other.  But then Ranma-chan falters
  7737	  and Kunou gets in a painful jab ]
  7738	
  7739	R-chan:	Too weak..
  7740	Kunou:	Little pony-tailed girl, you're no match for a real man!
  7741	R-chan:	I'm a...!  ..girl? [ looking at herself ]
  7742	Tsu:	Ranko, no!  You still haven't recovered enough. (as if I did...)
  7743		There's got to be a way to slow down his attack..
  7744	
  7745	[ Tsu spies something at the far wall, she immediately runs towards it.
  7746	  A zombie with a sword tries to intercept her, but Tsu graps his neck and
  7747	  snaps it in an awkward angle.  Tsu graps his sword and advances. ]
  7748	
  7749	Kunou:	No one can stop the power of Dark-Kunou!
  7750	Voice:	Wanna bet?!
  7751	
  7752	[ A cabinet flies towards him.  Kunou uses his fast-thrust attack on it,
  7753	  but the cabinet is made of steel and blunts his attacks.
  7754	  When the cabinet reaches him, Tsu leaps out and cuts him with a swipe
  7755	  of her sword. ]
  7756	
  7757	Kunou:	Feh, this little cut doesn't bother me at all!
  7758	Tsu:	Let's see how well you handle a fair fight!
  7759		Swordsman to Swordsman!
  7760	
  7761	[ They thrust and block for a couple of rounds.  After a few minutes they
  7762	  both back off, tired and sweating.  Then without warning the two charge.
  7763	  The two move as one, each brandishing their swords.
  7764	  Finally they meet and cross.  This time neither goes to parry
  7765	  but go on the offensive.  Both strike flesh and score fatal blows. ]
  7766	
  7767	Kunou:	Strike!
  7768	Tsu:	ARG!  My ribs..
  7769	
  7770	[ The only difference is, Kunou's sword is wooden, Tsu's isn't. ]
  7771	
  7772	Kunou:	UGHG!! [ blood gushes out of his mouth as well as his wound ]
  7773	Akane:	Kunou-sempai...!
  7774	
  7775	[ With the defeat of their Dark-slave leader, the rest of the zombies, who
  7776	  are still conscious, retreat. ]
  7777	
  7778	Kasumi:	Tsu!  Are you alright?
  7779	Tsu:	I'm fine, just a little hit..
  7780	
  7781	Kasumi:	No you're not.  I've seen enough injuries to know,
  7782		you're ribs aren't just bruised, they're broken!
  7783		[ She tears off a piece of cloth from her dress and wraps it around
  7784		Tsu's side. ] 
  7785		There, this should hold them in place.
  7786	Tsu:	Thank you..
  7787	
  7788	Ranma-chan: Kunou..?
  7789	Akane:	You didn't have to do that!
  7790	Tsu:	Yes, I did.
  7791	Kunou:	Tendo Akane... Pony-tailed girl...
  7792		Please...Before I die, I want to tell you...
  7793		[ Akane and Ranma-chan lean over ]
  7794	
  7795		That I always....HATED you!
  7796		[ starts strangling them both ]
  7797		How long have you two always scorned my love?!
  7798		How long have I been betrayed by your flirtatious...
  7799		UGH..!
  7800	Akane:	Gasp!  Cough Cough...
  7801	R-chan:	What was that?
  7802	Tsu:	That was his death rattle.  It's over.
  7803		He won't bother you any more.  I always hit my target.
  7804	R-chan:	Kunou...
  7805	Akane:	You mean, he's dead...?
  7806		[ The two just look at his body, silently ]
  7807	Tsu:	From the way you two talked about him I would think you would
  7808		be dancing a jig.
  7809	Akane:	He's dead!  Don't you realize how precious life is?
  7810		All life?!  This isn't just some game where we score points..
  7811		He was an innocent!  He didn't deserve to die...
  7812		[She starts crying, her tears dropping onto Kunou ]
  7813	
  7814	VOICE:	AW!  NOW ISN'T THIS SOOOOO SAD!
  7815	[ The voice seems to fill the entire cavern.  Everyone looks around
  7816	  but can't see the source. ]
  7817	
  7818	Voice:	Looking for me?  Here I am!
  7819		[ Suddenly Ranma-chan keels over as if struck ]
  7820		Hahaha!  You fools don't have a chance!
  7821	
  7822	Tsu:	There! [ she jump kicks something to Kasumi's right ]
  7823	
  7824	Green:	Oof!  Hey you're pretty good.
  7825		[ He fades into sight ]
  7826		I could probably still fight you with my cloak field on
  7827		but that's no fun.
  7828	Tsu:	Fang scum!  Your invisibility tricks won't save you from me!
  7829	Green:	Hey, you look familar.
  7830	R-chan:	You're arrogant enough to take on all of us?
  7831		We'll pound the crap out of you!
  7832	Green:	Against four cream puffs like you?  No problem.
  7833		Hey, you look familar too...
  7834	Akane:	[ wiping the tears from her face ] Face your opponents!
  7835	Green:	Talk is cheap.   Well, what are you waiting for?
  7836		Aren't you going to attack me?
  7837		(God, I just love my lines!)
  7838	[ Everyone except Kasumi leap towards him.  But Green lights up	like a

  7843		Gosunkugi was upset.  Everything was falling apart and as the
  7844	middleman he was getting all the heat.  But it shouldn't be this way!, he
  7845	thought.  As a Fang Officer he thought he was finally in a position of
  7846	respect.  His master, GreenCoat entrusted in very important
  7847	responsibilities.  The first real ones any one has ever given him.  He was
  7848	not going to let him down.  Right now he was a winner and he was going to
  7849	stay that way.  He already had a hard life of being the clown and the butt
  7850	of every one's jokes, always being shown up by jocks like Ranma and Kunou.
  7851	No, he would never go back.  He would never go back to being hurt miserable
  7852	and alone.  He would never go back to being weak and always beaten upon.
  7853	Everyone always laughed at him.  Everyone, except Akane.  She was always so
  7854	nice to him.  And now she was a fugitive, wanted by the Fang for most
  7855	likely some dark diabolical plan.  Gosunkugi wasn't sure where his
  7856	loyalties lied anymore.  His thoughts were so jumbled right now.  His mind
  7857	was concentrating with thoughts of lost romance.  So of course he gets
  7858	nailed.
  7859		Before he knew it, some sort of wire spun around his neck.
  7860	Strong hands then grappled him and pulled on the garotte HARD.  Gosunkugi
  7861	tried to yell or scream but the pain and the tightness were too much.  He
  7862	could barely remain conscious.  As hard as he struggled, he couldn't break
  7863	free.  That was pretty impressive considering that now as a vampire,
  7864	Gosunkugi had ten to twenty times his normal strength.  Whoever his captor
  7865	was, he really knew his stuff, he was using his leverage against him.  Even
  7866	though Gosunkugi was a weakling before, a whole legion of weaklings was
  7867	still nothing to scoff at. 
  7868	"I highly advise against engaging in futile resistance.  A more agreeable
  7869	nature would enable you to keep your head", whispered a voice as  he was
  7870	dragged into a private location.  Times like these, Gosunkugi was really
  7871	glad he wasn't a girl. 
  7872	"A loose tongue is abhored save on the lips of the bearer of news", the
  7873	voice said in his ear.  
  7874		"What?!", Gosunkugi let out in some brief gasps of air.
  7875		It sounded like a bad fortune cookie or some lame chinese proverb.
  7876	"I want information", the voice reiterated.
  7877	"And I'm in a bit of a hurry, so if you don't talk you die.  I can pull on
  7878	this so hard, your head will slice clean off.  Understand?"  Gosunkugi
  7879	could just nod. 
  7880	"I want to know where you're keeping a particular prisoner.
  7881	 Where is the one known as, Happosai?"
  7882	
  7883			*		*		*	
  7884	[ Akane, Ranma-chan and Tsu are lying on the ground ]
  7885	
  7886	Tsu:	Just with one blow..
  7887	Akane:	He sent us all flying...
  7888	Kasumi:	My, he's very strong.
  7889	Green:	You've got to be able to do better than that.
  7890	R-chan:	You mean like this?!
  7891		[ concentrating ] Roaring Lion Bullet!
  7892		[ Her power blast knocks GreenCoat agains the wall ]
  7893	Green:	Ow... [ peels himself out ]
  7894		Not bad, for a skirt.
  7895	R-chan:	[ furious ] Roaring Lion Bullet!
  7896		[ this time GreenCoat returns with his power blast and overwhelms
  7897		  Ranma-chan ]
  7898	Green:	Hey, you wanna play Phaser-fight, I'm game.
  7899		But you can't beat me like that, you just don't have the emotional 
  7900		maturity to master that technique.
  7901		You guys aren't much of a challenge.
  7902		Then again, what can I expect from a bunch of girls..
  7903	R-chan:	I'M A ...!
  7904	Tsu:	...GIRL?!
  7905	Akane:	Eh?
  7906	Tsu:	Which part of me is a Girl?!
  7907	Green:	Well, if I was Taihen I would go into a very long detailled explicit...
  7908	Tsu:	Blast you!
  7909		[ Silence falls as Tsu begins humming in concentration ]
  7910	Green:	That power buildup...
  7911	Tsu:	Mmm... 
  7912		[ Tsu raises the palms of her hands towards GreenCoat and... ]
  7913	Green:	That's it?! [ stops bracing himself, nothing happened ]
  7914	Tsu:	Darn, what was the next step?  Can't remember...
  7915	Green:	Here, maybe you were trying to something like this...
  7916		[ About to unleash another power blast ]
  7917		OOF!  [ someone knees him in the face ]
  7918	
  7919	Lo-shin: "Nihao"
  7920		[ ed note: she's dressed in a zombie's shirt uniform ]
  7921	
  7922	Kasumi:	She's so cute!
  7923	R-chan:	Lotion!  
  7924	Akane:	Dr. Tofu!
  7925	Tofu:	Looks like we're just in time.
  7926		[ he drops the body of an unconscious zombie, who happens to be
  7927		  missihg his shirt ]
  7928	Green:	By tose... Di tink it's broken...
  7929	Tsu:	You're finished.
  7930	Green:	<Sniff> Heh, you're merely humans.  You can't kill me.
  7931		You've hurt me, but you'll pay with your lives!
  7932		[ opens his mouth wide ]
  7933	Tofu:	Lotion-chan!  Watch out for his acid attack!
  7934	Green:	UHHH!
  7935	Akane:	Tsu...
  7936	Tsu:	[ sticking a stake in his back ] A life for a life, Fang scum.
  7937	R-chan:	You're a pretty cold guy, Tsu.
  7938	Tsu:	Good distraction, Lotion, Dr. Tofu.
  7939	Tofu:	[ shocked at her display of cold blood ] 
  7940		Wait, I don't believe we've been introduced..
  7941	Tsu:	Let's go, we have bigger pigs to fry.
  7942		[ everyone slowly files out except for Tsu, who remains ]
  7943	Green:	No....wait... I challenge you....
  7944	Tsu:	Cute humans shouldn't suffer this kind of pain,
  7945		especially you, Jo F. Water.
  7946		But since you're a vampire... [ leaves ]
  7947		
  7948	Green:	Purple... PURPLECoat...
  7949		[ He's all alone, lying in a pool of his own ichor ] 
  7950		Where the heck is my backup?!
  7951		[ Tsu comes back ]
  7952	Tsu:	<PTU!>  [ she spits at him and then leaves again ]
  7953	
  7954			*		*		*
  7955	
  7956	Commander:	What is going on?!
  7957	PurpleCoat:	Please, Commander, I'm a little busy trying to manage
  7958			our defense plan.
  7959	Commander:	We're under attack?
  7960	PurpleCoat:	Yes, I'm sensing several intruders.
  7961			Too much is happening, I can't sort it out.
  7962	Commander:	Who are our enemies?
  7963	PurpleCoat:	I believe they are two-fold.  Somehow our prisoners from
  7964			cells H and R block have escaped.  I believe they are
  7965			headed	this way.
  7966		But I'm more worried about the second group.  The vampire guards at
  7967		the front gate report that two metal monsters are attacking.
  7968		They've already decimated an entire vampire squadron.
  7969		They might actually have enough power to defeat us!
  7970	Commander:	Casualties?
  7971	PurpleCoat:	Two Dark-slaves, Ranma and Kunou are unaccounted for.
  7972			We've also lost a couple of vampires and a whole battallion
  7973			of zombies.
  7974	Commander:	They're expendible.  Recommendations?
  7975	PurpleCoat:	The prisoners will reach us first.
  7976			I told GreenCoat to head them off.
  7977			But I haven't heard any word from him yet.
  7978	Commander:	They must be mighty indeed to defeat him.
  7979	PurpleCoat:	Yes, he's a good fighter despite himself.
  7980			Blast!  I can't raise Gosunkugi.  Where is he?!
  7981	Commander:	Recall all available Dark-Slaves and vampires immediately.
  7982	PurpleCoat:	Can't.  We need the vampires to hold off the external
  7983			intruders and some idiot had the Dark-Slaves go on patrols
  7984			all throughout the complex.  They'll never arrive in time.
  7985	Commander:	Very well, it will be up to our own power to stop them,
  7986			the way it should be.
  7987	PurpleCoat:	Wait, there is no need for that, I have a plan...
  7988	
  7989			*		*		*
  7990	
  7991	Taihen:	Move it Nabiki.  We need the Golden Pair in whatever condition
  7992		they're in.
  7993	Nabiki:	No!  You can't!
  7994	Taihen:	Look, I don't have time to fool around, Purple's gonna have my head
  7995		if.. What, they're all gone. [ The tanks are ALL empty ]
  7996		What did you do with them?!
  7997	Nabiki:	I um...they felt better and asked to go for a walk!
  7998	Taihen:	What kind of idiot do you think I am?!
  7999	Nabiki:	A hormone crazed one?
  8000	Taihen:	[ Slapping her down ] You traitoress!
  8001	Nabiki:	No.. you've got it all wrong..  I really don't know..
  8002		They were missing when I started working but I wanted to keep the
  8003		extra diamond dust for myself..
  8004	Taihen:	I should kill you..
  8005	Nabiki:	[ trembling ] Not as long as I have this silver pendent..
  8006	Taihen:	You really think that little trinket will protect you from the
  8007		wrath of the Fang?  You're not dealing with amateurs anymore.
  8008		Why I... [ stops as if recieving a mental message ]
  8009		I'll deal with you later.  [ he leaves the room ]
  8010	Nabiki:	[ trembling on the ground ] What have I done?
  8011		What have I gotten myself into?

  8014	
  8015	[ At the Fang Central, PurpleCoat and the Strike Commander anxiously await
  8016	  the arrival of their foes.  The doors shatter open in a thunderclap as
  8017	  Ranma-chan, Tsu, Tofu and  Akane run in  ]
  8018	
  8019	Purple:	They're right on time.  
  8020	
  8021	Ranma:	We found them!
  8022	Akane:	I'm glad Lotion is taking care of Sister.
  8023	Tofu:	Well, she um.. insisted upon it.
  8024	
  8025	Tsu:	It is time for you to pay for your sins!
  8026	Purple:	And who's going to stop me, you?
  8027		Your little rag-tag resistance force doesn't stand a chance.
  8028		Most of you can barely stand, I see our troopers have left their mark..
  8029	
  8030	[ Ranma-chan is starting to drift off due to her lack of blood,
  8031	  Tsu is clutching her broken ribs,
  8032	  Dr. Tofu is feeling his chest where he was badly burned by acid,
  8033	  and Akane is panting and sweating like a pig ]
  8034	
  8035	Akane:	Maybe he's right..
  8036	R-chan:	So weak...
  8037	Tofu:	No!  Don't listen to him, he's trying to hypnotise us..
  8038	Ranma:	It's working..
  8039	Tsu:	Purple.. you're mine! [ leaps up drawing her sword ]
  8040	Purple:	Do I know you? 
  8041	Commander: Now!
  8042		[ Suddenly the cast is smothered in soot.  At that time PurpleCoat
  8043		and the strike commander put on white robes ]
  8044	Tofu:	What?
  8045	
  8046	[ At that time a door at the opposite end explodes in.  Two people, a young
  8047	man and a young woman wearing trencoats, glide through ] 
  8048	
  8049	Aih:	ESPoilce!  Freeze!
  8050	R-chan:	ES what?
  8051	Kay:	We don't know what's going on, but everyone put their hands to
  8052		their heads!  What did I tell you, Aih-san?  I knew this was the
  8053		right place!  I have a sixth sense when it comes to tracking.
  8054	Aih:	And I just thought it was just the way we were constantly attacked
  8055		ever since we approached this mansion.
  8056	Purple:	Please protect us from these demons!
  8057	Akane:	What?!
  8058	Aih:	You there with the sword, put it down!
  8059	Tsu:	[ hisses ] You idiots!  We're the..
  8060	
  8061	[ His words are cut short by the arrival of two vampires.  The jump down
  8062	  from the ceiling and surround The Commander and PurpleCoat. ]
  8063	
  8064	[ ed note: The vampires are covered in soot and have dried blood covering
  8065	thier clothes, just like Ranma-chan, Akane and Tsu ]
  8066	
  8067	Vamp1:	Protect the masterssss!  I will slay the prisonerssss!
  8068	Akane:	What?!
  8069	Kay:	That did it!
  8070		[ he throws off his trenchcoat to reveal he is wearing a fairly
  8071		sophsicated piece of battle armor.  He also has a rifle and shoots
  8072		at the vampire ]
  8073	Vamp1:	Foolish, mortal!  Do you really thinksss a single bullet can hurt me?
  8074		[ Aih likewise has her own cannon and hires a couple of hundred
  8075		rounds into the vampire ]
  8076	Aih:	How about a couple hundred bullets?
  8077	Vamp1:	...!
  8078	Kay:	And we've also got a lot worse!
  8079	
  8080	Tsu:	Uhh!  Magical surge.. their spell caster is activating the spell!
  8081		No time!  [ Jumps toward PurpleCoat ]
  8082	Kay:	I told you to freeze!
  8083		[ shoots Tsu with blast from his wrist, twin electron beams slam
  8084		into Tsu ]
  8085	Tsu:	Electric shock... My heart!... [ falls unconscious ]
  8086	R-chan:	Why you...! [ advances on Kay only to be shot down too ]
  8087	Aih:	Calm down everyone!  They're only stunned, but if you'll join them
  8088		too if you all don't settle down.
  8089	Purple:	Save us from these dark demons!
  8090	Akane:	Now just wait a minute, you guys put black soot...
  8091	Vamp2:	You hurt my Mistressessss!  You will pay! [ leaps toward Aih ]
  8092	Kay:	Aih-san!  [ shoots the vampire down with his automatic rifle ]
  8093		I'm tired of fooling around!
  8094	Aih:	No.. don't...  
  8095	Tofu:	If you'll only..  [ he gets stunned along with Akane ]
  8096	Commander: Thank you for saving our lives...!  
  8097	Aih:	Wait, slow down, too much is happening..
  8098	Purple:	I now call upon the power of the lightening!
  8099	
  8100	[ PurpleCoat raises his arms high.  And then a window shatters as a
  8101	lightening bolt from the outside storm hurles down and strikes the two
  8102	unsuspecting ESPolice officers. ]
  8103	
  8104	Aih:	What in..?  Agh!
  8105	Kay:	Aih-san...
  8106	
  8107	[ PurpleCoat then finishes with two with a blast of ki-energy ]
  8108	Kay:	Ahhh!
  8109	Aih:	I'm not down yet... [ stuggling to get up ]
  8110		uh.. systems fused..
  8111	Commander: Of course my dear.  Have a taste of my power.
  8112	[ He points towards her and immediately her armor is stripped off her ]
  8113	
  8114	Aih:	Another telekenetic...?!
  8115	Purple:	Sleep... [ his eyes glow with a hypnotic light ]
  8116	Aih:	Kay-kun.. help me... uh... [ falls unconscious ]
  8117	
  8118	Commander: The plan worked, with no unrecoverable losses on our part.
  8119	Purple:	Yes, we managed to distract them long enough to have them lower
  8120		their guard.  It's a shame we had to diminish the thunderstorm to
  8121		draw the extra power.
  8122	Commander: But as long as we keep our forces indoors, there shouldn't be a
  8123		problem.  And the vampires we lose, we can always replace.
  8124		[ looking down at the defeated heros ]
  8125		Poor pathetic fools, they never really had a chance.
  8126		They've only come this far because we let them...
  8127		But it was all in vain, the Leader comes, soon!
  8128	
  8129	Purple:	Ahem!  Might I suggest that we send a repair crew to seal that
  8130		window immediately?!
  8131	
  8132	R-chan:	[ stirring ] ESPolice no Baka...
  8133	
  8134			*		*		*
  8135		Dr Kno poured over the data.  Twelve other cities in Japan had the
  8136	same conditions as the one officers Kay and Aih were assigned to.  All of
  8137	them were cut off from the rest of the world and had unsual weather
  8138	patterns surrounding the local area.  He had a map of the situation up on
  8139	the board.  "What do you make of it?", he asked his aids.
  8140	"Well, how about we connect dots to see if we can make a picture?", asked
  8141	Aide A.
  8142		"That's stupid!  You've been watching too many detective movies",
  8143		Aide B exclaimed. 
  8144	"What if we connect them in order that they started exhibiting these
  8145	conditions.. ", Aide C started writing. 
  8146	"Hey look!  He's drawing letters!", Aide D pointed out.
  8147		"F-A-N-G, Fang!", Aide A read out.
  8148	"Fang?  What the does it mean.", asked Aide B.
  8149		"Sharpened tooth.", Aide C proudly explained.
  8150	"You idiot...!"
  8151		"I think you spelled it out wrong."
  8152	"Yeah, it should be F-I-S-H.  Fish!"
  8153		"Fish?  That's even dumber than before."
  8154	"No you both got it wrong.  It spells S-U-S-H-I, Sushi!"
  8155		"Sushi?"
  8156	"NoNoNo!  It spells F-O-O-D"
  8157		"Hey, who's hungry?"
  8158	"Me!"
  8159		"Fool!  How can you think of food as a critical time like this?!"
  8160	"I think it spells F-O-O-L for Aide D"
  8161		"Yeah, I think you're right."
  8162	"I'll get you for that!"
  8163	
  8164		As his aides started fighting again, Dr. Kno just looked over his
  8165	other project notes.  We was studying a prototype power screen for a
  8166	possible defense shield to protect Japan.  It was very ingenious, the idea
  8167	was to couple 13 generators at strategic locations in Japan, dependent on
  8168	the shape of the land to optimize the power and...
  8169	Dr Kno stared at the map.  The positions coincided.  He wasn't sure what
  8170	this meant, but in the pit of his stomach he had a very bad feeling.  And
  8171	it just wasn't hunger.  At the very least they might have a double agent
  8172	in the ranks.
  8173	
  8174	 		*		*		*
  8175		In the cavern where Ranma's strike force had their first battle, a
  8176	figure steps out from the shadows.   The stranger looks around the room at
  8177	all the destruction and loss of life.  He takes a breath and remembers the
  8178	last battle he was in, where both friend and foe fell fighting.
  8179	At one end of the room, Kunou's body still lies silently on the floor.  The
  8180	figure looks sadly at him.  "Rest in piece, fallen one", the stranger dips
  8181	his hand into the, still wet, tears of Akane's that lie on his face.
  8182	Looking around once more, the stranger sees a pool of dark ichor.  He draws
  8183	near to examine the liquid.
  8184		"So, he still lives.  They should have cut off his head.  What an
  8185	amateur show.", the stranger paused for a moment and then turned skyward
  8186	and shouted out his pledge, "He still lives while the blood of innocents
  8187	remain shed.  My work on earth is not done.  But by the lives of the fallen
  8188	souls, I swear it shall end!  Fight on, my friends, your sacrifice shall
  8189	not be in vain!  Victory shall be ours!"
  8190		"What the heck was that?!", a voice beyond the corrider asked.
  8191	"What was what?", a second voice asked the first.  "I didn't hear anything."
  8192		"I could have sworn I heard someone making a speech."
  8193	As quickly as he came, the stranger left, like a prowler in the night.
  8194	"You must be hearing things, I don't see anything but corpses.
  8195		"Yeah, I guess  you're right.  I guess I'm just too tired from all
  8196		this work they make us do."
  8197	"So?  It's not like we have much of a choice.  We can't exatly form a
  8198	union."
  8199	Moments later, silence again dominated the cavern.  And then a single
  8200	whisper carried across the room.
  8201		"Tendo Akane... I love you..."
  8202

  8204	[ Elsewhere in a somewhat safer location... ]
  8205	
  8206	Kasumi:	So, Lotion-chan, is it?
  8207	Lo-shin: Yes.
  8208	Kasumi:	You seem to very close with Dr. Tofu.  How long have you known him?
  8209	Lo-shin: Tofu-san?  Only couple days, but feel like lifetime.
  8210	Kasumi:	Oh, really.
  8211	Lo-shin: Yes, he so gentle, and strong, and...
  8212	Kasumi:	And...
  8213	Lo-shin: What?  We not alone...

  8217	Shampoo: Nihao.
  8218	Lo-shin: Shampoo! [ stares at her glowing red eyes ]
  8219	Mousse:	Lo-shin.  [ he suddenly appeares behind her ]
  8220	Lo-shin: Mousse... We're surrounded.
  8221		[ around them, figures are emerging from the shadows ]

  8225	[ Taihen is helping GreenCoat to walk down a corrider ]
  8226	
  8227	Taihen:	Are you sure, you're okay?
  8228	Green:	Fine... just to be glad to have that thing out of me...gasp..
  8229	Taihen:	Easy.
  8230	Green:	Heh, it'll take more than that to stop GreenCoat! Cough!  Gasp!
  8231	Taihen:	You're just lucky I came when I did.
  8232	Green:	You were late.
  8233	Taihen:	Sorry, some things came up.
  8234	Green:	But we nailed those twerps, right?
  8235	Taihen:	Yeah, everything is pretty much taken care of.
  8236	Green:	Everything?
  8237	Taihen:	Everything.  We just have to sort and identify everything and clear
  8238		up those bodies.  The blood is so delicious, but the smell.. P.U.!
  8239	Green:	Hey, don't knock it!  That's where Purple went for undergrad.
  8240	Taihen:	Sorry.
  8241	Green:	It's okay.  How's Kunou?
  8242	Taihen:	He's a goner.
  8243	Green:	Oh well, not like he was especially important or anything.
  8244	Taihen:	I never liked him anyway.
  8245	Green:	Why?  Too much competition? [ chuckles ]
  8246	Taihen:	Yeah yeah yeah...
  8247	Green: 	Oooh, that hurts when I laugh..
  8248		So, I hear the Boss is coming.
  8249	Taihen:	Very soon.  The spellcaster has withdrawn all her spells to
  8250		prepare for this one.
  8251	Green:	ALL?!  Doesn't that include the misdirection field?
  8252		Lately we've been having X-factors crop up like crazy.
  8253	Taihen:	Don't worry.  At this point nothing can stop us.
  8254	Green:	Good, then let's go catch a movie.
  8255	Taihen:	What?  But how?  We can't leave the grounds.
  8256	Green:	No problem, I ran over a video store when I held up that jewelry
  8257		store for Nabiki.
  8258	Taihen:	Yes, Nabiki...
  8259		Wait, we're supposed to be on duty!
  8260	Green:	So?  After what I've been through, I know I deserve a break!
  8261		Besides, we caught everybody.  What could possible go wrong?

  8265		In a distant cavern, behind tons of rubble and magical wards,
  8266	a most disturbing and unatural disaster occured.  Some unrelenting force
  8267	teared asunder the stoney entrance which was entrapping the poor souls that
  8268	were lying dormant inside.  In the dust, a figure in blue robes glides
  8269	through.
  8270		"Which one of you here is Happosai?"
  8271	A small emancipated man looks up and asks, "Sen..Sensei?!"
  8272	Within the hood of the robe, one can almost image two eyes glaring out and
  8273	squinting down.  "Happy?!"

  8275		Need I bother saying it?  To be continued.
  8276	
  8277	Character Profile:	The Strike Commander
  8278		His real name is unknown.  He is not a very sociable sort so no one
  8279	really knows him.  All he cares about is doing is job and rising in the
  8280	hearchary.  He's like an aggresive corporate raider.  He was a member of
  8281	some Fang cult.  He rised to his current rank by showing some spunk and
  8282	talking back to the Absolute Leader of the Fang.  His gamble paid off and he
  8283	only suffered a blast of lightening to his left arm.  Luckily for himself,
  8284	he's a healer.
  8285		Frankly he hates most of his subordinates and they hate him, with
  8286	the exception of PurpleCoat, who is stricly business.  But he's still their
  8287	commander.  His main abilities seem to be healing powers, which is kind of
  8288	ironic considering his line of work.  He can enhance human life but it is
  8289	unknown if he can actually heal a vampire of his injuries.  He installed
  8290	the regeneration healing tanks by his powers, basically an injured person
  8291	is placed in these tanks to be healed.  They can peserve bodies if not
  8292	lives, some injuries are just too severe.  He also seems to be a strong
  8293	telekenetic with enough skill to actually choke people from a distance.  It
  8294	is also theorized that he can make small telekenetic shields, only about
  8295	the size of his palm but strong enough to resist repeated blows from
  8296	Roaring Lion Bullet.  
  8297	
  8298	Physical Description:
  8299		He is a very tall handsome young man in black shiny soft velvet
  8300	robes.  During battle, he wears a Dark helmet covering his entire face.
  8301	How he can see through it, nobody knows.  He looks very similar to the dark
  8302	swordsman the Daicon Bunny fought in Daicon opening animation IV.

  8331	Dr Kno:	So that's the story, huh?
  8332	Aih:	Yes.
  8333	Kay:	That's one heck of a debriefing.
  8334	Dr Kno:	This is incredible.  The data we accumulated on this alone..
  8335	Aih:	Over sixty men, women and children died.
  8336		This isn't incredible, it's tragic!
  8337	Dr Kno:	Yes, yes, well that's how it happens sometimes.
  8338	Aih:	I can't believe you! [ storms out ]
  8339	Kay:	Aih-san!
  8340	Dr Kno:	Let her go, she's too idealistic and soft.
  8341		She was never cut out for this line of work.
  8342	Kay:	....
  8343		If Aih-san leaves, so do I!
  8344		And you can stuff your threats about my family!
  8345		Aih-san!  Wait! [ chases after her ]

  8352	Nabiki:	How is Akane feeling?
  8353	Kasumi:	As well as can be expected.
  8354	Nabiki:	Here she comes...
  8355		Akane!  Umm, nice funeral wasn't it?
  8356	Akane:	...
  8357		It's okay, sister.  You don't have to cheer me up.
  8358	Kasumi:	Akane...
  8359	Akane:	Sister, don't worry about me.  I'm strong!
  8360		A thing like this won't bother me.
  8361	
  8362	Nabiki:	[ aside ] She was always the most emotional one.
  8363		When mother died, Akane cried for 2 years.
  8364		Although she may be smiling on the outside,
  8365		she's crying like a little ten year old girl on the inside.
  8366	
  8367	Akane:	Sister?  Why is Nabiki going off by herself like that?
  8368	
  8369	Kasumi:	Although she may act rough and uncaring,
  8370		she was always bothered by death.
  8371		Instead of facing the problem, she often pushed it out of her
  8372		mind and drove herself into other things to forget.
  8373		When mother died, you were really to young to fully comprehend it.
  8374		But since that day, Nabiki hardened her heart and vowed to love
  8375		only the things that she could alsways count on and would never
  8376		betray her. 
  8377	
  8378	Akane:	Money..
  8379	Kasumi:	It's really tragic.
  8380	Akane:	But what about you, sister?
  8381	Kasumi:	Someone has to be the one to keep everything together.
  8382		And as eldest of the Tendo children, the responsibliy is mine
  8383		and mine alone.
  8384	
  8385	Ryouga:	Akane-san, Kasumi-san.
  8386	Akane:	Ryouga-kun!
  8387	Ryouga:	I have come to pay my respects.
  8388		I know the others have come too, but I just had to come by myself.
  8389	Akane:	Well, you probably knew him the longest.
  8390		In a way, he was your oldest friend.
  8391	Ryouga:	He may have not been the best person in the world,
  8392		but he was a good man.  He had a lot of qualities to admire.
  8393	Akane:	Yes, he always meant well.  I always misjudged him,
  8394		but now I realize that he always tried to protect me.	
  8395		I miss him so much.
  8396	Ryouga:	Rest in piece, Ranma.

  8399	[ The following dialogue occurs in Cantonese ]
  8400	
  8401	Lo-shin: So what will you do now, Mousse?
  8402	Mousse:	What else?  Go back to China.
  8403		There's nothing left for me here.
  8404	Lo-shin: There's nothing left for you there, either.
  8405		The village was destroyed, the people, killed.
  8406		Everyone, including the village Elders.
  8407	Mousse:	All the more reason to return.
  8408		I refuse to believe that our people gave up so easily.
  8409		They must be scattered about, they're going to need everyone
  8410		from the village to restore it.  We must preserve our old ways.
  8411	Lo-shin: What about Shampoo?
  8412	Moussse: Ha!  She never loved me, and she never will.
  8413		I realize that now, I just couldn't accept it, until now.
  8414		Already she's found another foreign man to lay with.
  8415	Lo-shin: You speak of customs!  You speak of old ways!
  8416		But isn't becuase of our battle rituals Shampoo is forced
  8417		to walk this destiny?!
  8418	Mousse:	Hahahahah!  Lo-shin!  It's so good to have you back, little sister.
  8419		You've grown so much.  But maybe you are right.
  8420		Maybe it is time to change the old ways into the new ways.
  8421		For if we cannot adapt with the changing world, a disaster like
  8422		this is just bound to happen again.
  8423		Lo-shin, come with me!
  8424		We can certainly use your help in rebuilding the village.
  8425	Lo-shin: ...
  8426		No  I cannot.  I can never again return to the old ways.
  8427		I have tasted what this new world is offering and cannot come back.
  8428		If only you asked me last year, you would have made me the
  8429		happiest girl in the world.  But I cannot.
  8430	Mousse:	Lo-shin, what is it?  You're talking strangely.
  8431	Lo-shin: ...
  8432	Mousse: Come, it is your big brother Mousse.
  8433		You can tell me, you know me better than that to judge you.
  8434	Lo-shin: I am with child.

  8437	Tofu:	So you will take your leave of us?
  8438	Tsu:	Yes, my work is done here.
  8439		There are other responsibilities that need my attention.
  8440	Tofu:	I just wanted to tell you, thank you.
  8441	Tsu:	No, I should be thanking you.
  8442		Too often I had been alone fighting the forces of darkness.
  8443		I am weary of all the death that surrounds me.
  8444	Tofu:	So where will you go?
  8445	Tsu:	I am still unsure, where the wind blows I suppose.
  8446		I just seem to Wander from place to place, not having a clue.
  8447		Where ever I go, there is always some wrong to right.
  8448	Tofu:	May i ask of you a boon?
  8449	Tsu:	Of course.
  8450	Tsou:	Let me go with you.
  8451	Tsu:	What?  Why?
  8452	Tofu:	I have nothing here.
  8453	Tsu:	But your practice..
  8454	Tofu:	Means nothing!  I need a fresh start...
  8455		After what I have been through, the same old life holds 
  8456		no pleasure for me.  I need excitement!  I crave adventure,
  8457		as I first did in the days of my youth.
  8458	Tsu:	Really?
  8459	Tofu:	...
  8460		No, there are other reasons as well.
  8461		I can't go back to my practice.
  8462	Tsu:	Why not?  Everyone holds you in the highest regards..
  8463	Tofu:	Because I can't trust myself.  I broke my trust as a physician.
  8464		I was intimate with one of my patients..
  8465	Tsu:	What?  But I would hardly call that..
  8466	Tofu:	You don't understand...
  8467		The temptation was always there, but I always resisted.
  8468		Do you know how many young girls I treat every day?
  8469		Do you know how easy it is to seduce them?
  8470		And they all have these fantasies about me.
  8471		They've been reading too many sojo manga.
  8472		But that last time, I just couldn't help myself.
  8473		We were all alone together, and neither one of us thought
  8474		we would ever see the next day.  
  8475		I'm just afraid that I'll succumb again.
  8476	Tsu:	Well, Dr. Tofu, you are a fairly handsome man.
  8477	Tofu:	Thank you but you don't have to..
  8478	Tsu:	I speak truth, nothing more.
  8479		But if you do wish to follow, then you must leave everything
  8480		behind.  There is no turning back.
  8481	Tofu:	I understand.
  8482	Tsu:	Good, we leave within the hour.

  8487		I'm going to quit.  This isn't for me.	I can't stand it.
  8488	Kay:	So what are you going to do?
  8489	Aih:	I don't know.  We're still in college, you know.
  8490	Kay:	Don't remind me!
  8491	Aih:	I just have to get away from all this.
  8492		Away from the killing and the nightmares.
  8493	Kay:	Where will you go?
  8494	Aih:	Maybe America.  I have relatives there.
  8495	Kay:	But that's an entirely different place.
  8496	Aih:	Well, I always had this crazy dream of being a Pop Singer.
  8497		And I heard that America is a great place for foreign talent.
  8498	Kay:	Yeah, I heard you sing once, you were amazing.
  8499	Aih:	[ smiles ] Thank you.
  8500	Kay:	Aih-san, if you're leaving, then so am I
  8501	Aih:	Kay-kun...
  8502	Kay:	You're the most important thing to me, Aih-san.
  8503		I won't lose you.  I already turned in my badge and weapon.
  8504	Aih:	I.. I'm glad.
  8505		It'll be nice to have a friend in a strange new country.
  8506	Kay:	Then I'll wait for you here.
  8507	Aih:	You won't be coming with me?
  8508	Kay:	Why?  What can I do there?  Become a grocery clerk?
  8509		America isn't a great opportunity place for
  8510		non-english speaking immigrants.
  8511	Aih:	Well, that might be what you're going to do here.
  8512		Your grades weren't that great.
  8513	Kay:	Sure, rub it in!
  8514	Aih:	Just kidding!
  8515	
  8516	[ The two laugh for a little while ]
  8517	
  8518	Kay:	You can't stay in America forever.  I'll wait for you as long as it
  8519		takes.
  8520	Aih:	Will you wait for me forever?
  8521	Kay:	Don't make fun of me!  I'm serious!

  8543	Ryouga:	Are you disappointed in me, Akane-san?

  8562		The trama was too much for him.  It made him snap.
  8563	Kasumi:	There's no one else to take care of the Tendo dojo.
  8564	Nabiki:	I know... but why him?!
  8565	Kasumi:	Because he was Father's closest friend.
  8566		There's no one else.
  8567	Nabiki:	Then why you?
  8568	Kasumi:	I am the eldest.  The responsibility is mine.
  8569	Nabiki:	That's no reason to get married.
  8570	Kasumi:	Yes it is.  It's about honor.  It's about duty.

  8583	Mousse:	Lo-shin, you're right.  I'm sorry.
  8584		It's just that it was a big shock.
  8585		Does he know?
  8586	Lo-shin: No.  Not yet.  I had to think about it first.
  8587	Mousse:	Lo-shin, my boat is leaving soon.

  8639	Kunou:	I know not if this be the happiest day of my life
  8640		or a black day of mourning.
  8641		I am a changed man, ever since my near death experience.
  8642		I am now a man of humility, even I can be killed in battle...
  8643	
  8644		Even as I speak, my sister is being buried.
  8645		A fornight ago, the love of my life, died by my sword.
  8646		Her memory still lingers within me.
  8647		Little Pony-tailed haired girl, I loved you so much!
  8648		But I must honor her sacrifice by living on.
  8649

  8665	Tofu:	So, it's finished.
  8666	
  8667	Tsu:	Yes.  I have chopped off all their heads and embedded a stake
  8668		in each of their hearts.  
  8669	Tofu:	They are all being cremated tomorrow, was it really necessary?
  8670	Tsu:	One can never be too sure.
  8671	Tofu:	This is such a dark ending.
  8672		Perhaps it would have been different in another time, another life.
  8673	Tsu:	This is life, old friend.  This is the Yin and the Yang.
  8674		Life has it's light sides and Dark Halves.

  8680	  Mousse is slowly rebuilding his village.
  8681	  Kay & Aih say goodbye at the dock with their first kiss

  8693		and surfaces as a man.  Ultimately becomes an assassin for hire.
  8694	  Kay reads about a new young Japanese Pop singer who ran into the wrong

  8699	Tsu:	Do not despair, friend Tofu.  I believe that somewhere, all your
  8700		friends are still alive and happy, living out the rest of their
  8701		natural lives in their normal mundane worlds.
  8702		But, that is in another time, another place.

  8735	Dr Kno:	So that's the story, huh?
  8736	Aih:	Yes.
  8737	Kay:	That's one heck of a debriefing.
  8738	Dr Kno:	This is incredible.  The data we accumulated on this alone..
  8739	Aih:	Over sixty men, women and children died.
  8740		This isn't incredible, it's tragic!
  8741	Dr Kno:	Yes, yes, well that's how it happens sometimes.
  8742	Aih:	I can't believe you! [ storms out ]
  8743	Kay:	Aih-san!
  8744	Dr Kno:	Let her go, she's too idealistic and soft.
  8745		She was never cut out for this line of work.
  8746	Kay:	....
  8747		If Aih-san leaves, so do I!
  8748		And you can stuff your threats about my family!
  8749		Aih-san!  Wait! [ chases after her ]

  8756	Nabiki:	How is Akane feeling?
  8757	Kasumi:	As well as can be expected.
  8758	Nabiki:	Here she comes...
  8759		Akane!  Umm, nice funeral wasn't it?
  8760	Akane:	...
  8761		It's okay, sister.  You don't have to cheer me up.
  8762	Kasumi:	Akane...
  8763	Akane:	Sister, don't worry about me.  I'm strong!
  8764		A thing like this won't bother me.
  8765	
  8766	Nabiki:	[ aside ] She was always the most emotional one.
  8767		When mother died, Akane cried for 2 years.
  8768		Although she may be smiling on the outside,
  8769		she's crying like a little ten year old girl on the inside.
  8770	
  8771	Akane:	Sister?  Why is Nabiki going off by herself like that?
  8772	
  8773	Kasumi:	Although she may act rough and uncaring,
  8774		she was always bothered by death.
  8775		Instead of facing the problem, she often pushed it out of her
  8776		mind and drove herself into other things to forget.
  8777		When mother died, you were really to young to fully comprehend it.
  8778		But since that day, Nabiki hardened her heart and vowed to love
  8779		only the things that she could alsways count on and would never
  8780		betray her. 
  8781	
  8782	Akane:	Money..
  8783	Kasumi:	It's really tragic.
  8784	Akane:	But what about you, sister?
  8785	Kasumi:	Someone has to be the one to keep everything together.
  8786		And as eldest of the Tendo children, the responsibliy is mine
  8787		and mine alone.
  8788	
  8789	Ryouga:	Akane-san, Kasumi-san.
  8790	Akane:	Ryouga-kun!
  8791	Ryouga:	I have come to pay my respects.
  8792		I know the others have come too, but I just had to come by myself.
  8793	Akane:	Well, you probably knew him the longest.
  8794		In a way, he was your oldest friend.
  8795	Ryouga:	He may have not been the best person in the world,
  8796		but he was a good man.  He had a lot of qualities to admire.
  8797	Akane:	Yes, he always meant well.  I always misjudged him,
  8798		but now I realize that he always tried to protect me.	
  8799		I miss him so much.
  8800	Ryouga:	Rest in piece, Ranma.

  8803	[ The following dialogue occurs in Cantonese ]
  8804	
  8805	Lo-shin: So what will you do now, Mousse?
  8806	Mousse:	What else?  Go back to China.
  8807		There's nothing left for me here.
  8808	Lo-shin: There's nothing left for you there, either.
  8809		The village was destroyed, the people, killed.
  8810		Everyone, including the village Elders.
  8811	Mousse:	All the more reason to return.
  8812		I refuse to believe that our people gave up so easily.
  8813		They must be scattered about, they're going to need everyone
  8814		from the village to restore it.  We must preserve our old ways.
  8815	Lo-shin: What about Shampoo?
  8816	Moussse: Ha!  She never loved me, and she never will.
  8817		I realize that now, I just couldn't accept it, until now.
  8818		Already she's found another foreign man to lay with.
  8819	Lo-shin: You speak of customs!  You speak of old ways!
  8820		But isn't becuase of our battle rituals Shampoo is forced
  8821		to walk this destiny?!
  8822	Mousse:	Hahahahah!  Lo-shin!  It's so good to have you back, little sister.
  8823		You've grown so much.  But maybe you are right.
  8824		Maybe it is time to change the old ways into the new ways.
  8825		For if we cannot adapt with the changing world, a disaster like
  8826		this is just bound to happen again.
  8827		Lo-shin, come with me!
  8828		We can certainly use your help in rebuilding the village.
  8829	Lo-shin: ...
  8830		No  I cannot.  I can never again return to the old ways.
  8831		I have tasted what this new world is offering and cannot come back.
  8832		If only you asked me last year, you would have made me the
  8833		happiest girl in the world.  But I cannot.
  8834	Mousse:	Lo-shin, what is it?  You're talking strangely.
  8835	Lo-shin: ...
  8836	Mousse: Come, it is your big brother Mousse.
  8837		You can tell me, you know me better than that to judge you.
  8838	Lo-shin: I am with child.

  8841	Tofu:	So you will take your leave of us?
  8842	Tsu:	Yes, my work is done here.
  8843		There are other responsibilities that need my attention.
  8844	Tofu:	I just wanted to tell you, thank you.
  8845	Tsu:	No, I should be thanking you.
  8846		Too often I had been alone fighting the forces of darkness.
  8847		I am weary of all the death that surrounds me.
  8848	Tofu:	So where will you go?
  8849	Tsu:	I am still unsure, where the wind blows I suppose.
  8850		I just seem to Wander from place to place, not having a clue.
  8851		Where ever I go, there is always some wrong to right.
  8852	Tofu:	May i ask of you a boon?
  8853	Tsu:	Of course.
  8854	Tsou:	Let me go with you.
  8855	Tsu:	What?  Why?
  8856	Tofu:	I have nothing here.
  8857	Tsu:	But your practice..
  8858	Tofu:	Means nothing!  I need a fresh start...
  8859		After what I have been through, the same old life holds 
  8860		no pleasure for me.  I need excitement!  I crave adventure,
  8861		as I first did in the days of my youth.
  8862	Tsu:	Really?
  8863	Tofu:	...
  8864		No, there are other reasons as well.
  8865		I can't go back to my practice.
  8866	Tsu:	Why not?  Everyone holds you in the highest regards..
  8867	Tofu:	Because I can't trust myself.  I broke my trust as a physician.
  8868		I was intimate with one of my patients..
  8869	Tsu:	What?  But I would hardly call that..
  8870	Tofu:	You don't understand...
  8871		The temptation was always there, but I always resisted.
  8872		Do you know how many young girls I treat every day?
  8873		Do you know how easy it is to seduce them?
  8874		And they all have these fantasies about me.
  8875		They've been reading too many sojo manga.
  8876		But that last time, I just couldn't help myself.
  8877		We were all alone together, and neither one of us thought
  8878		we would ever see the next day.  
  8879		I'm just afraid that I'll succumb again.
  8880	Tsu:	Well, Dr. Tofu, you are a fairly handsome man.
  8881	Tofu:	Thank you but you don't have to..
  8882	Tsu:	I speak truth, nothing more.
  8883		But if you do wish to follow, then you must leave everything
  8884		behind.  There is no turning back.
  8885	Tofu:	I understand.
  8886	Tsu:	Good, we leave within the hour.

  8890	Aih:	I can't take it anymore, Kay-kun.
  8891		I'm going to quit.  This isn't for me.	I can't stand it.
  8892	Kay:	So what are you going to do?
  8893	Aih:	I don't know.  We're still in college, you know.
  8894	Kay:	Don't remind me!
  8895	Aih:	I just have to get away from all this.
  8896		Away from the killing and the nightmares.
  8897	Kay:	Where will you go?
  8898	Aih:	Maybe America.  I have relatives there.
  8899	Kay:	But that's an entirely different place.
  8900	Aih:	Well, I always had this crazy dream of being a Pop Singer.
  8901		And I heard that America is a great place for foreign talent.
  8902	Kay:	Yeah, I heard you sing once, you were amazing.
  8903	Aih:	[ smiles ] Thank you.
  8904	Kay:	Aih-san, if you're leaving, then so am I
  8905	Aih:	Kay-kun...
  8906	Kay:	You're the most important thing to me, Aih-san.
  8907		I won't lose you.  I already turned in my badge and weapon.
  8908	Aih:	I.. I'm glad.
  8909		It'll be nice to have a friend in a strange new country.
  8910	Kay:	Then I'll wait for you here.
  8911	Aih:	You won't be coming with me?
  8912	Kay:	Why?  What can I do there?  Become a grocery clerk?
  8913		America isn't a great opportunity place for
  8914		non-english speaking immigrants.
  8915	Aih:	Well, that might be what you're going to do here.
  8916		Your grades weren't that great.
  8917	Kay:	Sure, rub it in!
  8918	Aih:	Just kidding!
  8919	
  8920	[ The two laugh for a little while ]
  8921	
  8922	Kay:	You can't stay in America forever.  I'll wait for you as long as it
  8923		takes.
  8924	Aih:	Will you wait for me forever?
  8925	Kay:	Don't make fun of me!  I'm serious!
  8926	Aih:	So was I.
  8927	Kay:	Just don't take too long, okay?

  8934		Ever since Ranma found out about Ukyou...
  8935		he's never been the same since.

  8944	Ryouga:	Apparently I KO'd her during that last fiasco.
  8945		With Ranma dead, she demands I live up to my responsibilities.
  8946	Akane:	I..see.
  8947	Ryouga:	Are you disappointed in me, Akane-san?

  8966		The trama was too much for him.  It made him snap.
  8967	Kasumi:	There's no one else to take care of the Tendo dojo.
  8968	Nabiki:	I know... but why him?!
  8969	Kasumi:	Because he was Father's closest friend.
  8970		There's no one else.
  8971	Nabiki:	Then why you?
  8972	Kasumi:	I am the eldest.  The responsibility is mine.
  8973	Nabiki:	That's no reason to get married.
  8974	Kasumi:	Yes it is.  It's about honor.  It's about duty.

  8987	Mousse:	Lo-shin, you're right.  I'm sorry.
  8988		It's just that it was a big shock.
  8989		Does he know?
  8990	Lo-shin: No.  Not yet.  I had to think about it first.

  9049		A fornight ago, the love of my life, died by my sword.
  9050		Her memory still lingers within me.
  9051		Little Pony-tailed haired girl, I loved you so much!
  9052		But I must honor her sacrifice by living on.
  9053	
  9054		Tendo Akane will become my bride in the morrow.
  9055		She will finally be mine..

  9058	Tsu:	I bid homage to you all!  Those who fought without fail!

  9062		I salute you Gosunkugi! <CLANG!>
  9063		I salute you.... <CLANG!>
  9064		...
  9065		May your sacrifice always be remembered.
  9066		Because of your shed blood, the Fang have been defeated forever.
  9067		Rest in piece.
  9068	
  9069	Tofu:	So, it's finished.
  9070	
  9071	Tsu:	Yes.  I have chopped off all their heads and embedded a stake
  9072		in each of their hearts.  
  9073	Tofu:	They are all being cremated tomorrow, was it really necessary?
  9074	Tsu:	One can never be too sure.
  9075	Tofu:	This is such a dark ending.
  9076		Perhaps it would have been different in another time, another life.
  9077	Tsu:	This is life, old friend.  This is the Yin and the Yang.
  9078		Life has it's light sides and Dark Halves.
  9079	
  9080	[ We see flashback shots of all the characters interacting.
  9081	  Then we move to the present as we see:
  9082	
  9083	  Lotion wanders the streets crying out Dr. Tofu's name.
  9084	  Mousse is slowly rebuilding his village.
  9085	  Kay & Aih say goodbye at the dock with their first kiss 
  9086	
  9087	  Switch to the ending marriage ceremonies of:
  9088			Genma & Kasumi 
  9089			Ryouga & Shampoo
  9090			Akane & Kunou

  9092	  Move up to the future as:
  9093	
  9094	  Some members of a rival Chinese village are feasting on roast duck.
  9095	  Switch to Nabiki who has become an alcholic and is drinking herself to death.
  9096	  Lotion returns to China, accidently slips into a pool,
  9097		and surfaces as a man.  Ultimately becomes an assassin for hire.
  9098	  Kay reads about a new young Japanese Pop singer who ran into the wrong
  9099		crowd, became involved in some scandals and is now a hopeless
  9100		drug addict. 
  9101	  ]
  9102	
  9103	Tsu:	Do not despair, friend Tofu.  I believe that somewhere, all your
  9104		friends are still alive and happy, living out the rest of their
  9105		natural lives in their normal mundane worlds.
  9106		But, that is in another time, another place.
  9107		Come, we must move on, Evil waits for no one.

  9129	Of course I had to blow away Continuity, but I'm doing that now anyway. (^_^)

  9173	
  9174		Like a Magic Panda from a Chinese Ledgend
  9175		Running out of the dojo on feet of air
  9176		With fists of power, toes of steel
  9177		Splitting the skies, the earth, the seas!
  9178		Ranma 1/2!
  9179		
  9180	[ Scene opens up as Ranma and his gang are running out from Tendo Dojo.
  9181	Dr. Tofu stops and looks pensive, holding a mystic seal.
  9182	Akane  smashes a block in half on the way.

  9184	FireWater appears in a cloud of smoke, uses his Winged Griffin Pounce
  9185	technique to summon the image of an saphire griffin.
  9186	
  9187	Lotion jumps in and throws darts uni-directionally.
  9188	
  9189	Ukyou gracefully swings her spatula around.
  9190	
  9191	Ranma goes through some of his martial arts forms.
  9192	An image of a Panda surrounds him while he does this.

  9194	
  9195	SONG:	When the forces of darkness arise!
  9196		When the demons of night threaten!
  9197		When the forces of evil attack!
  9198		Ranma 1/2!
  9199	[ The forces of the Fang as shadowy figures jump in and then take form.
  9200	
  9201	The Strike Commander levels the area around him with his telekinetic power
  9202	A cloud of mist forms into Taihen, who then promptly comb his hair.
  9203	The spell caster fades in, her hands crackling with energy.
  9204	PurpleCoat  appears with his eyes glowing hypnotically.
  9205	GreenCoat flies in lets out a acid bath from his mouth.
  9206	The outline of the Fang leader appears, hundreds of vampires and zombies
  9207	flock to the Leader, lightening flashes around them.
  9208	
  9209	Then PurpleCoat and GreenCoat stike their fists together and 
  9210	break up the screen 
  9211	]
  9212	
  9213	SONG:	Eternal night reigns unchallenged.
  9214		All hope seems lost, All resistance fades.
  9215		The innocents cry out!
  9216		Where are their champions?!
  9217		Ranma 1/2!
  9218	[ Next we see zombies and vampires attacking people.
  9219	  Gosunkugi is bitten, eyes start glowing, rips off his shirt
  9220	  and reveals he is wearing a Fang uniform underneath.
  9221	
  9222	  Kunou, as a Dark-slave, swings his sword around.
  9223	  Kodachi emersed in Black roses, twirls her ribbon around, occassionally
  9224	  striking at targets.
  9225	  Mousse and Shampoo fly through some beautiful battle maneuvers
  9226	  each showing off their skill at a wide assortment of weapons.
  9227	  Ryouga ends the scene with a huge blast of Ki-energy.

  9229

  9231		No matter the odds, No matter the plight!
  9232		We will strive!  We will win!
  9233		Never give up, not till the end!
  9234		Ranma 1/2!
  9235	[ Next scene more vampires are attacking.
  9236	  We see ESPolice officers Kay and Aih in battle gear blowing them away.
  9237	  But more keep coming, suddenly a Giant mecha behind them fires
  9238	  it's HUGE cannon at the horde.  Screen whitens with the energy release.

  9240	
  9241	SONG:	You are the ones!
  9242		The warriors of hope!

  9247	  to attack Ranma.  Ranma falls back, closes his eyes in concentration,
  9248	  and then unleashes his Dragon-Cyclone technique, blowing everyone away ]

  9280	R-chan:	I had a dream.. no something more, a vision.
  9281	Kay:	You mean like a precognative dream?
  9282		You wouldn't happen to be an esper, would you?
  9283	R-chan:	No, I'm not.  But if we continue on our course,

  9308		ramen. 
  9309	Kasumi:	See, isn't this easy?  We need more pepper.
  9310	Commander: I got it.  OW!  The oil hit my finger..

  9317		[ looking away ] Uh, I just want to thank you.
  9318		This might be hard to believe but, these past few moments have been
  9319		the most happiest time in my life.  Before, all I was interested in
  9320		was power and success.  But now I see there is enjoyment in just the
  9321		simple things in life, like cooking!
  9322	Kasumi:	I had fun too.  It's been so long since I had a chance to meet new
  9323		people.. 
  9324	Commander: You know, I had a dear friend, a long time ago.
  9325		You remind me of her so much.  We were so close...
  9326		Well, she's dead now, and I don't think I ever really got over it..
  9327		but I'm just glad to have met you now..

  9329		I feel that deep down you are a very good man.
  9330	Commander: Well..

  9411	Tofu:	I'm serious, Ranma.  Are you ready to die for what you believe in?

  9413	Tofu:	It's all depends on your outlook.  What ever it will be, it will

  9477	[ Ryouga slips off his belt and whips Ranma-chan with it.
  9478	  The force of the blow knocks her down.  Then without missing a beat,
  9479	  Ryouga wraps his belt around her neck and starts choking her. ]
  9480	
  9481	Ryouga:	Die!
  9482	R-chan:	Gasp.. no strength ... too weak ...
  9483	
  9484	[ Soun, in full battle armor,  is attacking Dr. Tofu with a heavy spear ]
  9485	Soun:	Die!
  9486	Tofu:	Please, Mr. Tendo, don't make me hurt you.
  9487	
  9488	[ Mousse is attacking Aih with his throwing weapons ]
  9489	Mousse:	Die! [ amazingly she just gracefully dodges all his attacks ]
  9490	Aih:	Can't you guys say anything else? 
  9491		[ she flips out three spatulas and throws them expertly at him ]
  9492	Mousse:	[ blocking them all ] The fight is just beginning!
  9493	Aih:	I couldn't agree more.
  9494	[ Her initial attack was but a diversion, Aih gets in close and hits him
  9495	  right in the face with an open palm.  The impact is so great it knocks
  9496	  Mousse's glasses off and Mousse for a loop. ]
  9497		Aih-Smash!
  9498	
  9499	Mousse:	What.. hit me?
  9500	
  9501	Purple:	The fight is even so far, but that will change when I..
  9502	Stranger: [ getting up ] Wait.. I'm not finished speaking yet...
  9503	Purple:	[ ignoring him ] Where are the Fang Troopers?!
  9504		What's taking them so long to get here?
  9505		
  9506	[ in answer to his question, a low echoing voice fills the room, all
  9507	  combatants stop their fighting and listen ]
  9508	Voice:	I am the Itch you cannot Scratch..
  9509			[ PurpleCoat starts stamping his foot ]
  9510		I am the Cooking Oil that fries you alive...
  9511			[ The Strike Commander stares at his burnt finger ]
  9512		I am...
  9513	[ With a giantic explosion of smoke, a figure in blue robes appears,
  9514	  he's wearing the faceplate of.. ]
  9515		..FireWater!
  9516	
  9517	Happosai: And his sidekick Happosai!
  9518		[ He's appears beside FW wearing a blue cape and mask ]
  9519	
  9520	FireWater:	While you Fang aristocrats were in here, we destroyed
  9521		the roof of this building.  Right now, all your vampire forces are
  9522		being dissolved by the late afternoon sun.
  9523	
  9524	Purple:	FireWater!  I had hoped that you had somehow survived..
  9525		so that I could kill you with my own bare claws!
  9526	
  9527	Stranger:	Wait!  I am your opponent!  Come back!
  9528	
  9529	Purple:	[ He leaps up to FW, and is about to gives a mighty blow towards
  9530		his chest, FW confidently braces himself ] 
  9531		<CLANG!>  OW... My fist...!
  9532	
  9533	[ FW swings his right arm and slams a chain into PurpleCoat, knocking him
  9534	  down.  He takes out his right arm, beneath his robes.  He has a shiny
  9535	  metal shield attached to it]
  9536	
  9537	FW:	Do you know what these are, old friend?
  9538	Purple:	What.. the weapons.. But that's impossible!
  9539	FW:	Things have changed, PC.  Happy, take out the roof!
  9540	Purple:	No!
  9541	
  9542	[ PurpleCoat leaps back into battle, the two clash between his razor
  9543	fingernails and FW's newly acquired weapons ]
  9544	
  9545	Happosai:	Happosai FireCracker!
  9546	Stranger:	Happosai!  At last I've found you!
  9547	
  9548	[ The stranger takes the canister and crushes it over his head.
  9549	  Then he throws off his robe.  
  9550	  Suddenly he grows into a winged Minotaur with Octopus arms ]
  9551	
  9552	Happosai:	Panty-hose Tarou!  Long time no see..
  9553	
  9554	[ In response the Minotaur just growls.  Happosai throws his bombs at him
  9555	  but he just throws them back.  Happosai quickly recovers and concentrates
  9556	  to grow to his Giant form.  Soon the two are locked in a titanic
  9557	  struggle, amazingly the ceiling remains undamaged.  Normally  Panty-hose
  9558	  Tarou could not stand up against Happosai, but right now Happosai 
  9559	  isn't up to his peak strength, he has been imprisoned, starved and
  9560	  isolated from girls for a long time.  It's an even fight  ]
  9561	
  9562	FW:	You are a fool to challenge my power now!
  9563		[ slams PurpleCoat with another swipe of the chain ]
  9564	
  9565	Purple: ARGHH!!!  The weapons, my powers can't directly affect them.
  9566		I need another tool.  Ryouga, assist me!
  9567	
  9568	[ Ryouga leaves the semi-conscous Ranma-chan dazed on the floor ]
  9569	
  9570	Ryouga:	Roaring Lion's Bullet!
  9571	
  9572	[ The blast of energy shears toward FW.  He puts up his shield to block,
  9573	  which protects him from the worst of the blast.  But the raw energy is
  9574	  too much as his robes are blown away ]
  9575	
  9576	Ryouga:	Eh?!
  9577	
  9578	[ When the energy bolt dies down, the figure is cluctching the shield and
  9579	  chain for dear life, but other than having his clothing blown away,
  9580	  FireWater seems no more worse for wear.  Strangely enough, he has the
  9581	  body of a very attractive young girl with long brown hair dressed in
  9582	  nothing but a now tattered and revealing blue shirt and the faceplate. 
  9583	  She was wearing elevated shoes to give the illusion of being 6'5''  ]
  9584	
  9585	Purple:	...!
  9586	FW:	[ recovering ] Uh, now you know my true form.  But no matter,
  9587		with this arrow of power, I shall smite victory!
  9588		[ Draws a silver arrow with a bow ]
  9589	Purple:	Nooo! [ he's still to weak from the chain beating to stop her ]
  9590	
  9591	Happosai:	Sensei!  I never knew you were so cute!
  9592		[ He returns to his normal form and jumps to his sensei,
  9593		hugging her silky legs ]
  9594	FW:	Happy!  You fool, let go..!
  9595	
  9596	[ Panse Tarou sees his chance and swipes them both with a massive blow from
  9597	  his tentacles.  Happy flies through a reinforced window, not being strong
  9598	  enough to withstand the impact.  Panse Tarou follows, making an even
  9599	  bigger hole than before.  FireWater is thrown into a wall, with a gasp of
  9600	  pain she drops her  weapons and her faceplate is knocked off.  As it
  9601	  skids across the floor,  we see her face. ]
  9602	
  9603	Ukyou:	My head... swimming... Stop the teleportation spell,
  9604		or all is lost.. [ falls unconscious ]
  9605	
  9606	[ But everyone has other concerns ]
  9607	
  9608	Purple:	Sun-light!  Someone seal that hole!
  9609	 
  9610	Commader: You are brave, boy, but no match for me.
  9611	[ He has defeated Kay.  Now freed of any distraction, he uses his levitation
  9612	  powers to seal off the hole Panty-hose Taro made.  This is taking several
  9613	  minutes ]
  9614	
  9615	[ Dr. Tofu, being defensive, is suffering from a gaping spear wound while
  9616	  Soun advances.  Likewise, Aih has no match for Mousse's melee weapons,
  9617	  despite her initial attacks ]
  9618	
  9619	Ranma-chan: [ searching Panse Tarou's discarded cloak desperately ]
  9620		Here, I knew I'd find one!  [ picks up a canister ]
  9621		And it's warm [ feeling it ]
  9622		[ He empties the contents over himself, a small puff of steam forms
  9623		  as he transforms back to a man ]
  9624	Ranma:	Now to help the others..
  9625	
  9626	[ Ranma throws two more vials, one at Ryouga and the other at Mousse.
  9627	  Ryouga, too shocked at the revelation of Ukyou while Mousse is to too
  9628	  engrossed with his battle with Aih, don't see the canisters coming.  They
  9629	  both transform into their relatively harmless forms.  Aih slaps Mousse
  9630	  again and knocks him into P-chan.  They both are knocked unconscious. ]
  9631	
  9632	
  9633	Ranma:	Now, face the full power of Saotome Ranma!
  9634		Crackling-Fire-Speed-Fist!
  9635	Soun:	Eh?  OOF! [ falls before Ranma's 100 punch/sec strike ]
  9636	Aih:	Ranma, thank you..
  9637	Ranma:	Who's next?!
  9638	Tofu:	Ranma.. you just hit Mr. Soun.  Something you would have never done
  9639		before...
  9640	Ranma:	Mr. Soun.. my second father...
  9641	Tofu:	Ranma, don't lose to your Dark Half again..
  9642	
  9643	Ranma:	[ angry ] It's all your're fault!
  9644	Purple:	Ranma.. [ recovering ] you don't want to fight us.
  9645	Ranma:  You killed my father!
  9646	Purple:	No, you're father is alive.
  9647	Ranma:	What?!  You lie!  I remember killing him... [ voice trails off ]
  9648	Purple:	No, he lives.  That was only a vampire transformed into a Panda.
  9649	Ranma:	My father.. is alive?
  9650	Purple:	Yes, he's alive and he's right here.
  9651	Ranma:	What?  Where?
  9652	Purple:	Oh, very close, in fact [ takes off his hat ], I am your father!
  9653		[ It's Genma! ]
  9654	Ranma:	No..No..! [ clutching his head ]
  9655	Genma:	Ranma, why are you trying to kill me again?
  9656	Ranma:	I.. you.. He.. But...  IT'S A LIE!
  9657	Genma:	No, search your feelings, you know it's true.
  9658		I never told you, I wanted to protect you from my life.
  9659		But now I see that was a mistake.
  9660	Ranma:	It's a lie, please let it be a lie...
  9661	Genma:	Join me, son!  You are powerful!  Even the Strike Commander fears
  9662		you, we can rule the Fang Empire together, Father and Son!
  9663	Ranma:	...No... I don't believe you...
  9664	Genma:	Ranma...
  9665	
  9666	Ranma:	I HATE you!  You ran out on me, making me believe I killed you!
  9667		[ throws a canister at Genma ]
  9668	Genma?:	Wah!  Cold!
  9669	Ranma:	I knew it, still human.  I'll kill you!
  9670	
  9671	Purple:	Well, if this form is unpleasing to you, I can change to another.
  9672		[ starts shimmering into another form ]
  9673	
  9674	Ranma:	I'm won't be fooled by any more of your transformations!
  9675	
  9676	Purple:	I know all about you, Ranma.  Your strengths and weaknesses.
  9677		I really did admire you, I'm sorry it had to end this way.
  9678	
  9679	Ranma:	Save your threats for school girls...
  9680		[ Purple transforms into a Giant Ghost Cat ]
  9681		...ARGHH!!! Keep away from me!
  9682	
  9683	[ The GhostCat pounces at Ranma, but Ranma runs off too fast.
  9684	  The chase goes on for a little while until Ranma, not watching where he
  9685	  is going, crashes into the reinforced window. ]
  9686	
  9687	Ranma:	Uh...
  9688	Commander: And I just fixed it.
  9689	Purple:	Nooo!  More sun-light!!  [ collapses ]
  9690	
  9691	Aih:	You're our last hope, Saotome Ranma.
  9692	Tofu:	Go Ranma, we can't help anymore, we're too weak..
  9693	Kay:	Fight and win for us, Ranma...
  9694	Ukyou:	Go Ran-chan.. Stop the teleportation...  
  9695	
  9696	[ They all fall unconscious due to their injuries ]
  9697	Ranma:	Ucc-chan...
  9698	
  9699	[ Before she collapses, Ukyou points to beyond the end of the chamber.  In
  9700	  it is a woman in pitch  black robes in the middle of casting some huge
  9701	  spell. ] 
  9702	
  9703	Commander: [ who has just finished repairing the window... AGAIN ]
  9704		It's just you and me now, Ranma.
  9705	Ranma:	Stand aside!  I have to stop that teleportation spell!
  9706		The safety of the city depends on it!
  9707	Commander:	You little niave fool.  How much you do not know.
  9708	Ranma:	I said move it!  [ He jumps towards him ]
  9709	Commander:	Stop!  You cannot approach me!
  9710	Ranma:	Says who?!  [ gets pounded by flying debris ]
  9711	Commander:	You cannot come near me with my power.
  9712	Ranma:	Fine then, if I can't touch you..  Roaring Lion's Bullet!
  9713	
  9714	[ Ranma sends a beam of energy at the Commander, but he blocks with
  9715	the palm of his hand ]
  9716	
  9717	Commander:	You have to do better than that.
  9718	Ranma:	Roaring Lion's Bullet!
  9719	[ Ranma repeated fires, but he can't bypass the Commander's defense ]
  9720	
  9721	Ukyou:	Ran-chan...	[ resisting unconsciousness ]
  9722	Tofu:	Ranma... 	[ holding on to his wounded arm ]
  9723	Aih:	Ranma..		[ pushing herself up against a wall ]
  9724	Kay:	Ranma...	[ stirring from unconsciousness ]
  9725	Ranma:	Blast, there has to be some way..
  9726	
  9727	[ Flashback ]
  9728	Genma:	Ranma, the whole point of this exercise is to learn the
  9729		Cat-fist techinique.  When up against a foe more stronger than you,
  9730		it is important to know as many fighting styles as possible.
  9731		This way you can combine your attacks to make an unbeatable offense!
  9732	
  9733	Little Ranma:	No!  I hate cats!  Not again!
  9734	
  9735	Genma:	We will continue training until we get it right!
  9736		[ drops little Ranma into a cat pit ]
  9737	
  9738	[ Present ]
  9739	Ranma:	That's it!  Saotome Meteor-Shower Punch!
  9740		[ he lets out a huge blast of energy ]
  9741	Commander:	HA!  I can stop even this energy manifistation...  ULP!
  9742	Tofu:	What?  One got through!
  9743	Commander:	How...
  9744	Ranma:	I'm combining my techniques.  I'm hitting so fast, you can't hope
  9745		to defend yourself.
  9746	Commander:	You can't defeat me with this cheap trick!
  9747	Ranma:	Fine, let's do it again!
  9748		Roaring Lion's Crackling Fire Bullet Speed Fist!
  9749		( let's keep it to Meteor-Shower Punch, it's shorter )
  9750	[ Ranma lets out a combination of his two techniques.
  9751	  100 energy bolts fly out towards his target ]
  9752	
  9753	Commander:	Impossible!  UHHH!! [ gets clobbered by several blows ]
  9754	
  9755	Ukyou:	Ran-chan!
  9756	Tofu:	Ranma!
  9757	
  9758	Ranma:	Had enough?
  9759	Commander:	Fu.  Your blows, when seperated like this, lack strength.
  9760			I would image you must be near exhaustion as well.
  9761	Ranma:	Pant..Pant.. He's right.
  9762	Commander:	I only have to delay for another moment, and then the
  9763		Leader shall come with the Elite Guard!  We shall crush you...
  9764		UGHH! My chest.. [ clutching the first wound caused by Ranma ]
  9765	Ranma:	Don't have much time, I have to take him out NOW!
  9766	Ukyou:	Ranma, catch! [ she throws him a bow and the silver arrow ]
  9767	Commander:	The ancient weapons!
  9768			My power can't affect them...
  9769	Ukyou:	Hurry, Ran-chan, this weapon has power enough to kill him!
  9770	Ranma:	Prepare for the end! [ takes careful aim ]
  9771	Commander: No!
  9772	
  9773	Kasumi:	What's all the noise?
  9774		[ She arrives carrying a plate of food to the Commander ]
  9775	Commander:	Do you dare fire now? [ He grabs her ]
  9776	Kasumi:	Kazuya-san, not in front of the children..
  9777		[ He places her right in front of him ]
  9778	Ranma:	Whoops! [ almost fires the arrow but just stops himself ]
  9779	Tofu:	Kasumi!
  9780	Kasumi:	Eh?  Dr. Tofu..
  9781	Kay:	Ranma...
  9782	Aih:	Ranma...
  9783	Ukyou:	Ran-chan, hurry, it's almost too late!
  9784	Tofu:	Ranma!  If you miss...
  9785	Ranma:	Forgive me Kasumi... [ takes aim again ]
  9786		But I'm afraid I'm going to do a lot worse before the end of the day.
  9787	Commander:	You're crazy!  Stop!
  9788	Kasumi:	Kazuya-san...
  9789	Tofu:	Kasumi!
  9790	Ranma:	Ummmm! [ Ranma pulls back on the bow and lets the arrow fly ]
  9791	Kay:	Ranma!
  9792	Aih:	Ranma!
  9793	Commander:	No!!  I can't do it!
  9794	
  9795	[ He quickly pushes Kasumi behind him, the silver shaft embeds in his heart ]
  9796	
  9797	Kasumi:	Kazuya-san!
  9798	Commander: Kasumi-san, Thank you for your cooking.  It smells wonderful.
  9799		I'm sorry I didn't have a chance to taste it...
  9800	Kasumi:	Kazuya-san...  Kazuya-san!!! [ shaking him, no response ]
  9801		...
  9802	
  9803	Ukyou:	Hurry!  It's almost too late!
  9804	
  9805	[ Ranma and the rest, suddenly rejuvenated with the possibility victory tap
  9806	  into their reserves and run towards the spellcaster.
  9807	  Just as they reach her, they are  all blown back by a burst of air. ]
  9808	
  9809	Purple:	[ in pain ] The Leader... is here!   Hahahaha.. cough cough ouch..
  9810	
  9811	[ A figure in tattered brown robes walks in ]
  9812	Leader:	THIS IS MY WELCOMING?  I AM VERY DISPLEASED.
  9813	Aih:	You're going to be even more displeased than that!
  9814	Leader:	SILENCE!  I SEE MY AGENTS HAVE FAILED.  NO MATTER.
  9815		I SHALL DEAL WITH THIS MYSELF.
  9816	[ From the Leader's fingertips, bolts of lightening fly out and strike
  9817	  everyone down. ]
  9818	
  9819	Kasumi:	[ watching nearby ] The others, they need me..
  9820		I can't let this bother me.. Not now.. 
  9821		Mother...
  9822	
  9823	Ranma:	I'm not finished yet..! [ struggling to get up ]
  9824	
  9825	Leader:	WHAT STRENGTH, WHAT DETERMINATION!  I SHALL ENJOY BREAKING YOU.
  9826	
  9827	Ranma:	Never...!  ARGH!! [ gets blasted again ]
  9828	
  9829	Leader:	I AM A GOD.  I AM ALL POWERFUL.  YOU CAN NOT STOP ME.
  9830	Ranma:	What's the big deal about being a god?!
  9831		Saotome Meteor-Shower Punch! [ rains force-bolts at the Leader ]
  9832	
  9833	[ But the leader just blocks them all with a protective energy field ]
  9834	
  9835	Leader:	YOU FOOL.
  9836	Ranma:	ARGHH!
  9837	[ Ranma is constantly blasted by lightening from the Leader's fingertips,
  9838	  over and over again.  But Ranma refuses to give up and advances slowly,
  9839	  painfully and very costily ]
  9840	
  9841		Father.. help me...
  9842	
  9843	Leader:	CALL OUT TO YOUR ANCESTORS, THEY CAN NOT HELP YOU NOW.
  9844	
  9845	[ Flashback ]
  9846	Genma:	Ranma, this our secret technique:
  9847		Sometimes you have to run away in order to defeat your enemy.
  9848		It's something they never expect.
  9849	
  9850	[ Present ]
  9851	
  9852	Leader:	DIE!
  9853	Ranma:	Saotome Secret!
  9854	Leader:	WHAT?!
  9855	Ranma:	Some tricks always work.
  9856	
  9857	[ The Leader sens a massive bolt of energy at Ranma.  Ranma, instead of
  9858	  facing it, this time retreats and easily avoids the path of the bolt.
  9859	  He jumps around and bounces off a side wall and lands near the Leader ]
  9860	
  9861	Leader:	WHERE?
  9862	Ranma:	Here I come!
  9863	Kasumi:	Ranma!  Watch out for the cross fire!
  9864	Leader:	EH?!  THAT FACE...?!
  9865	[ At that moment's distraction, Ranma manages to belt the Leader right in
  9866	  the breadbasket ]
  9867	
  9868	Ranma:	Gotcha!
  9869	Leader:	OOF!!  YOU DARE STRIKE ME?!  YOU WILL PAY FOR THAT!
  9870		[ The smell of ozone starts filling the area ]
  9871	
  9872	[ Pan back to the outskirts of Kunou Manor.
  9873	  Despite the activities going on, it remains a beautiful sunny day.
  9874	  The scene slowly pans back to the city.  Despite all the deaths,
  9875	  the city is still busy, hustling, going on with it's everyday business,
  9876	  oblivious to the cosmic struggle going on between good and evil.
  9877	  Pan back to show the country of Japan just sitting serenely in the sea.
  9878	  Pan back again to show the earth, a great blue dot of hope in space ]
  9879	
  9880	"FIGHT ON RANMA!  GOD IS WITH YOU!"
  9881	
  9882	[ Then we hear Ranma's cries of pain echoing across the globe. ]

  9887	Character Profile:	Lo-shin (Lotion)
  9888		A young girl from Shampoo's village.  She appears to be slightly
  9889	younger than Shampoo and also very good friends with every one from the
  9890	village.  She is a very liberated '90s type girl, not wishing to conform to
  9891	the old customs of the village, especially the mating ritual.  But she's
  9892	still dreams of finding Mr. Right.  Lo-shin is also a bit more impulsive
  9893	and belligerent than Shampoo and seems to enjoy fighting very much.  She
  9894	also has less compulsions against killing or maiming.
  9895		Considering her residence, she is highly skilled in the fighting
  9896	arts, although she personally knows no special or magical techniques, she
  9897	is still a VERY strong fighter and has lots of potential.  Her specialty is
  9898	wtih throwing weapons, she can make simply incredible shots.   Her hair
  9899	braid is made up a steel braid, spiked on one end.  She keeps little
  9900	weapons like these all over her body hidden as ornaments.
  9901	
  9902	Physcial Description:
  9903		A cute chinese girl about 16 yrs old.  She dresses similarly to
  9904	Shampoo.  She has bright blue hair arranged in a long braid-pony-tail.  She
  9905	sort of looks like a cross between Ranma-chan and Shampoo.  She looks a bit
  9906	younger than Shampoo but more exotic/foreign than Ranma-chan.

  9938	Very Brief synopsis
  9939		I don't think you would want me to hold off posting because I
  9940	didn't wan't to get around writing a long detailed summary, so here is a
  9941	very short one:
  9942	
  9943		The final battle between the forces of Furinkan High and the
  9944	supernatural hordes of the Fang nears it's climax.  The sinister Fang
  9945	Spell-caster, using her last remaining strength has summoned their supreme
  9946	Leader for the final fight.  Casualties are heavily amassed by both sides.
  9947	The last confict now stands as Ranma must defeat the Leader of the Fang
  9948	Empire, who are both the last remaining champions of either side, still
  9949	standing.  Victory seemed hopeless until Ranma scored a palable hit on the 
  9950	invincible Leader, giving hope to an otherwise hopeless cause. 
  9951	-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
  9952	
  9953	[ Opens up with Ranma being knocked for a big loop as a massive
  9954	lightening bolt hits him in the chest.  He lies panting and lying on the
  9955	ground.  Likewise Dr. Tofu, Ukyou, Kay and Aih are just struggling to keep
  9956	awake, suffering from their massive injuries during the last encounter.
  9957	Kasumi watches idly nearby ] 
  9958	
  9959	Kasumi:	Is this more special training?
  9960	
  9961	Leader:	WHY DO YOU CONTINUE TO RESIST?
  9962		EVERY time YOU get UP I just KNOCK you DOWN.
  9963		YOU can BARELY stand MUCH less FIRE another KI-blast.
  9964		
  9965	Ranma:	Nothing will stop me.
  9966		I'll fight you with the last bit of my strength! 
  9967		Knock me down 1000 times!  It won't matter,
  9968		I'll keep coming until I win!
  9969	
  9970	Leader:	VERY well then, GET up so I CAN knock you DOWN again
  9971		with MY lightening bolts.
  9972	Ranma:	Uhhh!  Give me a minute... Ummf!
  9973	
  9974	Leader:	WIMP.  PurpleCoat, where are YOU?
  9975	Purple:	[ weakly ] Here, my liege.. UGHH! [ gets blasted by the Leader ]
  9976		What was that for?!
  9977	Leader: I HEARD that comment about RULING my empire with SAOTOME.
  9978	Purple:	It was only a delaying tactic.
  9979		I have served you loyally in the past..
  9980	Leader: I KNOW, that's why you're STILL alive.
  9981		[ Ranma is still trying to get up ]
  9982		Are the MAIDENS of the selection READY?
  9983		I hope you PICKED some pretty ones THIS time.
  9984	Purple:	My leige, your voice, it becomes not unlike static.
  9985	Leader:	OH, blast, he's shorted OUT my speaker system WITH his punch.
  9986		Better shut it off.
  9987	
  9988	Ranma:	[ still struggling to get up, almost there ]
  9989		You fiend!  I won't let you have them..!
  9990	
  9991	Leader:	Oh, I will have them.  They're all going to be mine.
  9992	
  9993	Ranma:	Wait, something about your voice...
  9994		
  9995	[ The Leader takes off the hood of her cloak to reveal the face of a
  9996	  young and suprisingly cute girl.  She has clear blue innocent eyes,
  9997	  light aqua-olive hair and incredibly adorable fangs. ]
  9998	
  9999	Ranma:	You're a .. girl!
 10000	Leader: Gee, you noticed.  You probably thought the supreme Leader of the
 10001		Fang Empire just had to be a guy, didn't you?  Typical male.
 10002	Ranma:	You mean.., you enjoy girls?!
 10003		[ gets zapped for that comment, ed note: that one he deserved ]
 10004	
 10005	Purple:	Empress, I see you've taken yet another host.
 10006	Empress: Do you like it? [ strikes a sensuous pose ]
 10007	Purple:	[ looking her up and down, sweating ] Uhh, what if I say no?
 10008	Empress: I'll zap you.
 10009	Purple:	What if I say yes? [ gets zapped ]
 10010	Empress: Sex-maniac!  I could feel your hot eyes slobbering all over me!
 10011		 Know your place, servant!
 10012	Kasumi:	She's so cute!
 10013	
 10014	Empress: Ranma, Darr-ling!  Why don't you join me?
 10015		You obviously have potential, even if you are a little crude.
 10016		You could serve me very well under the Fang.
 10017	
 10018	Ranma:	Never! 
 10019	Empress: Don't you find me attractive? [ smile! ]
 10020	Ranma:	Don't try to hypnotise me...
 10021	Empress: I'm not.
 10022	Ranma:	... uh... [ starts to look confused ]
 10023	Empress: And you don't have a bad face..
 10024	Ranma:	Umm.. [ now starts smiling  ] ..Actually no.
 10025	Empress: Eh?
 10026	Ranma:	I'm not interested in girls who have less sex appeal than me.
 10027	Empress: ...
 10028	Purple:	Empress, if you'll just give me a minute, I need to update you
 10029		on some info..
 10030	Ranma:	In fact, you're bratty and obnoxious!
 10031	Empress: WHAT?!
 10032	
 10033			*		*		*
 10034		In a chamber, the Fang Healing Tanks set up by the Strike Commander
 10035	himself, start shaking.  The water soon comes to a rapid boil.  Bubbles and
 10036	mist start eminating  from the once gentle waters of healing.  The water
 10037	gets worse as the tanks start cracking.
 10038	
 10039	Vamp Guard 1:	What, the pools.. ARGH! [ gets splashed ]
 10040	Vamp Guard 1:	It's becoming like Fire...!
 10041	
 10042	[ The tanks explode and the vampires are consumed by the boiling fiery
 10043	  water.  A cry of triumph erupts as the explosive water smashes into the
 10044	  adjoining walls ]
 10045			*		*		*
 10046	
 10047	Ranma:	You're not cute!  You're not cute! [ ZAAAPP!!!]
 10048		Uhh... Maybe this wasn't such a great idea..
 10049	Empress: So if you won't join me, you have to fight me.
 10050		What are you going to do now?  Hit a girl?!
 10051	Ranma:	Well I uh... [ gets clobbered by another lightening bolt ]
 10052		GRR!!  I already hit you once, another time won't matter!
 10053		And you're no girl!  No person with that much lack of sex appeal
 10054		can be a girl! 
 10055	Empress: [ lighting up like New Year's ] You'll pay for that!
 10056	Ranma:	Who's going to make me?
 10057	Green:	Me!
 10058		[ He flies in and hits Ranma on the back of his head ]
 10059	Purple:	GreenCoat..!
 10060	Green:	Sorry, guys, but I owe him.
 10061	Purple:	I thought you..
 10062	Green:	Died?  C'mon, you didn't REALLY think I bit it.
 10063		But I'll admit I was pretty messed up, I think I broke a neck bone.
 10064	Purple:	No, I thought you were loafing off duty again.  I was wondering
 10065		when you were going to haul your lazy carcass here.
 10066	
 10067	Green:	I missed you too.  Anyway, I've got important information.  I was
 10068		meaning to tell you, but some sort of invasion force always came
 10069		up.  Remember my investigation for the lost body of Kuonji?  I
 10070		found out Jo is some how animating Kuonji Ukyou's body.  His scent
 10071		is the most recent one at the place where her body was last seen.
 10072		Most likely she'll try to use the ancient weapons under his mental
 10073		instruction. 
 10074	
 10075	Purple:	Your report is a little late.
 10076	Green:	There was something else too, but I just can't seem to remember..
 10077	
 10078	[ By now Ukyou, Dr. Tofu Kay and Aih are stuggling to their feet. ]
 10079	
 10080	Tofu:	Stop..!
 10081	Ukyou:	No one hurts Ran-chan..!
 10082	
 10083	Green:	Hey, there's Kuonji.  But she sure doesn't talk like Jo.
 10084		A lot cuter though.  But where is that other one..?
 10085	
 10086	Empress: The common fighters.  You are not worthy of my attention.
 10087		I'll let my elite guard handle you.
 10088		Rise, my Guard of Four!
 10089	
 10090	[ From behind the Empress, four figures jump out ]
 10091	
 10092		Loin-cloth!
 10093	[ A large Fang Warrior in a furry loin-cloth lets out a huge bellow ]
 10094	
 10095		Needle!
 10096	[ A man with a rapier leaps out, preforming a series of sword thrusts ]
 10097	
 10098		Buttons!
 10099	[ A tall thin man wearing glasses comes up, strangely enough he has buttons
 10100	  on his shirt and pants, even on his eyeglasses. ]
 10101	
 10102		and, "George"
 10103	[ A normal looking kid with freckles in a school uniform walks up ]
 10104	George:	Hi!
 10105	
 10106	Ranma:	[ struggling to his feet ] Heh, I'm not afraid of your wimpires..
 10107	
 10108	Empress:  Attack them, my Guard of Four!
 10109			*		*		*
 10110	
 10111	[ In the crystal chamber where the crystal maidens sleep, their
 10112	  serene slumber is brought to a rude awakening as the wall slowly suddenly
 10113	  bursts open and unrelenting water floods the room.  The water carries the
 10114	  crystal coffins and smashes them into the wall. ]
 10115	
 10116	Akane:	cough cough where am I?
 10117	Nabiki:	Ugh.. Akane?
 10118	Akane:	Sister...
 10119	Shampoo: Where?..
 10120	Akane:	Shampoo!  Easy, it's going to be alright.
 10121	
 10122	[ Shampoo grabs Akane's arm and throws her against the wall ]
 10123	
 10124	Shampoo: Yes, it certainly will. [ Her eyes glow red ]
 10125	Kodachi: We are not going anywhere.
 10126	Loshin:	Surrender.
 10127	
 10128			*		*		*
 10129	
 10130	[ Back to the main council chambers.  It is a masacre.  The good guys lost.
 10131	  Their battered and wounded force is no match for the Empress's fresh
 10132	  personal guard.
 10133	
 10134	Green:	[ munching on  some popcorn ]
 10135		Wow, you almost never get to see fights like this.
 10136	Purple:	Hmm. 
 10137	
 10138	Ranma:	Okay, now I'm afraid.
 10139	Loin-cloth:	You all die now.
 10140	Aih:	Blast, these guys are too powerful..
 10141		We need strong.. really strong reinforcements..
 10142	Buttons: Prepare for the end!
 10143	
 10144	[ And then the chamber doors slam open once again.  This time the doors flies
 10145	  straight like missles and slam into Lion-cloth, crashing him into the
 10146	  wall.  From the corrider a figure is heard walking down the hall.  He's
 10147	  also whistling some tune: TweetTweet, Tweet-tweet-tweet-tweet-TweetTweet ]
 10148	
 10149	Voice:	"Those who have sown the winds of destruction must reap the
 10150		whirlwind of justice" 
 10151		[ In walks an ominous seven foot man wearing drenched blue robes ]
 10152	
 10153	Green:	J..Jo, is that you?!
 10154	
 10155	[ The figure walks towards FireWater's faceplate.  With a flick of his foot
 10156	  he tosses it up and catches it in his hand.
 10157	
 10158	Voice:	I'll give you a hint.
 10159	[ He throws it at GreenCoat, which just barely misses and ends up beheading
 10160	  George who was behind him, the faceplate flies in an arc and returns to 
 10161	  his hand.  The interloper places it on the face of his hood. ]
 10162	
 10163	Green:	Yep, it's him alright.  No one else would miss so badly.
 10164	
 10165	Needle:	[ drawing his saber ] We meet again, young FireWalker.
 10166	FireWater: That's FireWaTER!
 10167	Needle:	Oh yeah, it's been a while..
 10168		Defend yourself! [ tries to run him through with his rapier ]
 10169	
 10170	[ FW steps aside, when Needle passes him, FW draws a sword from beneath his
 10171	  cloak and guts Needle ] 
 10172	Needle:	Hey!  You never used hidden weapons before...!  Uhh...
 10173		
 10174	Purple:	Well, Well, Well... If it isn't FireHazard, again.
 10175		Or is it just another one of your dopplegangers, coward?
 10176	FW:	Exploding Point Technique!
 10177		[ stikes the ground with his fist, the ensuing explosion slams
 10178		  PurpleCoat into the ceiling ] 
 10179	Buttons:  It's been a long time, FireWater!
 10180	FW:	Do I know you?
 10181	Buttons: Don't pretend you don't remember!
 10182	FW:	Have we met?
 10183	Buttons: You really don't remember me?  UGH!
 10184		[ gets suckered punched ]
 10185	Green:	I see you haven't lost your touch, Jo.
 10186	FW:	What about you, GC?
 10187		I don't think I've shown you my Cat-Fist technique yet.
 10188		[ raises his arm with his wrist and elbow bent, fingers curled  ]
 10189	Green:	Hahaha!  You've got to be kidding!
 10190		There's no way I'm taking you on by myself. [ steps aside ]
 10191	
 10192	[ FW approaches the Empress ]
 10193	Empress:	Jo?  Jo BlueRobe, darr-ling!  It is you, isn't it?
 10194			It's been ages since we last saw each other.  
 10195	FireWater:	I'm FireWater now.
 10196	Empress:	Oh that's right, after that night you went on that drinking
 10197			binge...   You know you really hurt poor PurpleCoat.
 10198	FireWater:	So have you.  With your electric zaps.
 10199			And he's hurt me, with his claws.
 10200			Other than the new body, you haven't changed a bit..
 10201	Empress:	You have, you no longer spout those silly metaphors,
 10202			but you still like to make a dramatic entrance and
 10203			I always loved your poetry.
 10204	FireWater:	I haven't come for small talk.
 10205			Your personal Guard can't protect you now.
 10206	Empress:	I don't need them, but they're nice to have around when I
 10207			don't want to sully my own two hands.
 10208	FireWater:	Give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now.. 
 10209	Empress:	I'll give you Four.
 10210	
 10211	[ In a roar Loin-cloth tears himself out of the wall and charges into FW.
 10212	  By now the others have recovered and joined the melee, including GreenCoat.
 10213	  However Needle is still painfully trying to pull the sword from his side.
 10214	  George remains dead.
 10215	  The Empress is checking her make-up in a vanity mirror ]
 10216	
 10217			*		*		*
 10218	Akane:	What..
 10219	Nabiki:	Akane, we can't fight them.
 10220	Akane:	But the others, they may be in danger.
 10221	Loshin:		Stop!
 10222	Kodachi:	You are of the chosen selection!
 10223	Shampoo:	Do not move UHHH! [ falls unconscious ]
 10224	Loshin:	Forgive me, friends, for deception. 
 10225		But no other way to knock out Shampoo.  She too strong.
 10226		Go!  Help others, Lo-shin will  keep last Dark-Slave busy!
 10227	
 10228	[ Akane looks at her briefly and then runs off with Nabiki ]
 10229	
 10230	Kodachi:	Girl, you place your life in peril,
 10231			when you challenge, Black-Rose Kodachi!
 10232		[ Throws sharp edged black roses at her ]
 10233	Loshin:	Ahhh! [ gets various minor cuts and scrapes ]
 10234		My face!  This one has had just about enough of you!
 10235		[ She bends down and picks up a crystal shard ]
 10236		HAAA!
 10237	[ She throws the shard at Kodachi.  Kodachi dodges it easily and flings her
 10238	  ribbon to ensnare Lotion's hand. ]
 10239	
 10240	Kodachi: Now I have you!
 10241	
 10242	[ Lotion gives a hard tug and throws Kodachi off balance.  Before she can
 10243	  recover, Lotion runs in and gives an toe kick to her neck.
 10244	  Lotion then applies a headlock to Kodachi.  But Kodachi isn't finished
 10245	  yet, she slips a baton down her arm and rams it into Lotion's stomach. ]
 10246	
 10247	Kodachi:	Feel my righteous anger!
 10248	
 10249	[ Lotion swings her long braided ponytail around.  At the end of her
 10250	  ponytail is a sharp metal clasp.  It bashes Kodachi straight in the face. ]
 10251	
 10252	Kodachi:	You'll pay for that you little...
 10253	
 10254	[ Before she can recover, Loshin uses her momentum to follow up with a
 10255	  round body spin kick which enables her to pick up a crystal shard on the
 10256	  ground and simultaneously offensively kick Kodachi in the kissser.  In a last
 10257	  ditch attempt for her to recapture the offense, Kodachi throws a hoop
 10258	  straight at Lotion's head. ]    
 10259	
 10260	Kodachi:	I'm through playing with you!
 10261	
 10262	[ Lotion jumps through the loop and hooks her feet at one end and with a
 10263	  sommersault throws it back at an astonished Kodachi.  She barely avoids
 10264	  the return and is stunned by the near miss.  Lying on the ground, she can
 10265	  only watch as Lotion calmly walks up to her, as silent as ever. ]  
 10266	(ed note: I hope you guys appreciate all the detail I'm giving you!)
 10267	
 10268	Lo-shin: "The true warrior boasts with HER body, not with HIS mouth."
 10269	Kodachi: Spare me your stupid chinese proverbs.
 10270	
 10271	[ Kodachi tries to get up, but before she can move too far, Lotion slams
 10272	the crystal shard she was holding, right into her heart. ]
 10273	
 10274	Loshin:	"Rest in pieces, harlot!"  That one is western proverb.

 10296	Seiya's voice:	If you're in a helpless situation, I'd drop everything to
 10297			save you.  And I don't mind getting rough, the more I'm
 10298			hurt, the better I like it.
 10299	Char's voice:	For you, I'd destroy whole planets.

 10312		Hello, My name is Nausicaa, I'm a princess from a faraway magical
 10313	land.  But we still face the same real life problems.  I just want to talk
 10314	to you about the environment.  The way people are going, we're going to
 10315	destroy the whole world.  The amount of trash and toxins we're producing is
 10316	alarming.  But if you can't think of your own people then think about the
 10317	innocent animals and insects.  We don't own Earth, we're sharing it with
 10318	every other living being.  And some of them aren't just going to sit idly
 10319	by and take this abuse.  It's time we took care of Mother Earth.  Something
 10320	to think about.  Recycle, it really helps.  
 10321	
 10322	[ Commercial C ]
 10323		At Sizzle's, not only do we offer a great steak and seafood platter
 10324	combo, but we also have an all-you-can-eat salad bar and popcorn shrimp.

 10326	
 10327	Ataru:	Hey Waiter!  More Shrimp!  More Shrimp!
 10328	Rei:	GULP! CHOMP!  SLURP! EAT! SWALLOW!

 10338	[ Back at the council chambers, the good guys are losing badly.
 10339	  Even FireWater's added power isn't enough to turn the tide of battle.
 10340	  Needle has managed to get to his feet but has not joined the fight.
 10341	  Not like he really needs to.
 10342	  George is still dead, his head decapitated from his body while
 10343	  The Emperess has moved on to eyeshadow coloring. ]

 10347	[ In the meanwhile, LoinCloth has FW bent down in a headlock, PurpleCoat is
 10348	  slashing him with his claws, GreenCoat is biting on his leg and Buttons
 10349	  is kicking him in the stomach.  In a burst of blue aura, FW breaks free,
 10350	  but then LoinCloth quickly grabs him from behind and does a backdrop on
 10351	  him.  As FW struggles up, stars are circling his head and he does his
 10352	  impression of a drunk man.
 10353	  However they are doing a pretty impressive amount of property damage. ]

 10356	Everyone:	HUH?!
 10357	Kasumi:	This is not how you treat a guest's house!
 10358		I won't forgive you!
 10359	Buttons: Woman, how dare you disturb the natural progression of the Empress's 
 10360		holy Guard of Four?!  For that sacrilege I will be forced to..
 10361	
 10362	[ Kasumi reaches into her pocket and takes out... ]

 10366	Fang:	Cooking BEANS+?!! ARGHH!  Back!  Fall Back!
 10367	Purple:	She can't keep this up!
 10368		There's only so many beans she has in her apron!
 10369	Green:	Ouch!  Those things sting!
 10370	
 10371	FireWater: This may be the chance we've been looking for..!
 10372		Aih, carry Kay's body outside now.
 10373	Aih:	Okay..
 10374	FW:	Dr. Tofu, I want you to grab Kasumi and run out of this room when
 10375		she runs out of beans.  Seal the doors afterwards.
 10376	Tofu:	But how will I...
 10377	FW:	Ukyou, give Officer Kay the platinum dart, I know you have it on you.
 10378		[ touching Kay's head ]  There, that should do it.
 10379	Tofu:	But what about..
 10380	FW:	Ranma, you already know the Dragon Cyclone technique..
 10381	Ranma:	Yeah.. but..
 10382	FW:	Ukyou, you still have a fraction of my consciousness within you.
 10383	Ukyou:	... Yes.
 10384	FW:	Good, this is our chance to turn the tide of battle...
 10385		We three are going to combine our power.  This is the formation...
 10386		
 10387	[ Ranma jumps on top of FW's shoulders, Ukyou does likewise to Ranma's ]
 10388	
 10389	Ukyou:	"Twirling Whirlwind!"
 10390	FW:	Theoretically this should work.
 10391	Ranma:	Theoretically?!
 10392	
 10393	[ On cue their allies run out.  Then the threesome focus their energies
 10394	into a single cyclone manifistation ]
 10395	
 10396	Green:	Hey, is there a breeze in here?
 10397	
 10398	[ The three start spinning in place, faster and faster.  Soon a powerful
 10399	  whirlwind stands in their place and is growing! ]
 10400	
 10401	Needle:	Whoa!
 10402	
 10403	[ All the Fang are thrown around like rag dolls in the a hurricane ]

 10406	Purple:	Ridiculous!
 10407	
 10408	FW:	Now!
 10409	
 10410	[ The three stop the techinique and jump out of their formation like
 10411	speeding bullets.  Each rams into a Fang and sends them gasping in pain.
 10412	FireWater is just amazing as he flies around his opponents.  And the way he
 10413	leaps into the air, he looks like a frightening dark Bird of Prey ]
 10414	
 10415	Green:	Hey!  That's my line!
 10416	
 10417	FW:	Quick, Ranma, keep them busy while I take out the ceiling!
 10418	
 10419	Ranma:	Gotcha, man!
 10420	
 10421	FW:	Winged Griffin Pounce!!!
 10422	[ a large blue griffin aura surrounds him.  As he reaches up for the
 10423	  ceiling, the Griffin image follows and  smashes a big hole ]
 10424	
 10425	Purple:	Sun-light!
 10426	Green:	Thanks for the update, Purple,
 10427		but I think we can all see that for ourselves.
 10428	
 10429	[ All the Fang start disintegrating except for .. ]
 10430	
 10431	Green:	Oh come on you sissies.  Just 10 minutes more and the
 10432		sun's going to set.  Be a man and take it.
 10433	Needle:	Sun-light is sun-light, you fool...
 10434	Purple:	Hey, wait a minute, why aren't you affected?!
 10435	Green:	And you all made fun of me for getting such an expensive custom
 10436		designed suit.  It's made of special ultra-violent radiation
 10437		reflective materials.  I may be uncomfortable, but I'll live.
 10438	
 10439	Ukyou:	We did it!
 10440	FW:	Don't celebrate yet...
 10441	Ranma:	Hey, FireWater, are you alright?
 10442	FW:	No, haven't recovered as much as I hoped...
 10443		Too weak... Can't resist...  Lifeforce draining away..
 10444	Ranma:	What...?
 10445	
 10446	[ At the far end of the room, a door smashes open.  Enter a small army
 10447	  of zombies ]
 10448	
 10449	FW:	I forgot about their zombie army, sunlight won't kill them..
 10450	Ranma:	That's their entire fighting force, there's no way
 10451		we can stop them all!
 10452	FW:	Blast, GC is still standing, I'm the only one that can stop him..
 10453		AGHH!
 10454	Ukyou:	Jo, no!  You've pushed yourself too far.
 10455		Ran-chan, keep GC busy, I'll handle the zombies.
 10456	Ranma:	What?!  Wait a minute..
 10457	
 10458	[ She already ran into the zombie crowd ]

 10460			*		*		*
 10461	Kausmi:	You can put me down now, Dr. Tofu.
 10462	Tofu:	Oh, Hahahah!  Sorry....
 10463	
 10464	Aih:	Now Kay!
 10465	
 10466	[ Kay, summoning his remaing energy, throws the platinum dart into the wall
 10467	causing a small avalanche occurs, sealing the entrance.  The strain is too
 10468	much for him as he falls again unconscious again ]
 10469	
 10470	Akane:	Dr. Tofu!  Everyone, what's going on?
 10471	Tofu:	Akane!
 10472	Kasumi:	Nabiki.
 10473	Akane:	Where's Ranma?!
 10474	Tofu:	He's in there..
 10475	Akane:	I have to help him!
 10476	Aih:	There's no way in.
 10477	Nabiki:	Hmm, there are sure a lot of zombies going into that side door.
 10478	Akane:	Ranma.
 10479	Tofu:	Akane, I wouldn't go there...
 10480	Akane:	Ranma! [ runs in anyway ]
 10481	Kasumi:	Let her go.  Sometimes a girl must follow her heart...

 10483			*		*		*
 10484	
 10485	[ We see Ukyou, smashing into the zombies with her giant spatula,
 10486	  despite her start, the numbers are overwelming her. ]
 10487	
 10488	Ukyou:	There's too many of them, I have to use my special technique.
 10489		"Kuonji Smokescreen!"
 10490	[ Raising her arm high, she lets out a sack of flour.  Instantly she is
 10491	hidden by the rising dust while the zombies are left choking ]
 10492	
 10493	Zomb1:	Where she is?
 10494	Zomb2:	Must find..
 10495	
 10496	[ Outside the blast radius of the flour, Ukyou is calmy observing them ]
 10497	
 10498	Ukyou:	Hmm, I wonder if they know how volitile flour is?
 10499		[ lights a match and tosses it at them ]
 10500		Oh well. <BOOM!>
 10501	
 10502	Green:	Out of the way, girl-boy.  It's Jo I want.
 10503	Ranma:	If you want him you must first defeat me!
 10504	Green:	I'm not passing up a chance to bust Jo's chops...
 10505	Ranma:	You're lying, even though you're resisting the sunlight,
 10506		I can see it's having it's effects on you.
 10507	Green:	..especially before he busts mine.
 10508	Ranma:	You're no match for me now!
 10509	Green:	Let's finish it!
 10510	
 10511	[ They run towards each other with a battle cry on their lips.  Each brings
 10512	  back their arms and let out a blow. And then their fists impact! ]
 10513	
 10514	Buttons: [ observing ] What.. power!
 10515	Purple:	Amazing!
 10516	Green:	OWWW...
 10517	Ranma:	..My fist!
 10518	[ both stoop down clutching their fists in pain ]
 10519	
 10520	Ukyou:	Wait, the ancient weapons, I dropped them over there.
 10521		Here's the shield.. and there's the chain..
 10522	[ As she reaches for the it, someone else grabs it ]
 10523	
 10524	Needle:	[ weakly ] Looking for this, my dear?
 10525	Ukyou:	My chain.. give it back... 
 10526	Needle:	Hahaha.
 10527	Ukyou:	Give it back! [ starts throwing spatulas at him which barely miss ]
 10528	Needle: Hey, easy, I'm in a very delicate condition right now.
 10529	Ukyou:	GIVE IT BACK! [ starts slamming him with her shield ]
 10530	Needle:	...!
 10531	Ukyou:	GIVE IT.. [ striking him with her giant Spatula ]
 10532	
 10533	Akane:	Ranma!
 10534	Ranma:	Akane?!  What are you doing here?
 10535	Akane:	I'm here to help you ..!
 10536	Ranma:	Stupid!  This is  a dangerous fight, it's no place for a girl!
 10537	Ukyou:	Ran-chan!  Look, I got the weapons back!
 10538	Akane:	I was worried about you..
 10539	Ranma:	You uncute girl!
 10540	Akane:	You idiot!
 10541	
 10542	Green:	I'd be a real creep take advantage of the situation.
 10543		[ spits out a stream of acid ]
 10544		So I'm a creep.
 10545	
 10546	Ranma:	Akane, look out! [ pushes her away ]  ARGHGHGH!
 10547	[ Half his body is hit, he's so badly burned, you can even see some bone! ]
 10548	
 10549	Akane:	Ranma!
 10550	Ukyou:	Ran-chan!  I'll make you pay for that!
 10551	[ She swings the chain at GreenCoat but he just grabs it and pulls her in ]
 10552	
 10553	Green:	Jo's withdrawling his influence on you, without his mental support,
 10554		they're	only ordinary weapons. [ wresting with her ]
 10555		If you keep struggling like this,
 10556		I'm going to forget that we're supposed to be fighting.
 10557	
 10558	Tofu:	[ entering ] I'm here to help!
 10559	Aih:	Count me in!
 10560	Loshin:	Me two!
 10561	
 10562	Green:	Sheesh, you guys keep popping out of the woodwork.
 10563		Don't you ever give up?
 10564	Tofu:	We might ask the same of you.
 10565		[ throws some wooden stakes ]
 10566	Green:	Shield up!
 10567		[ grabs Ukyou's arm with the shield to block ]
 10568	Aih:	This shell has your name on it.
 10569		[ She pulls out her backup pistol from her boot sole ]
 10570	
 10571	Green:	A Gun?!  That's against every unwritten code of martial combat!
 10572		 [ In a loud burst, Aih fires ]
 10573		I knew I should have searched you when I had the chance..
 10574		 [ blocks with the shield, but the impact shakes him ]
 10575		That's no ordinary gun..
 10576		 [ She fires another shot which leaves him ringing ]
 10577		There's got to be a way out of this.
 10578	Aih:	Give up or I won't miss next time.
 10579	Green:	If you keep this up, you might hit the girl!
 10580	Aih:	...
 10581	Tofu:	Lotion-chan, NO! [ restraining her ]
 10582	Loshin:	Just one shot, just one shot!  Please!  I can make it!
 10583		[ she's trying to throw some crystal shards ]
 10584	Green:	Hmm, I hope those shards aren't what I think they are.
 10585	Aih:	Let her go!
 10586	Green:	Hahaha.  No way.
 10587	Akane:	You coward!  What kind of man are you?!
 10588	Green:	Stakes and stones may break my bones,
 10589		but skirts like you annoy me.
 10590	Akane:	What..?!
 10591	Green:	You know, you're cute when you're angry.
 10592	FireWater: [ weakly ] GC, you're the antithesis of the spirit 
 10593		of the Prime Directive, corrupting everything it stands for.
 10594	Green:	What?
 10595	FW:	Uhh... Look!  Is that Leonard Nimoy?!
 10596	Green:	WHERE?!
 10597	Akane:	This is for Ranma!
 10598		[ Her jump kick to his face knocks him away from Ukyou ]
 10599	Green:	Dot by tose again.. sniff
 10600	Aih:	How did you do that?
 10601	FW:	You.. you just have to know the right buttons to push.
 10602		Why didn't you use your gun before?
 10603	Aih:	I only had three shots.
 10604	Ukyou:	Akane, thank you.
 10605	Green:	So it's all of you against me?  Just the way I like it!
 10606		[ looking up ] And now the sun has set, a fair fight!
 10607		Saucer Seperation!
 10608	
 10609	[ His head flies off and starts spitting acid at various targets. ]
 10610	
 10611	Aih:	Horrible.. [ faints ]
 10612	
 10613	Ukyou:	Kyyaa! [ just barely blocks with the shield ]
 10614	
 10615	[ Unfortunately GreenCoat's body is also attacking ]
 10616	
 10617	Loshin:	[ she's knocked to the ground by a left hook along with Akane ]
 10618		I didn't lose!
 10619	
 10620	Tofu:	No!  Stop!
 10621	[ He jumps up and grabs GreenCoat's flying head.  Although he suffers some
 10622	  acid burns he  manages to slap a mystic seal on it's forehead.
 10623	  The head slows down but then.. ]
 10624	
 10625	Green's head:	Fool!  Did you really think one of your pitiful sanskrit
 10626		talismans could stop me? [ spits acid at it ]
 10627	Tofu:	Well actually... Yes.
 10628	
 10629	[ The talisman explodes knocking Green's head away ]
 10630	
 10631	Tofu:	I knew you were too powerful for just a talisman to stop,
 10632		so I coated that one with kerosole.
 10633		[ However GreenCoat's body is still on a ramapge ]
 10634	
 10635	FW:	I have to help.. [ he grabs some nearby stones ]
 10636		Delayed Exploding Point Technique! (Fire-Water-Cracker!)
 10637	[ He throws them into GreenCoat's body via the opening left by his head.
 10638	  A few seconds later his body explodes, the terrible damage absorbed
 10639	  completely by GreenCoat's body ]
 10640	
 10641	Aih:	[ waking ] What happened to him?
 10642	FW:	Antimatter core breach.
 10643	Loshin:	We win!
 10644	
 10645	Empress:	Hey, aren't you all forgetting something?!
 10646	[ She rises like a ghost and emits an electrical storm which shocks
 10647	  everyone unconscous ] 
 10648		While you've all been busy playing, I've been storing up 
 10649		my strength like a capacitor.  This body is not vampire,
 10650		sunlight doesn't bother me at all.  In fact, I enjoy tans!
 10651		You fools can never stand against my power!
 10652		The sun has just set, my vampire guard shall rise again!
 10653		This Thirteenth city shall be my crown of power!
 10654		I've won, the world belongs to me!
 10655	
 10656	[ And then the Twenty foot mecha crashed in and fell on top of her. ]

 10662	Aide B:	One of the towns on the outer perimeter, 
 10663		contact has been re-established!
 10664	Dr Kno:	That's odd.
 10665	Aide B: Yes, reports are still hazy, but apparently some sort of
 10666		localized disaster occured.
 10667	Dr Kno:	What could this mean?
 10668	Aide A:	Doctor!  A report is just coming in...
 10669		Another city has been restored!
 10670	Dr Kno:	Another one?  After being out of touch for so long..?
 10671	Aide A:	Sir!  Captain Zen's Delta unit was spotted!
 10672		A weather satellite in the vicinity of Tokyo marks his mecha
 10673		in that area.
 10674	Dr Kno:	Really?  So he's still alive...
 10675	Aide B:	Then so might officer Kay and.. Aih-sama!! [ has a dreamy look ]
 10676	Aide A:	Last sighting says he was trying to maintain his altitude when...
 10677		his systems went dead and he plunged like a rock.
 10678	Dr Kno:	What a shame.
 10679		[ and then he helped himself to another one of Zen's cigars ]

 10682	
 10683	[ A figure climbs out of the cockpit of the mecha.
 10684	  He takes off his helmet which has a little furry doll attached to it.
 10685	  The pilot looks around and then talks to his helmet ]
 10686	
 10687	Captain Zen: Totoro, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore...
 10688	
 10689	Buttons:	The Empress, is she alive?
 10690	Purple:	Contrary to popular belief, not everyone can survive being hit
 10691		by 20 tons of dead weight and escape with just a bump on the head.
 10692	Buttons:	So, she's dead.
 10693	Purple:	You got that right.  And so is everyone else.
 10694	Buttons:	We're the last two.  Let's not join them.
 10695	
 10696	Zen:	You two there!  I don't know what's going on, but Freeze!
 10697		(Gosh, I always wanted to say that)
 10698	Purple:	We must retreat.
 10699	Buttons:	Hurry, before he..
 10700	Zen:	Fire!  [ His mecha aims it's plasma canon at them and.. ]
 10701		<FTZZ!>  Darn!  My solar cells are exhausted.
 10702	
 10703	[ The two vampires transform into bats and start flying off.
 10704	  Then one of them suddenly falls down, there's a silver piece of metal
 10705	  stuck in it.  The other bat doesn't even look back. ]
 10706

 10709	Nabiki:	It was nothing...
 10710	
 10711	Akane:	How is Ranma?
 10712	Tofu:	Not good.  I fear his injuries are fatal.
 10713	Akane:	Ranma... [ starts crying ] Don't die.. I.. I.. 
 10714	FW:	Do not grieve, he will soon become one with the universe,
 10715		and he'll have plenty of company.   cough cough
 10716	Ranma:	[ very weakly ] Akane..
 10717	Akane:	Ranma!  He's still alive!
 10718	Tofu:	Ranma, easy.
 10719	Ranma:	AkAHHne.. I.. I.. lAHH.. yUHH!
 10720	Nabiki:	Not for long.
 10721	FW:	...
 10722	Akane:	It's not fair!  Ranma, you died saving me.. saving us..
 10723	
 10724	FireWater: ...
 10725		Take him, take everyone, to the Healing Chambers.
 10726		Nabiki knows where it is.  The waters there are supercharged,
 10727		they can save the life of any human injury.
 10728		Hurry, the effect will not last long.. Hurry!
 10729	
 10730	[ Everyone runs off with an injuried person, except for.. ]
 10731	
 10732	Tofu:	Mr. FireWater.. what about you?
 10733	FW:	Like I said, they will save the life of any human injury.
 10734	Tofu:	But you...
 10735	FW:	Haven't you guessed by now?  I am more, much more, than human..
 10736	Tofu:	What..!  You're discorporating!
 10737		I'm a doctor, can't I help?...
 10738	FW:	No, I am dying, it's too late for me.  The only way for me to
 10739		survive is by stealing another person's right to happiness.
 10740		Something the Fang would do without a second thought.
 10741		But I would rather die than walk that path.
 10742		I have already done too much as it is.
 10743		But there is one last task I must perform.  With my last strength,
 10744		I shall cleanse the world of the Fang's dark dominion..
 10745		But I need your help, will you permit me..?
 10746	Tofu:	Mr. FireWater...
 10747	FW:	Do not grieve, Heros never die.  I, FireWater, shall return.
 10748	
 10749	[ A short while later Dr. Tofu sadly walks out and heads to the Healing
 10750	  Tanks.  He looks back just once. ]
 10751	Tofu:	Rest in piece.
 10752	
 10753	[ And and then runs off to give his medical assistance.  Back in the
 10754	  chamber we see that FW is still unconscious and has seemed to have shrunk
 10755	  two feet.  A few moments pass by and  suddenly the body of FW jerks and
 10756	  sits up. ]   
 10757	
 10758	FW:	Yawn!  Where am I?  What's this thing on me?
 10759	
 10760	[ FW starts disrobing and we see the body of a familar girl with long
 10761	  light brown hair.  Finally the figure takes off the faceplate.  She has
 10762	  goggles on her face. ]
 10763	
 10764	FW?:	Sheesh!  I better take these off too..
 10765	
 10766	[ She discards the robes and faceplate in a pile and removes the goggles ]
 10767	
 10768	Tsubasa++:	Hmm, the store sure looks different ever since those
 10769			zombies tore it up.  I wonder where Ukyou-sama is?
 10770	
 10771	[ Tsubasa hears a commotion down the hall and runs down towards it. ]
 10772	
 10773	[ A little while later, one can almost hear the low echo of a high-pitched
 10774	  laughter permeating the room and a small puff of smoke erupts.  There is
 10775	  a low a whisper: ] 
 10776		"Everything is going according to plan"
 10777	
 10778	-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 10779	
 10780	+ Apparently from Japanese superstition, you can drive away demons
 10781	  with beans.
 10782	
 10783	++ If you remember he was captured all the way back in part 4.
 10784	   And the Fang originally thought it was Ukyou's dead body brought back by
 10785	   DS-Kodachi .
 10786		I also misspelled his name to be Tsubame earlier instead of Tsubasa.
 10787		Sorry for any confusion.
 10788	
 10789	Character Profile:	FireWater
 10790		Very little is known about this man or woman.  He keeps his
 10791	identity almost completely secret and has had various of aliases.  In one 
 10792	past life he was known as Jo BlueRobe, and at this time had a falling out
 10793	with the Fang and some of it's core memebers such as PurpleCoat (PC to
 10794	him), GreenCoat (GC to him), and the Fang Emperess.
 10795		He calls himself a specialist in the supernatural and investigates
 10796	odd occurences, usually to combat some dark force of evil.  But he and the
 10797	Fang seem to have a grudge from a long time ago.  It is even speculated
 10798	that FireWater is hundreds of years old.  He also apparently has some links
 10799	with Happosai, claiming to be his teacher.  He often refers to the
 10800	Wandering One, some unknown cosmic entity force of good, as his mentor
 10801	although the two have barely met. 
 10802		It is also speculated that he has some sort of spirit transferal 
 10803	power which enables him to possess a host.  But he is very lothe to do so,
 10804	since the last thing he wants to emulate is a life-stealing vampire, even
 10805	at the cost of his own life.
 10806		He seems to be a modern person who is constantly learning and
 10807	mastering new skills, to advance with the times.  It is known that he has
 10808	cyber-punk training.  Although he is a complete mystery, whatever his past,
 10809	his goal always seems to be a noble one.
 10810	
 10811	Powers:
 10812		The full extent of FireWater's powers has not been seen.  He has
 10813	deep knowledge of the occult and has mastered to the full extent, a wide
 10814	variety of special martial arts techniques.  His most powerful yet draining
 10815	techinique seems to be his: Winged Griffin Pounce, where he summons his
 10816	full energy into the form of an unstoppable giant night-blue Griffin image.
 10817	It is unknown if he has any magical or other powers but it is known that he
 10818	has some degree of psychic awareness and mental powers.  It is known that
 10819	he is not completely human.  
 10820	
 10821	Physical Description:
 10822		A tall seven foot man wearing plain blue robes and a shiny circular
 10823	facemask devoid of any features save two eyeslits.  Kind of like a cross
 10824	between Lover-boy from Vampire Girl Miyu and Jason from Friday the 13th.
 10825	Unlike both, he talks.
