     4	              FILE NAMES AND EXTENSIONS - THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM
     5	
     6	       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
     7	
     8	       To the beginner, DOS is a little cryptic in its use of file 
     9	       names. Study the example directory listing below and the
    10	       notes to the right of the listing:
    11	
    12	       PCPC     EXE    51489   5-03-86   3:36p   ---> PCPC.EXE          
    13	       PCPR     EXE    21457   5-03-86   3:29p   ---> PCPR.EXE          
    14	       PCPY     EXE    32017   5-03-86   3:39p   ---> PCPY.EXE          
    15	       README            128   5-03-86  12:46p   ---> README
    16	       NOTES565 TXT     1390   7-03-86   8:31a   ---> NOTES565.TXT
    17	       
    18	       In each case you will note the REAL file name to the right and 
    19	       the directory listing version to the left. The point is that
    20	       in DOS, filenames always have a name, a period or dot and an
    21	       optional (but highly useful) extension. This is a very important 
    22	       point!
    23	       
    24	                        KEYS TO THE SHAREWARE KINGDOM!
    25	
    26	       Study the following list carefully, perhaps print it on paper 
    27	       and mark it with a colored highlighter. This list contains a 
    28	       roster of filename extensions which reveals the type of file and 
    29	       its possible contents and application. 
    30	       
    31	             FILE EXTENSIONS WHICH PROBABLY CONTAIN DOCUMENTATION,
    32	                         INSTRUCTIONS OR PRINTED TEXT
    33	
    34	       .DOC       ---------> Probable DOCumentation file
    35	       .TXT       ---------> Probable Text (TXT) file
    36	       .MAN       ---------> Probable MANual/instruction file
    37	       .LST       ---------> Probable file containing a LIST.
    38	       .PRN       ---------> Probable text file from a PRINTED source.
    39	       .INS       ---------> Probable INSTRUCTIONS in text form.
    40	       .HLP       ---------> Probable HELP text file.
    41	       .          ---------> NO, EXTENSION. VERY LIKELY A TEXT FILE!
    42	       .HST       ---------> Probable text file containing HISTORY of
    43	                             program revisions
    44	       
    45	             FILENAMES (WITH OR WITHOUT EXTENSIONS) WHICH PROBABLY
    46	                     CONTAIN INSTRUCTIONS OR PRINTED TEXT
    47	
    48	       README     ---------> VERY IMPORTANT TEXT FILE
    49	       READ.ME    ---------> VERY IMPORTANT TEXT FILE
    50	       READ.1ST   ---------> VERY IMPORTANT TEXT FILE
    51	       READ       ---------> VERY IMPORTANT TEXT FILE
    52	       READ.NOW   ---------> VERY IMPORTANT TEXT FILE
    53	       
    54	       NOTE! There are so many variations of the "READ..." theme that
    55	       hopefully you can imagine other variations of this "READ..."
    56	       concept!
    57	       
    58	       If you stop and think about it for a minute, most of these 
    59	       extensions and filenames offer strong clues about file contents 
    60	       and phonetically "hint" to you what the file contains. Here are 
    61	       some examples you might actually see. Note the "clues" that tell 
    62	       you text or instructions are available inside the file:
    63	
    64	             1232XX.TXT            MAKE445.DOC       SYSOPS.       
    65	             ASEASY.LST            MANUAL.TXT        READ.         
    66	             DATABASE.DOC          MANUAL.           AUTHOR.       
    67	             ENTIRE.MAN            FORMFEED.MAN      VENDOR.       
    68	             MONEY.TXT             HOMEHELP.HLP      README.       
    69	             README.!!!            HOMEHELP.LST      README.NOW   
    70	             READSOON.             HOMEHELP.HST      VENDORS.      
    71	             BBM.PRN               TRY44B.DOC        MANUAL.PRN   
    72	       
    73	       Once you have determined that a file contains text or 
    74	       instructions, you need to read the information on your screen. 
    75	       There are three ways to do this 1) the hard old DOS way. 2) the 
    76	       better DOS way 3) use a file viewer - easiest. 
    77	
    78	       1) THE HARD, BUT ACCEPTABLE WAY: Use DOS TYPE command: 
    79	
    80	       Example, A>type readme.doc   (will type the document file 
    81	       README.DOC to the screen) 
    82	       
    83	       Example, A>type B:readme.doc   (will type the document file 
    84	       README.DOC which is on the B: floppy drive) 
    85	
    86	       Example, A>type readme.doc>prn  (will type the document on your 
    87	       printer). Important! 
    88	
    89	       Use the Ctrl and S keys together to pause rapid screen 
    90	       scrolling. Any key touched resumes and Ctrl-S again pauses. Use 
    91	       Ctrl and C keys (Ctrl-C) to abort the whole process! Think of 
    92	       this reminder: Ctrl-S means "stop." Ctrl-C means "crash the 
    93	       process." 
    94	
    95	       2) A SLIGHTLY BETTER WAY: DOS MORE AND PIPING 
    96	
    97	       Here is another shortcut if the screen of information scrolls by 
    98	       too fast to read. Use the DOS MORE filter. This MAY or MAY NOT 
    99	       work on some computers. Switch to your hard drive where the file 
   100	       MORE.COM usually resides in the DOS subdirectory. Now to read 
   101	       the documentation file, for example README.DOC, on the A: drive, 
   102	       do this: 
   103	
   104	       C>TYPE A:README.DOC|MORE 
   105	
   106	       Note that you are in the C: drive. You are viewing the file 
   107	       README.DOC on the A: drive. The vertical bar | is usually on the 
   108	       backslash key \ and is a shifted charter (uppercase). Note that 
   109	       there are no blank spaces between the file name README.DOC, the 
   110	       vertical bar | and the MORE command. This may or may not work on 
   111	       all computers. MORE.COM must be pathed through the DOS directory 
   112	       to work. More is a DOS filter. The vertical bar | is called a 
   113	       pipe. Thus we are "piping" the output of the type command though 
   114	       the more filter. Sounds odd, but this is one of the obscure 
   115	       tricks of DOS! 
   116	
   117	       3) THE BEST WAY: An external file viewer or browser. The easiest 
   118	       and most comforable. 
   119	
   120	       Sometimes a shareware vendor or computer club can provide a file 
   121	       viewer. These go by many names. Popular viewers are LIST.COM,
   122	       BROWSE.COM, VIEW.EXE, PAGE.EXE and others. These let you view 
   123	       inside a text file and page up and down with minimum muss and 
   124	       fuss! For our example, let's pretend you are using the popular 
   125	       LIST.COM program.
   126	
   127	       Example, A>list readme.doc   (will type the document file 
   128	       README.DOC to the screen) 
   129	       
   130	       Example, A>list A:readme.doc   (will type the document file 
   131	       README.DOC which is on the A: floppy drive to the screen) 
   132	       
   133	       Example, A>list C:\doc\readme.doc   (will type the document 
   134	       file README.DOC which is on the C: hard drive in the \DOC 
   135	       subdirectory to the screen) 
   136	
   137	       Here's another tip. Sometimes a shareware program may not use a 
   138	       file like PROGRAM.DOC or README.TXT for instructions but instead 
   139	       a program file like README.COM or MANUAL.EXE or VPDOCS.COM. The 
   140	       idea here is that instead of using a TEXT FILE the programmer is 
   141	       using a program to run and display the documentation! So for 
   142	       this variation, you simple run the program to see the 
   143	       documentation. 
   144	       
   145	       Example: for VPDOC.COM at the DOS prompt simply type the name 
   146	       of the file:  C>VPDOC  (then press return/enter key)  
   147	       
   148	       Example:  For README.COM    C>README  (then press return/enter 
   149	       key)
   150	
   151	       Let's move on and talk about other filenames and extensions 
   152	       which do other jobs on a computer.
   153	
   154	                      OTHER IMPORTANT FILENAME EXTENSIONS
   155	
   156	       .EXE       ---------> An EXECUTABLE FILE which starts program
   157	       .COM       ---------> A COMMAND FILE which starts program
   158	       .BAT       ---------> BATCH FILE which starts program
   159	       .BAS       ---------> BASIC file which can be run with
   160	                             the aid of the GWBASIC interpreter
   161	                             GWBASIC which is normally on your DOS
   162	                             disk or hard drive.
   163	
   164	                    FILE EXTENSIONS WHICH INDICATE THE FILE 
   165	         IS "COMPRESSED OR ARCHIVED" AND MUST BE UNPACKED PRIOR TO USE
   166	
   167	       .ZIP       ---------> Compressed file, use PKUNZIP to unpack
   168	       .ARC       ---------> Compressed file, use ARC 
   169	       .PAK       ---------> Compressed file, use PAK
   170	       .LZH       ---------> Compressed file, use LHARC
   171	       .ZOO       ---------> Compressed file, use ZOO
   172	
   173	                            OTHER USEFUL EXTENSIONS
   174	
   175	       .BAK       --------->  A backup or duplicate file
   176	       .DAT       --------->  A data file
   177	       .CFG       --------->  Configuration data for program
   178	       .WKS       --------->  Spreadsheet file
   179	       .WK1       --------->  Spreadsheet file
   180	       .DBF       --------->  Database file in dBase format
   181	       .ASC       --------->  ASCII file, perhaps a basic program
   182	                              saved in ASCII format
   183	       .BIN       --------->  Binary file, file used by a program
   184	
   185	       Some shareware disk vendors try to help you by putting their own 
   186	       files on a disk with a little extra information. The following 
   187	       file examples might offer help in text or documentation form. An 
   188	       advanced shareware user would guess quickly that these files 
   189	       refer to a disk from a shareware vendor or computer club library 
   190	       and are most probably disk number 565 in a larger set of 
   191	       programs that vendor or club offers in a library collection.

   195	       
   196	       If you buy a disk from a disk vendor named BEST VALUE SHAREWARE 
   197	       DISTRIBUTORS you might look for files such as the following 
   198	       which also contain text, BAT, COM or other file startup 
   199	       information. 
   200	       
   201	       Each vendor might use a different system, but watch for these 
   202	       patterns as you list directory information on a shareware disk. 
   203	       With the variety of methods, your best bet is to study filename 
   204	       extensions for a few minutes and "play detective" which for some 
   205	       folks is a bit of the interest in using shareware!

   217	       
   218	                  COM, EXE AND BAT FILES START PROGRAMS 
   219	       
   220	       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
   221	       
   222	       A file ending in EXE or COM is a file which contains a 
   223	       EXECUTABLE OR "RUNNABLE" program and is a way to start a 
   224	       software package. 
   225	       
   226	       Examples:
   227	
   228	       To start PCF.EXE do this    PCF  (then press enter).  
   229	       For DBFKK.EXE               DBFKK (then press enter.) 
   230	       
   231	       Some files which end in BAS will need a basic interpreter such 
   232	       as GWBASIC.EXE to operate. Example files would be GAME.BAS or 
   233	       MUSIC.BAS. GWBASIC.EXE is usually included on your DOS disk
   234	       which came with the computer.
   235	       
   236	       Another standard of shareware programs is to use batch files to 
   237	       start programs. GO.BAT or MENU.BAT or START.BAT or INSTALL.BAT 
   238	       are "batch files." Simply type the first word at the prompt to 
   239	       proceed.  
   240	       
   241	       Example: for file GO.BAT       GO (then press enter). 
   242	
   243	       DOS searches a disk for programs to run in a precise order:
   244	
   245	       HELLO.COM  ---------> Run this first if found then try 
   246	       HELLO.EXE  ---------> to find and run this then
   247	       HELLO.BAT  ---------> try to find and run this.
   248	              
   249	       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
   250	       
   251	                               BASIC DATA FILES
   252	       
   253	       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
   254	
   255	       If you find a BASIC program file which ends in .BAS try this
   256	       per the following example . . .
   257	
   258	       For the file HELLO.BAS, first copy both GWBASIC.EXE
   259	       and HELLO.BAS to a blank formatted diskette. Then issue the 
   260	       command:
   261	
   262	       A>GWBASIC HELLO
   263	
   264	       Another alternative is to leave GWBASIC.EXE on your hard drive 
   265	       and tell it where the basic program is located. 
   266	
   267	       Example:     C>GWBASIC A:HELLO
   268	
   269	       The above example assumes a copy of GWBASIC.EXE resides on your 
   270	       hard drive and a floppy containing the basic program HELLO.BAS 
   271	       is on the A: drive.
   272	
   273	       The program will be loaded into GWBASIC and run. If you
   274	       don't care for the program, try to exit if the program gives
   275	       you a menu of choices, otherwise press CTRL-BREAK keys
   276	       at same time which will let GWBASIC exit. You will see an
   277	       "OK" prompt. Type the word "system" and press the return/enter 
   278	       key to return you to DOS and leave GWBASIC. 
   279	
   280	       Basic is a rather elegant and precise programming system if you 
   281	       are interested! Pick up a book at your local library and you can 
   282	       learn how to use GWBASIC.EXE on your DOS disk to write and modify 
   283	       your own elaborate custom programs! Also investigate the
   284	       availability of affordable Basic compiler programs which prepare 
   285	       speedy .EXE free standing programs rather than requiring you to 
   286	       haul out your GWBASIC.EXE file each time you wish to run the 
   287	       program.

   291	                      SOME EXAMPLES - OUR FIRST POP QUIZ!
   292	
   293	       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
   294	
   295	       Try to puzzle through this pop quiz! Small stars next to the 
   296	       filenames indicate an educated guess as to IMPORTANT TEXT 
   297	       information or documentation contained within. These directory 
   298	       lists are similar to what you might see on your screen when using 
   299	       the DIR command when you first explore a new software disk. Brief 
   300	       notes may follow each directory listing. 
   301	       
   302	       ** means high probability documentation is contained within
   303	       *  means some documentation possibly is contained within

   323	       Note that on the above disk the LARGEST file PCPAY.DOC contains
   324	       64,512 bytes. Its size leads to strong suspicion it contains 
   325	       the main documentation. Shorter files probably contain other 
   326	       useful data. The two files at the bottom of the directory listing 
   327	       make one suspect this disk in number 565 in a club library or 
   328	       disk vendor collection. Sherlock Holmes would approve of our
   329	       logic!

   346	       The largest file which hints it contains text data would be a 
   347	       good candidate to examine! The file SETUP.BAT suggests that

   369	       This is a disk with several important documentation files, but
   370	       a highly unusual second subdirectory! COMFILES <DIR> contains
   371	       other file(s) and must ALSO be examined. The DOS CD or
   372	       change directory command must be used to examine this other
   373	       subdirectory or file storage area of the disk. See your DOS manual.
   374	       Most shareware authors try to stay away from using additional
   375	       subdirectories on a disk which can confuse a beginner. The file
   376	       LASTMIN.ANN would tell an advanced shareware user that the file
   377	       contains "last minute announcements" and is most probably 
   378	       a text file. TUTR.DOC probably means "tutorial document."
   379	       QUICK.DOC is probably quick startup documentation.
   380	                  
   381

   384	       
   385	       This is an odd disk indeed. No documentation? Actually this
   386	       is a special SELF-EXTRACTING file which is usually copied
   387	       to a hard drive run with the command HM. The file will proceed 
   388	       to unpack itself and produce several files containing 
   389	       documentation, COM or EXE files and more! Most authors would
   390	       include a small README file on the disk to advise you of this 
   391	       fact, but this author has omitted even that! If you locate a 
   392	       large EXE file, copy it to your hard drive (perhaps into
   393	       a subdirectory named TEMP or temporary) and then run the
   394	       file to cause it to unpack and produce all the little subfiles
   395	       which are the main program! Shareware authors do this to 
   396	       conserve disk space or otherwise compress large programs to
   397	       fit onto fewer disks.
   398

   406	       READ1ST.EXE is run since it is a self-extracting EXE file which 
   407	       probably produces documentation notes. The other three files are 
   408	       probably self-extracting files which produce three separate 
   409	       programs. This is a case of multiple self-extracting files! A 
   410	       clever author is highly compressing his data to save space on 
   411	       disk!
