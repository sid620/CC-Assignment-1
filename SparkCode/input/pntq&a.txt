     3	                            Q & A
     4	                       March 22, 1993

     6	Background
     7	
     8	     On March 22, Intel Corporation announced production
     9	shipments and technical details of its fifth-generation,
    10	compatible processor, the PentiumTM processor.  Pentium
    11	processor-based system announcements will be made by
    12	computer manufacturers beginning in mid-May.
    13	
    14	General
    15	
    16	Q1.  Which markets will be the first to employ Pentium
    17	     processor-based systems?
    18	
    19	A1.  We expect that initial customers for Pentium processor-
    20	     based systems will be traditional early adopters who
    21	     require increased performance to meet their needs.  The
    22	     Pentium processor will power advanced personal
    23	     computers, workstations and super servers.
    24	
    25	Q2.  I just bought an Intel486TM CPU-based system; is the
    26	     Pentium processor going to obsolete it?
    27	
    28	A2.  No.  The Intel486TM CPU remains the mainstream processor.
    29	     The Pentium processor will have limited availability in
    30	     '93 and will be targeted at high-end applications, such
    31	     as servers.   As we have seen with the Intel486 CPU,
    32	     the Pentium processor will evolve downward in the
    33	     market and one day become the volume mainstream
    34	     processor .
    35	
    36	Speed/Performance
    37	
    38	Q3.  What is the performance of the Pentium processor in
    39	     comparison to an Intel486 CPU?
    40	
    41	A3.  The Pentium processor runs applications up to five
    42	     times as fast as the popular, desktop-standard 33-MHz
    43	     Intel486 DX CPU.  The 66-MHz Pentium processor operates
    44	     at 112 million instuctions per second Dhrystone (MIPS),
    45	     it has a SPECint92 rating of 64.5 and SPECfp92 rating
    46	     of 56.9 and an Intel iCOMPTM Index rating of 567.   The
    47	     performance delta between the 66- and 60-MHz version of
    48	     the Pentium processor is about 10 percent.

    55	
    56	
    57	Q4.  What is the performance of the Pentium processor in
    58	     comparison to RISC machines?
    59	
    60	A4.  The Pentium processor has equal or greater integer
    61	     performance (SPECint92) than all current volume
    62	     shipping RISC-based systems.  In addition, the Pentium
    63	     processor has demonstrated workstation-class floating-
    64	     point performance.
    65	     The RISC processors available today are designed to be
    66	     a very high-end processors.  In the mainstream volume
    67	     workstation and PC marketplace, it is important to be
    68	     able to ship millions of processors, not just
    69	     thousands.
    70	
    71	Q5.  What is the iCOMPTM Index?
    72	
    73	A5.  The iCOMPTM Index was created by Intel as an easy-to-use
    74	     index to give PC buyers useful processor performance
    75	     information when selecting an Intel-based PC.  This
    76	     tool reflects the performance of the microprocessor and
    77	     should not be used as a measurement of overall system
    78	     performance.
    79	     For example, the Intel486 SX CPU at 25-MHz has an iCOMP
    80	     rating of 100, the Intel486 DX2 CPU at 66-MHz has an
    81	     iCOMP rating of 297 and the Pentium processor at 66-MHz
    82	     has an iCOMP rating of 567.
    83	
    84	Naming
    85	
    86	Q6.  Why did you name it the Pentium processor?
    87	
    88	A6.  The purpose of naming it the Pentium processor is to
    89	     help users recognize the genuine Intel processor.
    90	     Imitators sell products using the "386" and "486"
    91	     designation when the products are not on par with
    92	     Intel's.  We want to ensure that the PC user knows
    93	     which processor is the genuine Intel chip.  The Pentium
    94	     name will designate that:  no one else can legally use
    95	     that name.
    96	
    97	Upgradability
    98	
    99	Q7.  I have heard people refer to Pentium Ready or OverDriveTM
   100	     Pentium systems.  What are they and when will they be
   101	     available?
   102	
   103	A7.  Many Intel486 DX2 CPU-based systems will be upgradable
   104	     to Pentium processor technology.  Whether systems are
   105	     upgradable is based on system design considerations.
   106	     The Pentium processor-based OverDriveTM Processor will be
   107	     introduced in 1994.

   113	Software
   114	
   115	Q8.  What applications are best suited for Pentium processor-
   116	     based machines?
   117	
   118	A8.  The Pentium processor will enable high-performance
   119	     servers at a lower cost than currently available. The
   120	     Pentium processor is capable of running all major
   121	     network operating systems with scalability from the
   122	     desktop to the data center.
   123	
   124	     Performance-intensive desktop and technical
   125	     applications, such as imaging, real-time video and
   126	     voice recognition will benefit from the increased
   127	     performance available from the Pentium processor.  In
   128	     addition, it will expand the acceptance of Intel
   129	     processor-based systems into applications such as
   130	     scientific modeling, computer-aided design/engineering
   131	     (CAD/CAE), large-scale financial analysis and high-
   132	     throughput client/server applications.
   133	
   134	Q9.  Will software written for 286/386/486 CPU-based systems
   135	     run on the Pentium processor? What will be the
   136	     difference?
   137	
   138	A9.  Yes, Intel has always been committed to compatibility
   139	     across processor generations and that will continue.
   140	     To achieve the highest possible software application
   141	     performance from Pentium processor and Intel486 CPU-
   142	     based systems, software can be optimized.
   143	
   144	Q10. What is software optimization?
   145	
   146	A10. Optimization is the process by which operating systems
   147	     and application software are developed or recompiled to
   148	     take full advantage of the Intel architecture.  Results
   149	     are most dramatic on the Intel486 and Pentium processor-
   150	     based systems.
   151	
   152	Q11. How much faster can the Pentium processor run today's
   153	     software than the Intel486 DX2 CPU?
   154	
   155	A11. About 40-70% faster than the 66-MHz Intel486 DX2 CPU
   156	     running existing software.

   164	
   165	Q12. Which software developers have committed to optimizing
   166	     their applications for the Intel architecture?
   167	
   168	A12. Currently, Andersen Consulting*, Adobe*, Aldus*,
   169	     Autodesk*, Cadre*, Calera*, ComputerVision*, Dragon*,
   170	     EDS*, Frame Technology*, Gain Technology*, Gupta*,
   171	     Hypercube*, IBM*, Ithaca*, Interleaf*, Knowledgeware*,
   172	     Kurzweil*, Lotus*, Microsoft*, Novell*, NCR*, Oracle*,
   173	     Pixar*, Reuters*, SAS*, SCO*, Set Technology*, Sigma
   174	     Design*, SunSoft*, Sybase*, Univel*, Viewlogic*,
   175	     Ventura* Software, and Wolfram* have all committed that
   176	     one or more of their applications will be optimized for
   177	     the Intel architecture. More software companies are
   178	     committing every week.
   179	
   180	Q13. Which operating system suppliers are committed to
   181	     supporting Pentium processor? When?
   182	
   183	A13. IBM*, Microsoft*, NeXT*, Novell*, SCO*, SunSoft*,
   184	     Univel* and USL*. You will need to check with them on
   185	     announcement plans or ship schedules.
   186	
   187	Q14. Which compiler and tools companies are supplying
   188	     optimized tools and compilers?
   189	
   190	A14. Absoft*, Borland*, IBM*, Liant*, MetaWare*, Micro
   191	     Focus*, Microsoft*, NeXT*, SCO*, USL*, and WATCOM*.
   192	
   193	Q15. If Pentium processor performance is so great, why would
   194	     I want or need to optimize my software?
   195	
   196	A15. While the Pentium processor is significantly more
   197	     powerful than its predecessors, performance can be
   198	     enhanced when software is optimized for the Intel
   199	     architecture. Intel has been working with its software
   200	     partners for over a year to ensure that full advantage
   201	     of the Pentium processor and Intel486 microprocessor
   202	     performance can be taken by tools, compilers, operating
   203	     systems and application software.
   204	
   205	Q16. How much incremental performance can I expect from an
   206	     optimized application running on a Pentium processor-
   207	     based system?
   208	
   209	A16. Performance enhancements will vary, but early
   210	     optimization projects have yielded up to 30%
   211	     performance enhancement over the enhancement provided
   212	     by the chip alone.

   218	Technical Details
   219	
   220	Q17. How does the Pentium processor differ from the Intel486
   221	     CPU?  What are new features of the Pentium processor?
   222	
   223	A17. The Pentium processor  includes both new architectural
   224	     features as well as enhancements to the Intel486 CPU.
   225	     New architectural features are superscalar
   226	     architecture, a totally redesigned Floating Point Unit
   227	     (FPU), branch prediction, separate code and data
   228	     caches, a write back cache with MESI  (Mutual Exclusive
   229	     Shared Invalid) protocol, multiprocessor support and
   230	     built-in data integrity for increased reliability.
   231	     Other enhancements to the architecture include
   232	     hardwired instructions, enhanced microcode, increased
   233	     page size, 64-bit data bus and pipelining.
   234	
   235	Q18. What is superscalar?
   236	
   237	A18. Superscalar is new to the Pentium processor  and is a
   238	     microarchitecture design technique that allows multiple
   239	     instructions to be executed simultaneously on chip.
   240	     (An anology: superscalar is like adding another lane to
   241	     a single lane highway; more cars (instructions) can go
   242	     to the same place at the same time).
   243	
   244	Q19. What is branch prediction?
   245	
   246	A19. Branch prediction is new to the Pentium processor and
   247	     is another performance improvement technique.  Since
   248	     software execution incurs substantial delays on
   249	     branches, points in the software instruction stream
   250	     require a branch to a new, non-contiguous location in
   251	     system memory to fetch the next instruction.  This
   252	     Intel-developed technology will predict where the
   253	     program is going next and can actually begin working on
   254	     the next instruction before it is actually called upon.
   255	
   256	Q20. Why do you have separate data and instruction (code)
   257	     caches?
   258	
   259	A20. Having the two separate caches allows the CPU to fetch
   260	     data and code in parallel, doubling the available cache
   261	     bandwidth. In addition, the Pentium processor has  very
   262	     large on-chip data paths, some as large as 256 bits.
   263	     The data cache is dual access, meaning two instructions
   264	     can read and write data in parallel.  This complements
   265	     the superscalar design (dual pipeline).
