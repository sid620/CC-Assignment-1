     4	All Micropolis SCSI drives come pre-formatted from the factory. There is
     5	very little that needs to be done to this type of drive besides setting up 
     6	termination and SCSI ID.
     7	
     8	SCSI ID SETTINGS
     9	----------------
    10	
    11	    In order for the SCSI bus to be able to tell where it is getting its 
    12	    information from, it is neccessary for each drive to have a particular
    13	    identification number. This identification number, known as the SCSI ID
    14	    is set with jumpers on the back of the drive. All the drives in the SCSI 
    15	    chain must have a different number. 
    16	
    17	    These jumpers are located inside the 24-pin connect located on the back 
    18	    of the drive (next to the 50-pin cable connector). 
    19	
    20	    If you hold the drive with the cable connectors toward your body and
    21	    the circuit board side facing upwards, you will see the power connector
    22	    on the left, the 50-pin connector in the middle, and the 24-pin connector
    23	    on the right. 
    24	
    25	    The jumpers for the 24-pin connector are as follows:
    26	
    27	    50-Pin Connector                     24-Pin Connector
    28	    ______________        _________________________________________________
    29	    . . . . . . . |      | o o o . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . |
    30	    . . . . . . . |      | o o o . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . |
    31	    -------------/        \-----------------------------------------------/
    32	                           | | |
    33	                           | | ID2 (Value 4)
    34	                           | |
    35	                           | ID1 (Value 2)
    36	                           |
    37	                           ID0 (Value 1)
    38	
    39	    If this is the going to be the only drive in the system, it should be set
    40	    to SCSI ID 0, which is attained by having NO jumpers in the first 3 pairs
    41	    of the 24 pin connector. For every additional drive, the SCSI ID should
    42	    be incremented by 1. So if you have 3 drives in the system, your primary
    43	    drive should be at SCSI ID 0, your secondary at SCSI ID 1, and your final
    44	    drive at SCSI id 2.
    45	
    46	    SCSI ID can be computed as follows by installing jumpers in the following
    47	    pairs of pins:
    48	
    49	    SCSI ID    ID0  ID1  ID2       SCSI ID    ID0  ID1  ID2
    50	    ------------------------       ------------------------
    51	       0    |                         4    |             X
    52	       1    |   X                     5    |   X         X
    53	       2    |        X                6    |        X    X
    54	       3    |   X    X                7    |   X    X    X
    55	
    56	
    57	    Each of the pairs of pins have values (as shown in the diagram). In order
    58	    to get a certain SCSI id, just jumper the pins as you wish and the sum of
    59	    the values is your SCSI ID. So if you have ID0 (value of 1) and ID2
    60	    (value 4) jumpered, your SCSI id will be 5.
    61	
    62	    NOTE:   SCSI ID 7, should never be used. This is usually reserved for the
    63	            host adapter.
    64	
    65	
    66	DRIVE TERMINATION
    67	-----------------
    68	
    69	    Termination is something that causes a lot of undue grief for everyone, but
    70	    the concept is really simple.
    71	      
    72	        "Only the last drive in the SCSI chain must be terminated, 
    73	         all others should be un-terminated."
    74	    
    75	              and
    76	
    77	        "The SCSI chain must be terminated on both ends."
    78	 
    79	    There are two possible termination configurations.
    80	    
    81	    1.  A HOST ADAPTER WITH ONLY INTERNAL OR ONLY EXTERNAL DRIVES
    82	
    83	        This is the most common configuration, and this configuration applies
    84	        to BOTH INTERNAL and EXTERNAL drives. The controller must be terminated
    85	        (which is the way it comes from 99.99% of the manufacturers) AND the
    86	        very last drive/component on the CABLE (do not get "the last drive on
    87	        the cable" confused with the "last drive, which would be the highest
    88	        SCSI ID"). 
    89	
    90	        Therefore, a graphic display would look as follows:
    91	           ____
    92	          /    \ External OR Internal 
    93	         | HOST |=====DEVICE=====DEVICE
    94	          \____/        |          |
    95	            |    UN-TERMINATED     |
    96	            |                      |
    97	        TERMINATED             TERMINATED
    98	        (Usually default)
    99	
   100	        So once again:
   101	
   102	             If you have only one drive, it is to be TERMINATED.
   103	             If you have more than one drive, all drives must be UN-TERMINATED
   104	                except for the last PHYSICAL drive on the CABLE which must 
   105	                be TERMINATED.
   106	
   107	    2.  A HOST ADAPTER WITH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL DRIVES
   108	
   109	        This setup is a little bit trickier. If you have a host adapter that
   110	        connects internal drives as well as external drives, the HOST ADAPTER
   111	        must be UN-TERMINATED, the LAST drive on the INTERNAL cable must be
   112	        TERMINATED, and the LAST drive on the EXTERNAL cable must be 
   113	        TERMINATED also.
   114	
   115	        Therefore, your configuration would look like this.
   116	                                 ____
   117	                Internal        /    \         External
   118	           DEVICE====DEVICE====| HOST |====DEVICE====DEVICE
   119	             |         |        \____/        |         |
   120	             |         |          |           |         |
   121	             |         |    UN-TERMINATED     |         |
   122	         TERMINATED    |                      |     TERMINATED 
   123	                       |                      |
   124	                 UN-TERMINATED          UN-TERMINATED
   125	
   126	        So once again, if you have drives on both ends of the controller card,
   127	        the controller card must be UN-TERMINATED, and the last drive on each
   128	        end of the SCSI BUS (Cable) must be TERMINATED.
   129	
   130	
   131	CABLE INSTALLATION
   132	------------------
   133	
   134	        Once the two above items are checked and configured, all you need to
   135	        do then is put the drive on the cable (matching the red stripe on the
   136	        cable to pin one on the controller card) and then power on.
   137	
   138	
   139	TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
   140	---------------------
   141	
   142	     PROBLEM
   143	         2 drives or 7 drives are seen on the SCSI bus when only 1 drive is
   144	         installed on the controller card.
   145	     REMEDY
   146	         Your drive is set to SCSI ID 7, which is what most host adapters are
   147	         set as the default configuration. Change your SCSI id to anything
   148	         other than 7 (also, you cannot use the same ID as another drive).
   149	
   150	     PROBLEM
   151	         When booting up the system, the machine gets hung up at the bios
   152	         banner of the controller card.
   153	     REMEDY
   154	         There are a few possibilities for this problem.
   155	          1.  There is a drive set to the same SCSI ID as the controller card.
   156	              Change the conflicting drive to a SCSI ID that is not in use.
   157	          2.  There are two drives with the same SCSI ID.
   158	              Verify that all drives have different SCSI ID's.
   159	          3.  There could be a bios conflict.
   160	              Change the bios address of the controller card to a different
   161	              memory location.
   162	          4.  There could be a conflict with add in boards. Check and make sure
   163	              that there are no memory conflicts with any add in boards or 
   164	              bios's, check DMA's, IRQ's, and port addresses.
   165	
   166	      PROBLEM
   167	          When you boot up, the computer gives you a message along the lines
   168	          of "Drive C not found" or "Drive 0 not found".
   169	      REMEDY
   170	          Check your system CMOS. Set both drive 0 and drive 1 to 
   171	          "Not Installed" or 0. CMOS drive settings are for ESDI drives only
   172	          so if you don't have an ESDI drive, it will cause havoc on your
   173	          system.
   174	
   175	      PROBLEM
   176	          Drive does not appear to spin up or power-on.
   177	      REMEDY
   178	          Check to see if the power cable is connected and if power is actually
   179	          on. Believe it or not, this is a re-occuring problem.
   180	          If the drive still fails to spin up, check the self test seqence.
   181	          Remove the SCSI cable from the drive and power it on. On the front
   182	          of the drive there is a LED which will blink in a certain sequence.
   183	          If the drive is 'healthy' the light sequence consist of 1 long blink
   184	          and 3 short. If you get anything else or you get a repeating pattern,
   185	          then the drive may be defective and you should call our technical
   186	          support department for further advice.
