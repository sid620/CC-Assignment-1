     1	CUPERTINO, Calif. -- January 13,1992 -- Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ:SYMC)
     2	today announced The Norton AntiVirus version 2.0 for DOS and Windows. It
     3	finds and repairs over 1,000 viruses and strains, and detects unknown
     4	viruses. The Norton AntiVirus offers fast scanning speed, provides
     5	automatic protection in the background and uses a scanner that requires as
     6	little as lK RAM. It includes complete Windows operation, recursive scan
     7	and repair, and configurable protection options.
     8	
     9	The Norton AntiVirus offers unmatched virus update protection, including
    10	easy user addition of new virus definitions. Corporate-wide virus defense
    11	features allow standardized virus safeguards for an entire company. The
    12	Norton AntiVirus provides more complete network server support than any
    13	other virus protection program.
    14	
    15	"With the number of viruses growing at a rate of about 20 per week, timely
    16	virus definition updates become a critical factor," said Rod Turner,
    17	executive vice-president of Symantec's Peter Norton Group. "Symantec's
    18	comprehensive virus update services provide the fast turnaround that users
    19	need."

    21	Key Features 
    22	============
    23	Full Windows Operation 
    24	
    25	The Norton AntiVirus version 2.0 includes virus defense for both DOS and
    26	Windows. Pop-up Virus Alert dialogue boxes provide comprehensive,
    27	multi-tasking protection under Windows. Windows Scan Clinic lets users
    28	scan for viruses, repair or remove infected files, add new virus
    29	definitions and set configuration options.
    30	
    31	Automatic Protection 
    32	
    33	Whether in DOS or Windows, The Norton AntiVirus provides automatic,
    34	transparent and continuous protection in the background without
    35	interfering with the user's daily work. This allows even novice users to
    36	have full protection against virus infections. It constantly monitors file
    37	activity and alerts the user only when a virus is detected.
    38	
    39	Network Protection 
    40	
    41	The Norton AntiVirus offers the broadest range of network virus protection
    42	found in a single product. It intercepts infected files that attempt to
    43	launch on a network drive, it offers complete unattended scanning and DOS
    44	error level reporting. It is network compatible with Novell NetWare 286 &
    45	386, 3COM 3+0pen, OS/2 LAN Manager, Banyan Vines and AT&T Starlan.
    46	
    47	Immediate Virus Update Protection 
    48	
    49	Continuous new virus updates are available through Symantec's Virus
    50	Newsline (408/252-3993), Symantec's 24-hour Virus Faxline (310/575-5018),
    51	Symantec BBS (408/973-9598 or 9834) and Compuserve. A new Virus Definition
    52	Disk Service is also available for $12 plus tax. Norton AntiVirus
    53	customers can obtain the update disk by calling (800) 343-4714, ext. 756.
    54	
    55	User addition of new virus definitions is easily done with a single menu
    56	selection. The Norton AntiVirus lists the viruses it protects against and
    57	automatically updates the list as more definitions are added.
    58	
    59	Comprehensive Virus Defense 
    60	
    61	The Norton AntiVirus detects unknown viruses by tracking unusual virus like
    62	behavior. An encrypted fingerprinting file provides additional security
    63	against unknown viruses. Intelligent virus fingerprinting detects changes
    64	to files caused by viruses, even when the file size does not change.
    65	
    66	A file may be infected with more than one virus; some viruses can infect a
    67	file many times. With The Norton AntiVirus' new recursive scanning, a user
    68	scans the file once and the product keeps removing viruses until the file
    69	is clean. The Norton AntiVirus provides configurable protection options
    70	which give the user speed, security and memory size choices for optimum
    71	performance.
    72	
    73	At installation, The Norton AntiVirus stores vital system information on a
    74	Rescue Disk (either on floppy or network drives). If a virus destroys this
    75	important information (CMOS, Boot Record, partition tables) the user's
    76	system can be recovered using the Rescue Disk.
    77	
    78	Corporate Virus Defense 
    79	
    80	MIS/PC coordinators can utilize the flexibility of The Norton AntiVirus to
    81	establish company-wide virus safeguards. The Norton AntiVirus includes a
    82	wide array of command line options for highly automated operation on both
    83	standalone and networked PCs. Customizable virus alert messages give
    84	organizations the ability to implement their own virus response
    85	instructions. Password protection restricts access to program
    86	configuration options, ensuring consistent protection. The Norton
    87	AntiVirus also provides audit trails to track all virus-related activity.
    88
