     2	                     ===ECHOMAIL TUTORIAL===
     3	
     4	              This is a brief  tutorial  about  a  new  Fido 
     5	         phenomena  called EchoMail.  The first half of this 
     6	         tutorial is for users.  It explains how  you  enter 
     7	         messages,  and  use  EchoMail  to  send messages to 
     8	         others. The second half is for EchoMail sysops.  It 
     9	         is  to  explain  how  to implement EchoMail on your 
    10	         board.  
    11	         
    12	         
    13	                       ===USER'S TUTORIAL===
    14	         
    15	              What EchoMail does for you  is  allow  you  to 
    16	         talk  to  people  on  other  Fido boards across the 
    17	         country without having to know who,  or where  they 
    18	         are.  You  can  tell an EchoMail Area from the Area 
    19	         Name.  It will say something about  echo,  mirrors, 
    20	         national  conference,  etc.  All  you have to do is 
    21	         enter a message in one of these areas,  and  it  is 
    22	         automatically  sent  out to any and all Fido boards 
    23	         participating in that particular area.  
    24	
    25	                 ===CAUTION! PRIVATE MESSAGES ECHO===
    26	              
    27	              All the messages in each echo  area  are  sent 
    28	         out  to  other  boards,  even  if  they are labeled 
    29	         private.  Also,  anyone with Sysop  priveleges  can 
    30	         read a private message. Beware! If you want to send 
    31	         a  private  message to someone,  try to use another 
    32	         area besides an Echo Area.  
    33	
    34	              ===IF YOU DO NOT WANT A MESSAGE ECHOED===
    35	
    36	              EchoMail does provide a way to enter a message 
    37	         into an area and  have  it  stay  locally  on  that 
    38	         board. In order to do that, you enter a key word on 
    39	         the  first  line  of the message.  If you enter the 
    40	         word 'NOECHO' as the first line of a  message,  all 
    41	         in caps,  without leading spaces,  the message will 
    42	         appear in that  area  only  on  the  board  it  was 
    43	         entered on.  
    44	
    45	              Now,  all  you have to do to use EchoMail,  is 
    46	         read the messages in the Echo Areas,  and enter  or 
    47	         reply  to  them.  EchoMail  takes care of the rest.  
    48	         Please participate in EchoMail with us.  We provide 
    49	         this as a sevice,  and would really enjoy seeing it 
    50	         put to use. Enjoy!  
    51	
    52	                ===ODDITIES AND IDEOSYNCHROSIES===
    53	
    54	              At the end of each message in  an  Echo  Area, 
    55	         there are several lines of information  about  that 
    56	         particular message's travel across the country. The 
    57	         first  is call the Origin line,  and shows the name 
    58	         of the board that the message was entered on.  That 
    59	         name may or may not be a familiar name to  you.  At 
    60	         the  end  of  the  line  there  are  two numbers in 
    61	         parenthesis separated by a slash (/).  This is  the 
    62	         address  of  the  originating  bulletin board.  The 
    63	         first number is called  the  net  number,  and  the 
    64	         second  is  called the node number.  The net number 
    65	         defines a geographical area.  I.E.  Dallas  is  net 
    66	         124. The node number refers to the particular board 
    67	         within  that area that originally sent the message.  
    68	         This board number is 210. You can find a listing of 
    69	         all the net/node numbers in the entire world  in  a 
    70	         file  called  'FIDOLIST.BBS'  on  almost  any  Fido 
    71	         board.  
    72	         
    73	              The rest of  the  message  is  composed  of  a 
    74	         series  of lines that start with the keyword 'SEEN-
    75	         BY'.  This is a list of Fido  net/nodes  that  have 
    76	         already received that message. This is how EchoMail 
    77	         tells whether it has already sent a message or not.  
    78	         You can usually ignore the information in the seen-
    79	         by  line  unless you are trying to figure out how a 
    80	         message got from there to here. The seen-by is used 
    81	         by the sysop to determine  if  he  is  distributing 
    82	         mail to all the nodes as efficiently as possible.  
    83	
    84	              Sometimes  you will see the same message twice 
    85	         in an Echo Area.  This is the most annoying part of 
    86	         using  an  EchoMail  area.  Since the messages pass 
    87	         from  node  to  node  through  the   phone   lines, 
    88	         sometimes  a  message  get  garbled or not all of a 
    89	         group of messages get passed down  the  line.  When 
    90	         this  happens,  Fido decides it is better to resend 
    91	         all the messages and make sure  at  least  one  set 
    92	         gets  through  intact.  Sometimes  this  results in 
    93	         having the same message sent twice.  
    94	
    95	              The rest of this tutorial is designed to  help 
    96	         new  sysops set up an EchoMail area on there board.  
    97	         Unless you are trying to set up a Fido or EchoMail, 
    98	         you can press Control-C or Control-K to  return  to 
    99	         the   board   now.   I   hope  you  enjoy  national 
   100	         conferencing with EchoMail!  
   101	
   102	
   103	                   ===NEW ECHOSYSOP'S TUTORIAL===
   104	
   105	              If you are a  Fido  sysop  trying  to  set  up 
   106	         EchoMail,  this  section should help you.  EchoMail 
   107	         allows you to  share  common  message  bases  among 
   108	         several  Fidos.  In  fact,  some of the conferences 
   109	         have a few hundred boards participating.  Echo  has 
   110	         added  greatly  to  the communications abilities of 
   111	         Fido,  and has helped a lot of us get to know  each 
   112	         other. The problem with regular netmail is that you 
   113	         have to =know= someone to send mail to, or you have 
   114	         to  be  replying  to  a message that they sent you.  
   115	         EchoMail  simplifies  this.   You  'hook   in'   to 
   116	         EchoMail, and the conversations are already there.  
   117	              
   118	              EchoMail  is not free.  Someone has to pay for 
   119	         transmitting  the  messages   just   like   regular 
   120	         netmail.  The  established  procedure  is  to  find 
   121	         someone either locally,  or in a low toll zone  for 
   122	         you   to   poll.   Other   arrangements   are  made 
   123	         frequently,  this is just the most common method of 
   124	         approaching it.  Unless the person you are attached 
   125	         to is using a business line to make his  calls,  or 
   126	         is  a local call for you,  you will probably end up 
   127	         having to pay for the service.  
   128	
   129	              On a per message basis,  EchoMail  is  cheaper 
   130	         than  regular  mail,  but  the  volume is EXTREMELY 
   131	         higher.  This means you can expect  your  telephone 
   132	         bill to increase dramatically if you decide to join 
   133	         in EchoMail.  However,  the information gained, and 
   134	         the enjoyment of having ongoing conversations  with 
   135	         people around the world far outweigh the costs.  
   136	
   137	                  
   138	            === HOOKING INTO AN ECHOMAIL CONFERENCE ===                   
   139	
   140	
   141	              Probably  the  first  step  in linking into an 
   142	         EchoMail conference is to contact your network,  or 
   143	         region  host.  These  people  are  starting to keep 
   144	         track of the participants in EchoMail, and can more 
   145	         than likely steer you to a person in your area  who 
   146	         is  carrying  the conference you are interested in.  
   147	         Start by sending a note  to  your  host  requesting 
   148	         information  about the conference you care to join.  
   149	         If he replies with a note referring you to a  local 
   150	         node,  send  them  a  message  including your voice 
   151	         number. It is much easier to set things up by voice 
   152	         than by typing at each other.  Eventually you  will 
   153	         get  in  contact  with  the local person,  and make 
   154	         arrangements.  Later in this document we will  talk 
   155	         about the specifics of implementing EchoMail. We'll 
   156	         leave  it  as  being  up  to  you and your EchoMail 
   157	         contact to make arrangements  about  times,  calls, 
   158	         conferences,  etc.  Needless to say, this will vary 
   159	         greatly depending on phone costs and  the  existing 
   160	         method of distribution in your area.  
   161	
   162	              If  you  cannot  find a local connection,  the 
   163	         next step is to contact the EchoMail coordinator in 
   164	         your  region.  These  people  are  responsible  for 
   165	         maintaining  information about EchoMail conferences 
   166	         that cross regional boundaries.  That means if  you 
   167	         are  looking  for  a link into the 'basket weaving' 
   168	         conference,  and it is only  carried  in  net  141, 
   169	         you're on your own.  Regional traffic is just that.  
   170	         If it is a  local  conference,  you  will  not  get 
   171	         information   for  linking  in  from  the  regional 
   172	         EchoMail coordinator.  
   173	
   174	              On the other hand,  if the conference you  are 
   175	         looking for is national in scope,  these people can 
   176	         be of great assistance in locating a link point for 
   177	         you.  The person from the following list  that  you 
   178	         should  contact  will  depend on the region you are 
   179	         in.  If you are in region 13, don't call the person 
   180	         in region 19.  
   181	
   182	
   183	               === REGIONAL ECHOMAIL COORDINATORS ===
   184	
   185	              
   186	            Region           Name          Network Address
   187	
   188	              10         Butch Walker           161/1
   189	              11         Don Walker             120/20
   190	              12 Pacific Not Assigned      Contact Jon Sabol
   191	              13         Gee Wong               107/312
   192	              14         Alex Hartley           100/500
   193	              15         David Dodell           114/15
   194	              16         Bob Hartman            132/101
   195	              17         Randy Bush             122/6
   196	              18         Wes Cowley             137/19
   197	              19         Jon Sabol              124/210
   198	
   199	
   200	              These  people  should  be  able  to put you in 
   201	         contact with someone who can feed you an Echo link.  
   202	         Currently the Pacific region is unassigned as there 
   203	         does not appear to be an  Echo  conference  running 
   204	         out  there.  This  is  a  case  where  costs become 
   205	         important.  For someone in Hawaii to participate in 
   206	         a  national  conference,  they  would  have to make 
   207	         overseas calls to get their mail. That would become 
   208	         quite expensive.  
   209	
   210	              Last, but not least, you can try someone who's 
   211	         name you see in an  existing  conference.  If,  and 
   212	         only  if  the  above  methods  do  not  work,   try 
   213	         contacting someone who is geographically  close  to 
   214	         you and is participating in the conference. Usually 
   215	         they  can  at  least  steer you to someone else who 
   216	         might be able to tie you into the area.  
   217	
   218	
   219	                    === OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW ===
   220	
   221	
   222	              EchoMail  operation  is  fairly  complex   and 
   223	         requires  a  considerable amount of processing time 
   224	         outside of  the  regular  mail  times.  It  is  not 
   225	         automatic.  You  must  set  up a series of external 
   226	         events to run the EchoMail  programs,  and  process 
   227	         your  incoming  and  outgoing mail.  This WILL take 
   228	         some time away from your normal BBS operations, but 
   229	         will provide your users with a much  nicer  set  of 
   230	         message  areas.  Besides,  most  of  the processing 
   231	         takes place in the wee hours of  the  morning,  and 
   232	         caller activity is low then anyway.  
   233	
   234	              Echo works by moving mail back and forth 
   235	         between your mail area, and the message bases you 
   236	         specify to be EchoMail areas. This is done using a 
   237	         control file called 'AREAS.BBS'. It must reside in 
   238	         your Fido root directory, and consists of the 
   239	         following format:
   240	
   241	         (line 1) <Board Name> ! <Sysop's Name>
   242	         
   243	                   Board name is the name you want to appear 
   244	                   in   the  seenby  line  of  each  message 
   245	                   originating on your board.  
   246	
   247	                   ! is a delimiter and is required.
   248	         
   249	                   Sysop's  name   is   the   name   to   be 
   250	                   substituted in messages from the sysop on 
   251	                   your board.  
   252	         
   253	         (line 2) <AREA_NUMBER> <AREA_TAG> <NODELIST>
   254	
   255	                   AREA_NUMBER   is   the  Fido  messagebase 
   256	                   number that you want to use for the  Echo 
   257	                   area.  
   258	
   259	                   AREA_TAG  is  the  name  that the message 
   260	                   base uses to keep it seperate from  other 
   261	                   Echo traffic.  
   262	
   263	                   NODELIST  is  a  list of net/node numbers 
   264	                   that you have made arrangements to  share 
   265	                   messages  with.  DO  NOT  ARBITRARILY ADD 
   266	                   NODES TO THIS LIST!!!  
   267	
   268	              This   repeats   for   each   area   you   are 
   269	         participating in.  
   270	
   271	
   272	              There are basically two programs that comprise 
   273	         the heart of EchoMail: 
   274	         
   275	                   TOSSMAIL moves  incoming  mail  into  the 
   276	                            appropriate message bases.  
   277	         
   278	                   SCANMAIL moves mail entered on your board 
   279	                            into the netmail area to be sent 
   280	                            to other boards.

   282	              Scanmail  is  run  right after a mail event to 
   283	         move messages out of the mail area,  and  into  the 
   284	         area you have chosen to hold a conference. Tossmail 
   285	         is  run  right before a mail event to move messages 
   286	         originating on your board into the mail area to  be 
   287	         sent to the other participating nodes.  This is the 
   288	         simplest method of implementing EchoMail, it is not 
   289	         the most  efficient.  Fido  is  extremely  slow  in 
   290	         packetting and unpacketting mail.  This will result 
   291	         in an extreme degredation of the  system.  You  can 
   292	         expect  a  delay  of  approximately 1 minute per 10 
   293	         messages of outgoing mail,  and  1  minute  per  25 
   294	         messages incoming mail using Fido to packet and de-
   295	         packet EchoMail.  This is significant since most of 
   296	         the national conferences average about 40  messages 
   297	         per day.  
   298	
   299	              However, Thom Henderson has provided us with a 
   300	         utility  that  packets  mail  without  Fido.  It is 
   301	         called ARCmail,  and will dramatically improve  the 
   302	         speed  of  your  pre  and  post  mail events.  This 
   303	         utility reads all  the  messages  to  a  node,  and 
   304	         creates  a  file that can be transmitted instead of 
   305	         the messages themselves.  This means  that  whether 
   306	         you  are  sending  one  or a hundred messages,  you 
   307	         still only use Fido to packet one message.  ARCmail 
   308	         runs  approximately 75 percent faster than Fido for 
   309	         packetting mail.  
   310	
   311	              There are  several  other  EchoMail  utilities 
   312	         that can make life a little easier.  KILLDUPES is a 
   313	         fast program that goes through a message  base  and 
   314	         deletes messages that have the same From, To, Date, 
   315	         and  Subject  fields.  This  is the biggest problem 
   316	         with EchoMail.  If it is not implemented right, you 
   317	         end up spending someone else's money to send repeat 
   318	         messages. Killdupes somewhat solves this problem.  
   319	
   320	              TidyMail  goes through a message base and does 
   321	         some similar things.  In addition, it can sort your 
   322	         message base chronologically if you so desire. This 
   323	         is a matter of personal taste. Some people like it, 
   324	         others don't.  
   325	
   326	              Seenby is a very important utility if you ever 
   327	         add  anyone  to  your  distribution  list.  It goes 
   328	         through and marks a message  base  as  having  been 
   329	         sent  already  to  a  group  of  nodes.  If you add 
   330	         someone to a message base that has 300 messages  in 
   331	         it,  you don't want to send them all out.  You want 
   332	         to let that person start  at  the  current  message 
   333	         number in that area. Seenby makes this easy.

   338	              This concludes this brief summary of EchoMail.  
   339	         If you have not captured this entire document,  you 
   340	         can  download  it  in  area  one  under the name of 
   341	         ECHTUTOR.DOC.    More   thorough   information   is 
   342	         available  in the documentation for EchoMail.  This 
   343	         is an overview to help you decide if  you  want  to 
   344	         start  EchoMail  on  your  system.  I hope this has
