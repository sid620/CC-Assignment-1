    19	3DO Unveils 64-Bit M2 Technology 
    20	
    21	
    22	NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 2, 1995--The 3DO Company today unveiled 
    23	its highly anticipated, next-generation M2 technology. 3DO's M2 
    24	64-bit architecture is designed to create a quantum leap in advanced 
    25	CD entertainment technology. Leveraging 3DO's high-end 3-D image 
    26	and sound processors and IBM and Motorola's PowerPC microprocessor,
    27	M2 technology rivals image quality and performance of workstations 
    28	and the most popular arcade machines.
    29	
    30	"It's a quantum leap for the industry in both graphics speed and 
    31	quality," said Trip Hawkins, 3DO's President and CEO. "We're raising 
    32	the bar again." 
    33	
    34	M2 Performance Breakthrough 
    35	
    36	3DO designed the M2 architecture to deliver breakthrough processing 
    37	performance and the highest quality graphics and digital video for 
    38	consumer interactive entertainment software. 
    39	
    40	"The M2 polygon performance alone is phenomenal," said Hugh Martin,
    41	3DO's Chief Operating Officer. "M2 easily beats many expensive 
    42	graphics workstations and outpaces popular coin-op arcade systems. 
    43	With its advanced graphics, video, and sound capabilities, M2's 
    44	powerful 64-bit architecture will enable software developers to 
    45	create titles that provide a whole new level of realism and engaging 
    46	experiences not previously available on advanced CD entertainment 
    47	systems." 
    48	
    49	Based on 10 revolutionary custom graphics, sound, and I/O processors 
    50	designed by 3DO, and an IBM PowerPC 602(TM) microprocessor specially 
    51	designed with 3DO interactive applications in mind, the M2 architecture 
    52	processes more than one million polygons per second. Each of the 
    53	multiple M2 processors is dedicated to specific tasks to optimize 
    54	superior image quality and performance. 
    55	
    56	These processors are supported by the powerful system resources 
    57	that M2 technology provides, including a 64-bit data bus, 48 megabits 
    58	of memory, and a memory subsystem capable of delivering 528 megabytes 
    59	per second. MPEG-1 digital video decompression technology is also 
    60	designed into the core M2 architecture for built-in VHS-quality 
    61	digital video capability. 
    62	
    63	"The superior price and performance of the PowerPC 602 is enabling 
    64	new classes of advanced home entertainment software," said Phil 
    65	Hester, General Manager, Systems Technology and Architecture Division,
    66	IBM. "Working together with 3DO, we've defined the 602 with unique 
    67	capabilities to make M2 the best possible technology for interactive 
    68	entertainment applications. 3DO's 64-bit M2 system architecture 
    69	will forever change the way people play, learn, and interact." 
    70	
    71	The highly integrated M2 architecture was developed from the ground 
    72	up and is the result of working with the world's leading processor,
    73	graphics, and audio system designers. 
    74	
    75	"IBM and Motorola's world class manufacturing process will allow 
    76	us to achieve superior performance through higher integration," said 
    77	Hawkins. "With the PowerPC microprocessor and 3DO's custom M2 processors,
    78	we have a processor family that offers truly next-generation performance." 
    79	
    80	
    81	Beyond the Bits 
    82	
    83	M2's revolutionary image quality and performance features will enable 
    84	development of interactive entertainment software that provides 
    85	an unprecedented level of realism, with richly detailed interactive 
    86	worlds containing multiple, complex 3-D characters. With photorealistic 
    87	images, high frame rates, VHS-quality video, and theatre-quality 
    88	sound, the M2 interactive software experience will be radically 
    89	better than anything consumers are familiar with today. 
    90	
    91	"The M2 capabilities demonstrated today go far beyond anything currently 
    92	available on the market or in development for the advanced CD entertainment 
    93	market," said Martin. "Feature like Gouraud shading, filtered textures,
    94	3-D perspective correction, and complex scenes requiring performance 
    95	in the hundreds of thousands of polygons per second, will take gamers 
    96	into a whole new dimension of realism and fun." 
    97	
    98	"With the first 3DO system, we delivered the very best interactive 
    99	entertainment experience for the home," added Hawkins. "M2 will 
   100	once again set the standard--this time for the 64-bit advanced 
   101	CD entertainment experience."
   102	
   103	Advanced Graphics and Video Features 
   104	
   105	M2 technology was designed to enable software companies to provide 
   106	consumers with complex, photorealistic 3-D worlds and characters 
   107	and full motion digital video mixed with computer-generated graphics 
   108	that move seamlessly. M2 will enable software companies to develop 
   109	interactive entertainment titles that offer lifelike graphics at 
   110	tremendous speeds with considerably more action than has previously 
   111	been possible in interactive titles. 
   112	
   113	3DO's M2 architecture includes several key features for achieving 
   114	breakthrough image quality and performance. These features, which 
   115	are built into and performed by the M2 hardware, will enable software 
   116	developers to easily and efficiently provide richer, more sophisticated 
   117	graphic images and engaging entertainment experiences. Software 
   118	designers simply apply these advanced effects to an image and the 
   119	M2 technology does the rest of the work. 
   120	
   121	-- Gouraud Shading and Lighting--M2 technology allows designers 
   122	to apply a significant number of lighting effects to an object or 
   123	scene. Light sources are then reflected realistically off of objects 
   124	based on where the light source is in relation to the object. Gouraud 
   125	shading is applied to the object to create the appropriate colors 
   126	and shadows in the scene. The result is images and scenery with 
   127	brilliantly curved and smooth surfaces. 
   128	
   129	-- Texture Mapping--Texture mapping is used to apply a graphic 
   130	texture to polygon-based models to give the modelled object the 
   131	desired look. 3DO's M2 texture mapping capability renders polygons 
   132	delivering more than 100 million pixels per second and supports a 
   133	wide range of data types, including video. 
   134	
   135	-- Filtering--Filtering is the process used to make objects and 
   136	textures appear smoother and more natural by averaging and softening 
   137	an image's pixel edges. Filtering creates more realistic images 
   138	while using simpler geometry. 
   139	
   140	-- Mip mapping--Mip mapping is used to provide a smooth texture 
   141	appearance as an object moves closer to or farther away in a scene. 
   142	Through mip mapping, the system dynamically uses different levels 
   143	of texture detail based on the object's distance from the camera. 
   144	The images will appear to scale more smoothly and maintain their 
   145	visual clarity regardless of camera distance, yet only the original 
   146	texture is needed. 
   147	
   148	-- Z-Buffer - A two-dimensional world is described by two axes -
   149	- X and Y, or horizontal and vertical. A three-dimensional world 
   150	adds a third axis, Z, which allows objects to be placed anywhere 
   151	within a three-dimensional space.
   152	
   153	When one object sits in front of a second object, the Z dimension 
   154	tells the system where each object is relative to others. 
   155	
   156	The Z-buffer manages complex objects intersecting dynamically and 
   157	enables automatic hidden surface calculations. The system automatically 
   158	knows for any given visual perspective what the user will see, and 
   159	therefore which polygons to render. For example, if a car drives 
   160	in front of a tree, the system automatically determines that it 
   161	does not need to render that portion of the tree which is hidden 
   162	behind the car. M2 Z-buffering is provided in the hardware as with 
   163	coin-op arcade machines and workstations, while other systems only 
   164	allow for Z-buffering to occur in software. Z-buffering provides 
   165	a big performance gain when using complex graphic models. 
   166	
   167	-- Perspective correction--3-D perspective correction takes the 
   168	Z dimension into account when mapping a texture to a polygon. The 
   169	M2 technology automatically modifies the textures in a scene to 
   170	appear with the proper perspective, based on user interaction. This 
   171	results in fewer artifacts and simpler geometry than for competing 
   172	systems. 
   173	
   174	-- Transparency--Transparency enables complex images and special 
   175	effects to be built with simple geometric models. The M2 architecture 
   176	also provides alpha channel support, which enables software designers 
   177	to control the level of transparency in a model pixel by pixel in 
   178	real time. For instance, one large polygon can be drawn and a texture 
   179	can be mapped with transparency applied to appropriate pixels to 
   180	create the desired effect. 
   181	
   182	-- Hardware-based MPEG-1 video decompression--The M2 technology 
   183	is designed with built-in MPEG-1 video decompression to provide 
   184	VHS-quality digital video capability. In addition to using digital 
   185	video decompression for playback, M2 treats decompressed video like 
   186	any other type of data. This advanced technique enables designers 
   187	to apply decompressed running video to an object like any other 
   188	texture. With this feature, M2 hardware has the video effects capability 
   189	of machines costing many thousands of dollars. Additionally, multiple 
   190	streams of digital video can be incorporated in a title at one time. 
   191	
   192	
   193	Software Development Environment 
   194	
   195	Software design expertise in developing 32-bit 3DO titles is scalable 
   196	to the new M2 architecture. As part of its M2 technology strategy,
   197	3DO has taken advantage of its current operating system and development 
   198	tools to minimize the M2 development learning curve. The company 
   199	leveraged and migrated many critical components of its 32-bit platform 
   200	development environment to the M2 development environment, including 
   201	its core operating system, enhanced with new 2-D and 3-D graphics 
   202	functions to enable software companies to produce M2 titles faster 
   203	and more easily than developing first titles for other new architectures. 
   204	
   205	
   206	M2 Product Designs 
   207	
   208	The M2 system architecture was designed to provide 3DO hardware partners 
   209	with the flexibility to produce products to meet a variety of consumer 
   210	needs, including add-on upgrades for current 3DO Interactive Multiplayer 
   211	customers, as well as integrated standalone M2 systems.
   212	
   213	"3DO was first to market with a 32-bit system, and others have adopted 
   214	our concept of the product," said Hawkins. "But nobody else has 
   215	anything like M2."
   216	
   217	The company expects to announce M2 hardware and software partners 
   218	and specific M2 product launch plans at a later date. 
   219	
   220	Based in Redwood City, Calif., The 3DO Company (NASDAQ:THDO) develops 
   221	and licenses advanced interactive technology to hardware and software 
   222	companies worldwide. The company's award-winning product design,
   223	the 32-bit 3DO Interactive Multiplayer system, was created to deliver 
   224	a breakthrough in interactive entertainment at an affordable price. 
   225	3DO also develops, publishes, and distributes CD-ROM software products 
   226	and peripherals for the 3DO system. The current 3DO system is available 
   227	worldwide from Panasonic, GoldStar, Sanyo, and Creative Labs.
