   583	                              How to read this catalog
   584	
   585	          ASP members have supplied product descriptions for each shareware
   586	          application they offer.  The catalog groups them by subject
   587	          matter and lists them alphabetically.  If you want to know the
   588	          name/address/phone for the author of a particular program, turn
   589	          to the index and look for the program by name.  You'll usually
   590	          see two page references: one describes the page where you read
   591	          about the program, the other mentions the page where you can find
   592	          information about the author (in Appendix A).  Just turn to the
   593	          appropriate page and scan for the name of the program.
   594	
   595	          The Association of Shareware Professionals does NOT rate members'
   596	          software for functionality or usefulness, nor can it attest to
   597	          the validity of any product description in this catalog.  That is
   598	          for you - the user - to decide.  Shareware, especially those
   599	          products authorized to carry the ASP logo, can be tested on a
   600	          "try before you buy" basis.  If the software doesn't meet your
   601	          needs, you won't have to worry about getting a refund.  (That's
   602	          the beauty of the shareware marketing concept.)
   603	
   604	
   605	          1.1  Minimum requirements
   606	
   607	          Every program description lists its computer and operating system
   608	          requirements (e.g. "IBM PC, DOS 2.0 or better").  Unless noted
   609	          otherwise, each program assumes you have a standard keyboard,
   610	          monitor, printer, and either two floppy drives or a hard disk.
   611	          And unless noted otherwise, programs written for the IBM PC
   612	          assume you have at least 512k of total installed RAM.  Many pro-
   613	          grams may also need specific hardware or software such as:
   614	             CD-ROM drive
   615	                         A device capable of reading CD-ROMs.  A CD-ROM
   616	                         looks just like a regular compact disk with music
   617	                         on it, but it has information on it only a
   618	                         computer's CD-ROM drive can read.
   619	             CGA monitor A video monitor capable of displaying CGA
   620	                         graphics.  This includes most "laptop CGA"
   621	                         computers, plus higher resolution monitors such as
   622	                         the EGA or VGA.  Some (but not all) of the
   623	                         described programs may operate correctly with a
   624	                         Hercules monitor if you use a "CGA simulator"
   625	                         program; consult your video monitor manual for
   626	                         details.
   627	             Dual 720k disk drives
   628	                         At least two floppy drives capable of writing at
   629	                         least 720k of data per disk, or, preferably, a
   630	                         hard disk (see below).

   635	
   636	             EGA monitor A video monitor capable of displaying EGA
   637	                         graphics.  This almost always includes VGA and
   638	                         other higher-resolution monitors.  CGA and
   639	                         Hercules monitors won't suffice.
   640	             EMS memory  Memory accessible via the Lotus-Intel-Microsoft
   641	                         Expanded Memory Specification.  Not to be confused
   642	                         with expanded memory, extended memory, or XMS
   643	                         memory (see below).  Windows, OS/2, and newer
   644	                         versions of DOS come with software designed to
   645	                         implement EMS memory on computers with enough
   646	                         installed memory.
   647	             Epson printer
   648	                         A printer capable of recognizing the Epson print
   649	                         command set (an industry standard).  Some
   650	                         printers, including some laser printers, have
   651	                         options to behave like an Epson printer.  Some
   652	                         programs may require a specific model such as the
   653	                         Epson MX-80 or FX-100.
   654	             Hard disk   A fixed-, removable-, or network-drive device
   655	                         capable of storing multiple megabytes of data.
   656	                         Some programs also assume you have at least one
   657	                         floppy drive in addition to the hard disk.
   658	             Hercules monitor
   659	                         A video monitor capable of displaying Hercules
   660	                         graphics.  CGA, EGA, VGA, & SVGA monitors won't
   661	                         suffice.
   662	             HP DeskJet  A Hewlett-Packard DeskJet or compatible printer.
   663	                         Some programs may require a DeskJet starting with
   664	                         a specific model such as the DeskJet Plus or
   665	                         having a specific feature like a RAM cartridge.
   666	             HP LaserJet A Hewlett-Packard LaserJet or compatible printer.
   667	                         (HP DeskJet printers recognize most, but not all,
   668	                         of the HP LaserJet command set.)  Some programs
   669	                         may require a specific model such as the LaserJet
   670	                         II or with a specific feature like the LaserJet
   671	                         IIIDSi.
   672	             Math coprocessor
   673	                         An IBM PC or compatible computer with an installed
   674	                         math coprocessor unit.  Commonly referred to as an
   675	                         "80x87 chip," these include the 8087, 80287, and
   676	                         80387 coprocessors.  (80486- and Pentium-based
   677	                         computers have math coprocessors by default.)
   678	                         Most 8086-, 80286-, and 80386-based IBM PCs &
   679	                         compatibles have no installed math coprocessor by
   680	                         default.  (80286- and 80386-based computers can
   681	                         accept a math coprocessor if you purchase one.)
   682	             Modem       A modem.  Almost all programs work with a "Hayes
   683	                         compatible" modem, specifically one able to
   684	                         recognize the Hayes command set (an industry
   685	                         standard).  A few programs claim to work with non-
   686	                         Hayes modems too.  Some programs may require the
   687	                         modem to operate at a specific rate of speed (e.g.
   688	                         "1200 baud").
   689	             Mouse       A Logitec- or Microsoft-compatible mouse.

   695	             Network     A computer hooked up a local area network (LAN).
   696	                         Program descriptions will normally specify the
   697	                         different types of LAN systems under which they
   698	                         can operate.
   699	             Plotter     A plotter output device.  Many of the described
   700	                         programs need a plotter able to recognize the HPGL
   701	                         (Hewlett Packard Graphics Language) command set.
   702	             PostScript printer
   703	                         A printer able to interpret the PostScriptr
   704	                         command set.  Many printers (including the HP
   705	                         LaserJet series) offer PostScript compatibility
   706	                         via plug-in cartridges.  Software also exists to
   707	                         emulate PostScript on hundreds of popular

   709	             SVGA monitor
   710	                         A video monitor capable of displaying SVGA
   711	                         graphics.  This almost always includes higher-
   712	                         resolution monitors.  CGA, EGA, VGA, and Hercules
   713	                         monitors won't suffice.
   714	             Streaming tape device
   715	                         A device capable of reading streaming tapes.  Also
   716	                         referred to as a "tape backup device."  Streaming
   717	                         tapes look something like a standard music
   718	                         cassette or videocassette, but it holds
   719	                         information only a computer can read.  Common
   720	                         streaming tapes include DC600, DC2000, DC2120;
   721	                         tape storage formats include QIC-40 and QIC-80.
   722	             VGA monitor A video monitor capable of displaying VGA
   723	                         graphics.  This almost always includes higher-
   724	                         resolution monitors.  CGA, EGA, and Hercules
   725	                         monitors won't suffice.
   726	             XMS memory  Memory accessible via the Lotus-Intel-Microsoft
   727	                         eXtended Memory Specification.  Not to be confused
   728	                         with expanded memory, extended memory, or EMS
   729	                         memory (see above).  Windows, OS/2, and newer
   730	                         versions of DOS come with software designed to
   731	                         implement XMS memory on computers with enough
   732	                         installed memory.

   735	          1.2  Registration benefits
   736	
   737	          All ASP member shareware products come with certain minimum
   738	          benefits when you register.  The author must acknowledge your
   739	          registration (you don't just get a canceled check) and must
   740	          provide a minimum amount of technical support for at least three
   741	          months.
   742	
   743	          Many authors provide other registration benefits such as a
   744	          printed manual, a master disk, a year of unlimited phone support,
   745	          source code, etc.  The product description will mention them when
   746	          appropriate.

   750	
   751	
   752	          In addition, every ASP member can offer the following benefits to
   753	          registered customers:

   758	                         register an ASP member's shareware product.
   759	
   760	          Many authors include this information when they acknowledge
   761	          registrations.  Contact the author if you need assistance.
   762	
   763	          Some authors add "registration reminder screens" to the shareware
   764	          version of a program as a way to gently remind people to
   765	          register.  (The ASP sets ethical standards regarding it.)  Almost
   766	          all authors will either send a copy of the program without
   767	          reminder screens, or will disclose a method to disable the
   768	          reminders, once you register the product.

   771	          1.3  Sample product description
   772	
   773	          This sample description will help you understand what each field
   774	          means:
   775	
   776	          Product:  Shareware Program Name                            [***]
   777	            A "[***]" across from the product name indicates a new or
   778	            updated description since the last catalog.
   779	          Author:  name & phone number of the person or company offering
   780	            this product.  See Appendix A for detailed information about
   781	            the person or company.
   782	          Version:  version number  (release date)
   783	          Needs:  computer type [IBM PC, IBM 80386, Macintosh, etc.],
   784	            operating system, and version number.  May also describe other
   785	            needed or recommended hardware & software.  See above for more
   786	            details.
   787	          Registration fee:  The cost of a single user license, expressed
   788	            in U.S. currency unless otherwise noted.  Many authors provide
   789	            "multi-tier" registrations, and you may pay a little more or
   790	            less than the amount stated here depending on your situation.
   791	            (You can often save money by "reading the fine print.")  Some
   792	            authors include shipping & handling fees in the prices while
   793	            others don't.  Most authors offer network, site, and corporate
   794	            licenses for a higher fee; please contact the author in
   795	            question for details and price quotes.
   796	          SWREG#: applies only to CompuServe users.  You can register this
   797	            product on CompuServe and have the cost added to your service
   798	            bill.  This method of payment proves especially useful for (1)
   799	            overseas users who don't have a credit card accepted by the

   809	          PsL#: you can register this product via the Public (software)
   810	            Library, and you can pay for it with your MasterCard, Visa,
   811	            American Express, Optima, or Discover card.  Call (800)
   812	            242-4775, have your credit card handy, and have the product's
   813	            PsL registration number handy.  (Overseas customers should call
   814	            U.S. 713-524-6394.)  Or if you want to fax your shareware
   815	            purchase order to PsL, fax it to (713) 524-6398.

   817	            tering the software.  All ASP shareware programs come with cer-
   818	            tain minimum benefits (see above for details).
   819	          Look for:  FILENAME.EXT on BBSs (call xxx-xxx-xxxx to download it
   820	            at no charge); FNAME.EXT in GATE:FORUM forum LIB 9 on Compu-

   824	          Download size:  the size of the file(s) to download, in
   825	            kilobytes.  A 2400 baud modem can download about 14 kilobytes
   826	            per minute under normal conditions.
   827	          Special instructions:  tells if the author limits product
   828	            distribution to the United States.  In some cases the author or
   829	            company may have signed a contract forbidding worldwide share-
   830	            ware distribution.  In other cases the product may only appeal
   831	            to an American audience (income tax software for example).  In
   832	            rare cases, U.S. federal laws may actually prohibit the author
   833	            or company from distributing the product in other countries.
   834	          Editor's note:  the catalog editor may append text of his own if
   835	            something needs further explanation.
   836	          Description:  a paragraph or two of text which describes the
   837	            shareware product in detail.  This information comes direct
   838	            from the author or company behind the program.

 17093	            Provides a much-needed text-based lecturing capability in
 17094	            Windows.  Replaces transparencies and foils!  Other
 17095	            presentation packages focus on graphics and overwhelm users
 17096	            with complexities and high price tags.  This program reads
 17097	            standard ASCII files and displays text presentations in a
 17098	            window.  Mouse support lets you walk around freely as you "flip
 17099	            slides."

 17102	            who give text-based lectures will find this program extremely

 21182	            Provides menu selection notification.  In other words, it tells
 21183	            you when the user has selected a menu item.  This is really
 21184	            useful for status bar style help.  Really easy to use.  All you
 21185	            need to do is place it on your form.  There's nothing to set.
 21186	            Events start coming in automatically.  The events give you the
 21187	            text and tag of the menu item selected.

 32636	          Description:
 32637	            No one really knows when PEG solitaire was invented. Some
 32638	            stories trace it to prisoners during the French Revolution, but
 32639	            published descriptions date at least 100 years earlier.  Most
 32640	            likely the game is even older.  This presents variations on the
 32641	            classic peg solitaire with multiple starting positions, and
 32642	            varying endgames.  One of the pleasures of playing the game on
 32643	            your computer is that you can quickly set up the board to try
 32644	            different strategies. Ages 8 to 88.

 33002	            A two-player strategy game played on a grid with two sets of
 33003	            opposing (red vs. blue) neutral and charged pieces. A player
 33004	            moves by choosing an initial velocity for one of his pieces,
 33005	            which then follows a trajectory influenced (for a charged
 33006	            piece) by the distribution of other charges on the board. The
 33007	            motion ends following a collision with another piece. The game
 33008	            ends when a charged piece captures (collides with) its opposing
 33009	            king.

 33051	            on a grid of gray and colored terrain squares. On a given turn,
 33052	            a player sets a sequence of up to four pieces in motion, which
 33053	            interact with existing terrain and modify it by leaving colored
 33054	            trails. Collisions between pieces cause opposing pieces to

 33056	            ends when all of one player's pieces are frozen. Players may

 33817	
 33818	
 33819	          18.1  Assn. Shareware Professionals
 33820	
 33821	            The Association of Shareware Professionals (ASP) formed in 1987
 33822	            to strengthen the future of shareware as an alternative to
 33823	            traditional (retail) software marketing.  It also serves as an
 33824	            information clearing house for its members and the public at
 33825	            large.  ASP members subscribe to a code of ethics and are
 33826	            committed to the shareware concept.
 33827	
 33828	            The ASP demands professionalism from its members.  Authors must
 33829	            acknowledge every registration (you get more than just a
 33830	            canceled check) and they must provide at least three months of
 33831	            support for their products.  ASP members must also live up to
 33832	            any other benefits they offer.
 33833	
 33834	            You can turn to an ombudsman for help if you can't resolve a
 33835	            problem with an ASP author or disk vendor.  Members must
 33836	            explain this in every shareware program & disk vendor catalog.
 33837	
 33838	            Few people need the ombudsman's help.  ASP members represent
 33839	            the cream of the crop in the shareware industry, but it's nice
 33840	            to know you can turn to someone if you think you got a raw
 33841	            deal.  Unfortunately, it happens - authors have been kicked out
 33842	            because of repeated complaints.
 33843	
 33844	            The Association monitors Congress for potentially damaging
 33845	            legislation and has sent spokesmen to testify before
 33846	            congressional subcommittees.  It has also taken on the respon-
 33847	            sibility of safeguarding the term 'shareware' itself.  ASP has
 33848	            filed motions in countries as far away as England and South
 33849	            Africa to stop people who attempt to claim it as a trademark
 33850	            word.
 33851	
 33852	            ASP members 'meet' online in a public forum of the CompuServe
 33853	            network (GO SHAREWARE).  Members send & receive messages,
 33854	            transmit files, and exchange valuable information.  Old hands
 33855	            in the shareware business pass along their insights to new
 33856	            members.  The group holds public and private debates and
 33857	            members vote on major issues by sending private messages to the
 33858	            Association secretary.
 33859	
 33860	            The ASP holds yearly 'face to face' meetings and appears at
 33861	            various trade shows around the country (including COMDEX and
 33862	            PC-EXPO).  It also provides speakers who lecture on every
 33863	            aspect of shareware.  You can learn more by writing to the
 33864	            Association of Shareware Professionals, 545 Grover Road,

 39086	
 39087	            This appendix lists shareware products now "retired" by the
 39088	            author.  Retired products no longer receive the minimum levels
 39089	            of support, and the authors have agreed to return any registra-
 39090	            tion fees sent in for the software.
 39091	
 39092	            An author may retire a shareware product for any number of
 39093	            reasons.  Some applications have outlived their usefulness;
 39094	            others may have grown too costly to continue supporting due to
 39095	            competition from other authors.

 39314	            This appendix notes the author of each program listed in this
 39315	            catalog.  It comes in extremely handy when you want to see if a
 39316	            given program comes from an ASP member, or when you want to
 39317	            know the current version number/release date for a program.
 39318	            Hint: look in the index for the program (by name) if you want
 39319	            to see a full description for the program or learn the author's
 39320	            address & phone number.  You'll find page references for all
 39321	            the information you need.
