     3	Welcome to Q/FAX!
     4	
     5	Q/FAX,  a  service of Quarterdeck Office Systems, allows you  to  receive
     6	technical  notes,  product information and upgrade information  right  on
     7	your fax machine.  Using Q/FAX is easy.  Here's what you do:
     8	
     9	1.  Read  through the list below and pick out faxes which are of interest
    10	 to  you.   Then pick up the phone at your fax machine and call (310)314-
    11	 3214.   Q/FAX  is available 24-hours a day, 7 days a week.  This  number
    12	 is  for outgoing Q/FAX service only.  If you want to send us a fax, send
    13	 to (310)314-3217.
    14	
    15	2.  When you hear the computer answer, use your touchtone phone to  enter
    16	 the  code number of the fax you want (from the following list), followed
    17	 by  the  pound  sign (#).  You may order up to three faxes per  session.
    18	 To  correct  an error, press the asterisk key (*) and enter  the  number
    19	 again.
    20	
    21	3.  When  prompted by the computer, press the "START/COPY"  or  "RECEIVE"
    22	 button  on  your  fax machine.  This is often the green button  on  your
    23	 machine.  You may then hang up and should immediately receive your fax.
