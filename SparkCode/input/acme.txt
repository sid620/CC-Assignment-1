     1	BOSTON ... A new series of microprocessor-based uninterruptible power
     2	systems, designed to protect networks and multiple computer installations,
     3	has been developed by Acme Electric Corporation.
     4	
     5	Acme Electric's new SM Series of UPS units are being introduced in 650, 800
     6	and 1400 VA power levels to match the requirements of most common LAN
     7	installations, according to Daniel K. Corwin, vice president and general
     8	manager of Acme Electric's Electronics Division. The user friendly UPS
     9	units provide complete backup power protection in support of multiple
    10	installations and network requirements. All units in the new SM Series are
    11	compatible with Novell and LAN Manager networks.
    12	
    13	Among the features of the Acme Electric SM series is an RS-232 serial
    14	communication interface for monitoring the UPS unit and the input line
    15	condition. The units are built with a 20 percent voltage boost capability
    16	that regulates voltage output during brownouts down to 90 VAC, without
    17	switching to battery operation. This feature prolongs the life of the
    18	battery.
    19	
    20	Four LEDs indicate whether the unit is "on-line" or "on-backup", if the
    21	batteries are charged or need to be replaced, if there is an overload
    22	condition, or if the unit is in the boost mode.
    23	
    24	The SM Series also features a Multi-Stage Diagnostics test. In this mode,
    25	the LED bar graph indicators clearly communicate utility frequency,
    26	utility voltage, percent of full load on battery, as well as remaining
    27	"back-up" run time available.
    28	
    29	The new UPS units carry one of the most comprehensive warranty policies in
    30	the industry, with a five year warranty on the transformer, two years on
    31	the electronics and one year on the internal battery, according to Corwin.

    33	
    34	               New SAFECON Software
    35	
    36	Acme Electric also will demonstrate its recently introduced SAFECOM
    37	software program at Networld 92 Boston. SAFECOM was developed to provide
    38	constant monitoring of the UPS units.
    39	
    40	Designed to reside in the Novell server, SAFECOM guards against loss of
    41	data due to power failure and low battery voltage. When a power
    42	interruption is detected, the software system will safely shutdown the
    43	file server and allow the network supervisor to close all files and
    44	disconnect all users. When power is restored, SAFECOM reverts back to
    45	monitoring the UPS unit.
    46	
    47	Founded in 1917, Acme Electric Corporation is a diversified producer of
    48	electronic and electrical systems for industrial, commercial and aerospace
    49	applications.
