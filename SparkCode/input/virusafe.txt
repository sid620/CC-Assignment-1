     1	Boston, MA -- February 11, 1992 -- At NetWorld 92 Boston, XTree Company
     2	(Booth #430) will expand its product line to include the most
     3	comprehensive network virus detection, prevention, and elimination utility
     4	ever -- ViruSafe/LAN. ViruSafe/LAN sets the standard for protection
     5	against known and unknown viruses and, unlike other programs, can even
     6	learn from unknown viruses to modify and enhance its defenses.
     7	
     8	ViruSafe/LAN has been created to work on all networks, including Novell
     9	LANs. The $595 utility comes with a license for ten users. New network
    10	specific features include: automatic Supervisor notification of a virus
    11	attack on a workstation and unsurpassed flexibility in installation and
    12	configurability.
    13	
    14	ViruSafe, licensed by XTree Company for distribution in North and South
    15	America, Australia and New Zealand, was created in Israel by EliaShim
    16	Microcomputers in 1987 to combat Jerusalem B (the first virus to attack
    17	microcomputers).
    18	
    19	After years of use and hundreds of thousands of worldwide installations
    20	(with clients ranging from the Israeli Defense Ministry to Hewlett Packard
    21	and NASA) ViruSafe has emerged as a Fortune 1000 and government standard
    22	in comprehensive virus detection, prevention, and elimination according to
    23	Moti Dover, President, EliaShim Microcomputers, Inc.
    24	
    25	ViruSafe/LAN, now in its fourth major release, has earned the reputation
    26	for being the most complete virus protection product available. ViruSafe
    27	is a "user friently product that can be used by everyone in your
    28	organization, it found more viruses than any other product tested," says
    29	Bob Cartwright, of Chevron Information Technology. "It is the most
    30	comprehensive packaged I reviewed."
    31	
    32	"ViruSafe/LAN is active, not reactive," explains King Lee, XTree Company
    33	CEO. "ViruSafe's technology does not rely simply on known virus signatures
    34	-- it knows how to detect activity prior to infection... as well as
    35	after." Lee adds, "ViruSafe is time-tested and the only total solution for
    36	protection against infection from known and unknown viruses on the market
    37	today."
    38	
    39	ViruSafe/LAN - The Complete Virus Terminator
    40	
    41	ViruSafe/LAN monitors, detects and removes viruses in memory, file
    42	allocation tables (FATs), boot sectors, partition tables, and root
    43	directories as well as in executable files (or in all files). The network
    44	utility works on both Net BIOS LAN and NetWare.
    45	
    46	ViruSafe/LAN is designed to give the network administrator unsurpassed
    47	flexibility in installation and configurability. For example, ViruSafe/LAN
    48	will display all the users on the network. From there the supervisor can
    49	select individual users and uniquely configure ViruSafe/LAN for their
    50	system.
    51	
    52	When the user logs on, ViruSafe/LAN will automatically configure and copy
    53	the appropriate ViruSafe/LAN modules to the local workstation and update
    54	the AUTOEXEC.BAT file (if desired). This unique time-saving feature allows
    55	supervisors on all types of networks to individually configure and
    56	maintain hundreds of users from one location.
    57	
    58	This module will also automatically collect and combine virus-checking
    59	reports from each work station and send it back to the server where the
    60	supervisor can monitor virus-checking activity.
    61	
    62	ViruSafe/LAN contains six modules -- Anti-Virus Resident Monitor, Memory
    63	Virus Check, Scan and Remove, Program Integrity Check, Disaster Protection
    64	and Recovery, and PC-Checkup System Information. All of the ViruSafe/LAN
    65	modules are self-immunized against virus infection. If they are attacked
    66	by a virus, the programs can dynamically reconstruct themselves without
    67	forcing the user to reinstall. All modules are available in the easy menu
    68	interface or at the command line. ViruSafe/LAN allows the supervisor to
    69	define when ViruSafe/LAN should be active -- continuously, when scheduled,
    70	or only run manually -- as well as which portions of the system should be
    71	checked.
    72	
    73	** ViruSafe Monitor (VS.EXE) is a totally-configurable, real-time
    74	Anti-Virus Filter TSR module (transparent to the user) which provides
    75	continuous monitoring. (TSR uses only 12K -- 9K without help screens --
    76	half the size of competitive products. And it will load high, occupying as
    77	little as OK on a 286 or 386 system.) If selected, VS will:
    78	
    79	ù Prevent unauthorized access to critical areas like Boot Sectors, Program
    80	Files and Memory.
    81	
    82	ù Prevent viruses from entering memory before they have a chance to
    83	replicate.
    84	
    85	ù Prevent any writes to your hard disk the first time a new program is
    86	executed.
    87	
    88	ù Automatically check floppy diskettes for viruses the first time they are
    89	read.
    90	
    91	ù Check for changes in memory sizes or interrupt values that would indicate
    92	a virus is present.
    93	
    94	ù Provides a virus-free copy function that checks any files to be copied
    95	for viruses.
    96	
    97	** Virus Check (VC.EXE) checks memory for any viruses and can be run from a
    98	batch file to give protection each time the computer is turned on. Virus
    99	Check can detect and neutralize known and unknown viruses trying to infect
   100	programs.
   101	
   102	Once it has determined the activity pattern and identifying signature of
   103	the virus, Virus Check can provide that information to the other modules
   104	so that they can update their own defenses. For the first time, new virus
   105	types can be identified and stopped instantly without having to receive a
   106	software update from the publisher.
   107	
   108	** UNVIRUS scans and removes viruses from all files and boot sectors. This
   109	is useful for users who may already have a virus and want to remove it
   110	from their system. In most cases, ViruSafe/LAN can safely remove a virus
   111	from files and leave the original file intact.
   112	
   113	** Program Integrity Check (PIC.EXE) registers signatures of user selected
   114	files (or all files) and boot sectors and identifies unauthorized changes
   115	to them -- guarding against known and unknown viruses. PIC can reconstruct
   116	the boot sector and partition table if a change is detected, completely
   117	neutralizing viruses.
   118	
   119	More Than a Virus Terminator 
   120	
   121	ViruSafe/LAN goes beyond being amazingly powerful by providing:
   122	
   123	ù Easy Installation -- Easy Interface. Simple user interface
   124	  includes mouse support and point-and-shoot menus.
   125	ù Creation of a "safe" floppy diskette to restore PC to
   126	  health -- if needed.
   127	ù Password protection to prevent tampering with the ViruSafe
   128	  system.
   129	ù Viewers to see memory or contents of boot track 
   130	  (to scan for virus messages).
   131	ù Comprehensive list of viruses and mutations with
   132	  descriptions of symptoms. (New virus signatures may easily
   133	  be added to the program.)
   134	
   135	Pricing, Availability. Requirements
   136	
   137	The introduction of ViruSafeLAN is accompanied by new customer service
   138	programs at XTree Company. New virus information and updates to the
   139	ViruSafe/LAN database can be downloaded from the company's bulletin board
   140	service (BBS). These updates provide additional virus identification and
   141	removal instructions for ViruSafe/LAN. In addition, a CompuServe forum
   142	will be available soon, as well as a fax service that allows users to call
   143	for the latest product and virus information. An update service will allow
   144	ViruSafe/LAN customers to receive quarterly updates of new virus
   145	signatures. All registered users will receive their first update at no
   146	charge.
   147	
   148	ViruSafe/LAN retails for $595 and includes a license for ten users. XTree
   149	Company also offers corporate volume purchase agreements and site
   150	licenses.
   151	
   152	ViruSafe/LAN is also available through the vendor's distributor network,
   153	which includes Ingram Micro, Kenfil, Merisel, Software Resource, and XTree
   154	Authorized Resellers, which include CompUSA, Egghead, Software City,
   155	Software Etc., and other nationwide chains.
   156	
   157	Other Products
   158	
   159	XTree Company also publishes XTreeGold 2.5 and XTree Easy, the industry
   160	standards in disk management software for the IBM PC, XT, AT, PS/2 and
   161	compatible computers; XTreeNet, the leading file and disk manager for
   162	Novell network administrators; and the just-released Xtree for UNIX
   163	systems, the leading file and disk manager for multi-user Intel-based UNIX
   164	applications.
   165	
   166	Project Green
   167	
   168	In 1990, XTree Company launched "Project Green" and became the first major
   169	publisher to produce software products using recycled and/or
   170	environmentally sensitive materials.
   171	
   172	ViruSafe/LAN continues the "everything except the floppy disk and the
   173	shrink-wrap can be recycled" practice. (The company is currently looking
   174	for alternatives to shrink-wrapping their products.) Further, for every
   175	ViruSafe/LAN user registration card returned, XTree Company will plant a
   176	tree in conjunction with the American Forestry Association's Global ReLeaf
   177	program.
