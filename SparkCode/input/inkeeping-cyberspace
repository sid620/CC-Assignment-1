     6	
     7	John Coate was for six year the marketing director and conference manager
     8	for the WELL.  During that time he was at the center of the social millieu
     9	that formed over time into what many call the "online community."  The
    10	following essay is a distillation of his experience there and the basic
    11	principles he learned that made it work.

    18	I. Something Old, Something New
    19	
    20	When you log into an online service, you use new tools for an ancient
    21	activity.  Even with all the screens and wires and chips and lines it still
    22	comes down to people talking to each other.  The immense potential of this
    23	partnership of computer technology and human language is in this blending of
    24	the old and the new.
    25	
    26	Language is so ancient a currency of communication that people of the Northern
    27	Hemisphere, from Europe to India, know of their common tribal roots mostly
    28	just by the remnant commonalities of the languages.  Through all these
    29	thousands of years (sign language excepted), language has been either spoken
    30	or written.  But online conversation is a new hybrid that is both talking and
    31	writing yet isn't completely either one.  It's talking by writing.  It's
    32	writing because you type it on a keyboard and people read it.  But because of
    33	the ephemeral nature of luminescent letters on a screen, and because it has
    34	such a quick - sometimes instant - turnaround, it's more like talking.  And
    35	this is where the online scene is such an adventure.  The act of conversing
    36	over computers is such a new twist that the lasting term for what it is has
    37	not yet been coined.
    38	
    39	The new with the old.  It is also new because you often feel a real sense of
    40	place while logged in, though it exists "virtually" in each person's
    41	imagination while they stare into a CRT sceen.  It's old because even if the
    42	village is virtual, when it's working right it fulfills for people their need
    43	for a commons, a neutral space away from work or home where they can conduct
    44	their personal and professional affairs.
    45	
    46	My work with the WELL in Sausalito, and 101 Online in SF, is about building an
    47	online version of what Ray Oldenburg calls "the Third Place."  In The Great
    48	Good Place he calls home the First Place and work the Second Place.  "Third
    49	places," he says, "exist on neutral ground and serve to level their guests to
    50	a condition of social equality.  Within these places, conversation is the
    51	primary activity and the major vehicle for the display and appreciation of
    52	human personality and individuality.  Third places are taken for granted and
    53	most have a low profile.  Since the formal institutions of society make
    54	stronger claims on the individual, third places are normally open in the off
    55	hours, as well as at other times.  Though a radically different kind of
    56	setting from the home, the third place is remarkable similar to a good home in
    57	the psychological comfort and support that it extends."
    58	
    59	I'll say right up front that my love for online interaction is because it
    60	brings people together.  At the personal level it helps people find their
    61	kindred spirits and at the larger social level it serves as a conduit for the
    62	horizontal flow of information through the population.
    63	
    64	In this piece, I will first describe some of the elements that can combine to
    65	create a village-like quality in an electronic environment along with some of
    66	the social dynamics at play in there.   I'll go into some of the basic
    67	Consitutional and legal issues that confront us and then I'll offer a little
    68	advice for anyone who is, or wants to be, the innkeeper, so to speak, of their
    69	own online service.  And, finally, I'll reflect a bit on some of my concerns
    70	for the future.
    71	
    72	II. The Virtual Village
    73	
    74	Who does it attract?
    75	
    76	Online systems attract independent-minded people.  People who think for
    77	themselves and many people who work for themselves.  Logging in is like a
    78	social coffee break for home office workers.  Freelancers, contractors,
    79	entrepreneurs, and others who, because they are always looking ahead to that
    80	next job, need to have their shingle hung out.  Many computer professionals
    81	who currently work for large companies still see themselves as essentially
    82	self-employed.  They are good places to run into others who may lead you to
    83	your next work opportunity.
    84	
    85	The text display that still dominates online systems appeals to people who
    86	love wordplay, language and writing.  And it appeals to people with active
    87	minds.  The classic couch potato just isn't going to be that interested.  Good
    88	conversation can be a hard commodity to find these days.  If you love
    89	stimulating conversation - what I like to call an "intellectual massage" -
    90	where would you go, say, after work, to find some people to do it with,
    91	especially if they weren't already your friends?  So many people have
    92	commented on how they haven't been able to enjoy such great conversation in so
    93	long.  Often not since their days of hanging out at the college coffee shop,
    94	talking till the wee hours about anything that came to mind.  A place to
    95	debate, joke, schmooze, argue and gossip.
    96	
    97	Many people have fairly specialized interests and to find people with similar
    98	interests, you often need the opportunity to interact with a larger base of
    99	people rather than just the few in your physical neighborhood.  And it appeals
   100	to people who have numerous interests because you don't have to go from club
   101	to club all over town to hang out and talk with people interested in specific
   102	things like boating or books.  You can get around town without getting up.
   103	
   104	And of course they are used by private groups to conduct ongoing meetings.
   105	It's an efficient way for a group to stay in touch, collaborate on documents,
   106	or plan other meetings and events.  One of the great strengths of online
   107	conferencing is how you can switch from a relaxing and playful kind of
   108	conversation to something serious or businesslike with just a few keystrokes.
   109	
   110	And then there are people who just have unfulfilled social needs and want to
   111	meet some people.
   112	
   113	
   114	Expensive toy, cheap tool
   115	
   116	Some people sign up, look around, decide a system isn't for them, and cancel
   117	their account after a few months.  But many stay on for years.  What keeps
   118	them logging in as a regular part of their routine?  Because there is a
   119	benefit to the person that makes a real difference in their lives.  Otherwise
   120	it wouldn't be worth the money.  If you are just finding a degree of
   121	entertainment in the various conversations, then it could fascinate you for a
   122	long time or it might get old pretty soon at two or more bucks an hour.  But
   123	if it helps you find your next job, or connects you with a new friend, or
   124	fulfills that need to have good conversation with a bunch of bright people,
   125	then it becomes a real bargain.  And that is the method behind the madness, so
   126	to speak.  Behind all the screens of sentences are real people making real
   127	connections that make a real difference to them.
   128	
   129	The mind pool
   130	
   131	Ask a question about almost anything and you'll likely get an answer or a
   132	reference to an answer very quickly.  It's a bit like fishing.  Throw in your
   133	line and see what you catch.  Everyone picks each other's brains.  The
   134	informal nature of online conversation encourages people's amazing generosity
   135	in sharing the things that they know.   It's a potluck for the mind.
   136	
   137	However, you may not have time or inclination for this rather serendipitious
   138	method of gathering information.  Cruising around the various topics looking
   139	for this or that nugget of information can be like panning for gold: you have
   140	to move a lot of rock.  Sometimes you just want to go in there, find what you
   141	need and get out.  Good search tools are essential to a fully-realized
   142	conferencing package.  A challenge in designing online systems is making it
   143	easy to use the system either way.  The truly successful design accomodates
   144	both approaches so that they may not only co-exist, but are interchangeable at
   145	any time.  Hang out and shoot the breeze over in this forum, then go over to
   146	another area and quickly zero in on the info you need.
   147	
   148	Related to this is the need to have a simple beginner's interface that
   149	allows you to self-graduate to a command-driven "power user mode" at
   150	any time.  Beginners aren't dumb.  Usually they don't have the time
   151	for yet another steep learning curve.  This is why most people don't
   152	learn to program their VCRs.
   153	
   154	Also essential is some kind of "bookmark" function that allows you to
   155	automatically see new comments since the last time you logged in.
   156	
   157	The sysops don't create the information and sell it to everyone, the people
   158	themselves create the information and share it with each other.  In a way we
   159	who manage systems are like operators of a picnic ground.  We provide the
   160	tables and the people bring the food.
   161	
   162	Unlike network TV or mass market magazines or even parts of other large online
   163	services, the information doesn't flow in a top-down manner, but rather
   164	horizontally among the peer group of the participants.  I like to call it a
   165	People's Think Tank.  People join online systems because they are useful
   166	personal tools.  The horizontal information flow is really a by-product of
   167	this, but it has, I believe, a deep and abiding importance to all of us.
   168	Because the free flow of information among the people is essential to the
   169	health of a democratic society.
   170	
   171	The sense of place
   172	
   173	But something more is going on here.  Dry terms like "think tank",
   174	"information exchange" and "conferencing network" are too flat, too
   175	monodimensional.  They don't convey the reality that while you and the other
   176	people logged in are separated by miles of phone lines looking at CRT screens
   177	that just display written words, it feels like a real place in there. And
   178	those terms don't show that it's just about the easiest way to meet new people
   179	that there is. Nor do they describe how, via all this online talk,  people
   180	form and sustain relationships.  This is when it crosses over into something
   181	else, something fuller, something more like a community.  In attempts to
   182	accurately describe this we conjure up familiar images like village, town,
   183	neighborhood, saloon, salon, coffee shop, inn.  It's as if it is all of these
   184	things, yet isn't really any of them because it's a new kind of gathering.  It
   185	just helps to hang something familiar onto it so we can picture it.
   186	
   187	The tangible and the intangible
   188	
   189	The tangible part is the hardware and the software - the physical network.
   190	Obviously you have to have that, and it has to work reliably.  The intangible
   191	- the people part - is just as important because a system is as much defined
   192	and shaped by everyone's collective imagination as it is by the computers,
   193	discs and software tools.
   194	
   195	All of this descriptive imaging about community comes from real people meeting
   196	there.  But it goes much farther than that because travelling through the
   197	chips and wires, as a kind of subcarrier to the words themselves, is real
   198	human emotion and feeling.  The spectrum of the "vibes" is just about as wide
   199	as it is when people meet face to face.  It's sometimes harder to interpret
   200	them because there isn't any facial expression or body english, but they are
   201	there just the same and people feel them and react to them.  Furthermore, the
   202	quality of the vibes - the atmosphere, the ambience - largely determines
   203	whether or not the people involved will develop any affection for the system
   204	at all.
   205	
   206	Forums and hosts
   207	
   208	It's important for public forums to have hosts who welcome the newcomers, try
   209	to keep the conversations reasonably on track and do basic housekeeping so
   210	there isn't too much clutter and confusion.  They are responsible for
   211	maintaining some civilized degree of order in the conference.   Old extinct
   212	discussions are pruned out like tree branches. When people argue too heatedly
   213	and start tossing out the ad hominems, the host blows the whistle.  Every host
   214	has his or her own style and some forums allow a lot more tumbling than
   215	others.
   216	
   217	Conferencing is, by its very nature, a mix of organization and chaos.  This
   218	hybrid of talking by writing presents some interesting new challenges.  Both
   219	talking and writing have their unique strengths. With writing, organization
   220	and a high concentration of useable information are desired.  Online it's very
   221	useful to have labels for each discussion so you can get to the information
   222	you seek with efficiency.  It's pretty difficult at a party to stand at the
   223	doorway of a crowded room where everyone is talking and determine which
   224	conversation is most interesting to you.  In such cases, the benefits of the
   225	written word are strong.  When talking, the whims of the people take the
   226	discussion off on any number of tangents.  We have come to call this process
   227	of meandering "topic drift" and it often leads to the most delightful
   228	illuminations.  So much so that many people find this to be one of the most
   229	appealing aspects of the whole online scene.  But it can conflict with other
   230	peoples' expectations that a conversation will consist of material
   231	that is truly in keeping with the theme of the topic.  Once again,
   232	this is where good searching tools are necessary so that finding
   233	information isn't like something out of Where's Waldo?
   234	
   235	Seeing who else is logged in
   236	
   237	Typing a command that shows you who else is logged in at the same time lets
   238	you get off quick email to someone or engage them in a real time
   239	conversation.  But beyond that, it enhances the sense of "usness."  Seeing who
   240	is logged in at the same time as you is like opening the window and looking
   241	out to see who's on the street.  Some people check to see who else is around
   242	as soon as they log in.
   243	
   244	Anonymity?
   245	
   246	If people don't have to take responsibility for what they say, then some of
   247	them will say a lot of irresponsible things.  My problem with this is that the
   248	signal to noise ratio develops a poor balance. Fortunately, it doesn't really
   249	behoove most people to use false names anyway, since that would defeat their
   250	networking goals.
   251	
   252	But I'm speaking here about the public arenas.  I recently worked with a
   253	French-designed system. I designed it so the chat lines can be anonymous or 
   254	not, depending on how you prefer to do it.   If you comment in the public 
   255	forum, there is a way to look up the actual name of the person.  But you can 
   256	create a sub-ID that, if you only chat with it, is anonymous.  It can be a 
   257	way of playing games, or it can be a form of personal protection.  
   258	Both are valid.
   259	
   260	A wide variety of topics
   261	
   262	It's important to have variety.  And if you don't see a topic covering what
   263	you want to talk about, you should be able to open up your own line of
   264	conversation.
   265	
   266	What happens then is that you see the same people in different places and in
   267	different contexts, and fuller pictures of the people emerge as they reveal
   268	more dimensions of themselves.
   269	
   270	The relationship of email and chat to conferencing
   271	
   272	Being able to talk privately in email or in a live chat with someone alongside
   273	a public discussion helps people form all kinds of relationships.  It often
   274	starts with something like, "Hey, I liked what you said over in that
   275	conference and I have a similar interest.  Maybe we could talk more about it
   276	on the side."  In the heat of debate, people use email to form alliances, and
   277	when people are moved by a touching story or feel agreement with a particular
   278	statement, they use email to lend support.
   279	
   280	A variation on this private/public dynamic is the special-interest
   281	private conference.
   282	
   283	Encouragement of free speech
   284	
   285	While system managers or hosts usually have the ability to remove or "censor"
   286	a given comment, I generally discourage it as a practice.  And I especially
   287	dislike the Prodigy approach where they have paid censors who prescreen
   288	everything to make sure it conforms to their standards.   Better for people to
   289	speak freely and frankly to each other because when each individual knows that
   290	he or she may speak freely and that they in fact take full responsibility for
   291	what they say, then it improves the content of the system.  When it's working
   292	right, people wrestle with tough questions, and that corner of the larger
   293	society evolves that much more.
   294	
   295	I encourage all online systems to be places where controversial subjects may
   296	be discussed in a civilized way.  Of course, how you defines "civilized"
   297	determines what you will allow.  I frown on ad hominems, personal harassment,
   298	and threats but otherwise give wide berth to the variety of tastes and styles
   299	found wherever individuals gather.
   300	
   301	The face-to-face factor
   302	
   303	Members of many online services like to see each other socially.  A lot of
   304	online services host parties and get-togethers.  The WELL has sponsored an
   305	open house pot luck party every month for over five years.  Sometimes they
   306	have a special event like a picnic or a beach party.  A few times we have had
   307	some real big blowout bashes over in a big loft in San Francisco.  We even
   308	entertained a couple of them with a band formed from WELL members.  Recently,
   309	we organized a group visit to the local art museum to view a special exibit of
   310	Tibetan painting and sculpture.  We collected $10 in advance from everyone and
   311	they opened up the museum for us an hour early.
   312	
   313	On a smaller scale you can encounter someone online, start something up in
   314	email, and then take them to lunch, get up a card game, go to a movie, or meet
   315	them about a business project.
   316	
   317	When a number of the participants in a discussion have met offline, the
   318	overall sense of familiarity in the online atmosphere increases.  And this
   319	increases the sense of place for everyone, including those who either can't or
   320	don't want to meet anyone outside the online enviroment.
   321	
   322	Professional and personal interactions overlap
   323	
   324	This is where things really get interesting.  Ultimately, any network is about
   325	relationships.  I like to say that, rather than being in the computer
   326	business, I am in the relationship business.  Some are ad hoc, some are long
   327	term, some are for business and some are social. Get online for business or
   328	for pleasure.  While you can just do one or the other, most people use it for
   329	both.  I know people who got online just for fun but made contacts that led to
   330	a new job.  I also know people who joined for business reasons such as getting
   331	help on a computer application or doing research and made some new friends
   332	through conversing in other non-technical forums.  Or maybe you are thinking
   333	of hiring someone you met online because of their technical expertise and by
   334	seeing their comments in other conferences you find that you also like their
   335	sense of humor.  Or perhaps you don't care for their dogmatic attitude and
   336	that influences your decision the other way.  The variations are endless.
   337	
   338	One person who comes to mind is the radio producer who uses the WELL to talk
   339	shop with others in his field all around the country.  When his two year old
   340	daughter became deathy ill, he would log in from way out on Cape Cod and would
   341	report, diary style, in the WELL Parents Conference about what they were going
   342	through.  He would give the details and describe his emotional state and
   343	people would lend their support.  It comforted him and it touched all of us
   344	who read it.  And I doubt that this guy has ever met any of the other people
   345	face to face.  Furthermore, this experience greatly increased his enthusiasm
   346	for what this kind of network can do and that spread to his business related
   347	activities online.  Another described, over the course of a few years, his
   348	search for his biological parents.  When he finally found them many of us
   349	rejoiced with him after reading his eloquent account.  This guy works the same
   350	online crowd for his consulting business.
   351	
   352	For the term "village" to be applied to an online scene with any accuracy at
   353	all this blending of business and pleasure must be present.  Because that's
   354	what a village is: a place where you go down to the butcher or the blacksmith
   355	and transact your business, and at night meet those same neighbors down at the
   356	local pub or the Friday night dance.
   357	
   358	III. Social Dynamics
   359	
   360	Making communities out of individualists
   361	
   362	A lot of why the online realm is characterized with the image of the frontier,
   363	comes from trying to forge a community out of people who are not, by their
   364	nature, team players.  Back in the pioneer days, the rugged individuals went
   365	west.  These days the uncharted, unsettled territory is the realm of
   366	electronic group communications that is becoming known as the "virtual world"
   367	or "cyberspace."
   368	
   369	Here online we have people with a new sort of pioneer outlook.  Let me give
   370	you my thumbnail impression of what they have in common:  Many work for
   371	themselves at home or in a private office.  They possess great awareness and
   372	concern about their rights as individuals.  They are often outspoken and
   373	articulate.  And, on top of this, they are now doing a lot of relating to
   374	other people compared to what they were doing before, and in some cases
   375	compared to what they have ever done, certainly since their college or
   376	military days.  This is all more intensified by most people not really knowing
   377	each other before they got involved.  So this pioneer image also comes to mind
   378	because it isn't just new technologically, it's new for those involved at the
   379	personal/social level.
   380	
   381	Use of the word "community" here doesn't imply that an online scene is
   382	one monolithic community.  Rather, I use the word to suggest a commons
   383	that is made up of a bundle of smaller "communities of interest" that
   384	also have a common interest in the health of the overall system.    
   385	
   386	The level playing field
   387	
   388	The great equalizing factor, of course, is that nobody can see each other
   389	online so the ideas are what really matter.  You can't discern age, race,
   390	complexion, hair color, body shape, vocal tone or any of the other attributes
   391	that we all incorporate into our impressions of people.  I leave out gender
   392	here because gender is often revealed in your name, if nowhere else.
   393	
   394	If the balance tips to anyone's advantage, it's in favor of those who are
   395	better at articulating their views.  Some people are amazingly skilled at
   396	debating. Other people feel shyness around their own forensic or expressive
   397	skills.  Posting a comment is "stepping out," so to speak, putting yourself
   398	"out there" to people you might not know.  And many of them aren't going to
   399	reveal themselves because they are just "lurking" (reading without
   400	participating).  Related to that is the populist feel of it.  This is where
   401	the not-famous people hang out.
   402	
   403	Still, this is one area that needs improvement, in my view, and the search for
   404	an even more level playing field and a wider demographic base was one of the
   405	reasons I went from the PC-based WELL to minitel-based 101 Online.  Every
   406	PC-based online net I know of has 80% or more men.  And most of these are
   407	white men.  PC systems are not exclusionary.  But most of the population
   408	have the necessary equipment.  Few people buy a PC and modem just to
   409	join an online service.
   410	
   411	
   412	The meeting place
   413	
   414	I said earlier that an online community is one of the easiest ways to meet new
   415	people.  Certainly it is very low-risk.  I think this is mainly due to the
   416	essential informality of online conversation.  Rather than being required to
   417	sustain a single conversation with one or more people, relationships usually
   418	form out of numerous, often short exchanges.  In a way it reminds me of
   419	commuters who take the bus or ferry.  They see each other frequently but each
   420	encounter is of a fairly short duration.  In situations like this the pressure
   421	is minimal.  If you'd rather read the paper than chat then you just do it and
   422	don't worry about it.  But, over time, many people form enduring relationships
   423	this way.
   424	
   425	The "hot" medium
   426	
   427	In the online environment, just like any other social situation, the basic
   428	currency is human attention.  In the public forums, you communicate with
   429	groups that may have as many as several hundred people involved - even if they
   430	don't all make comments.
   431	
   432	Nobody comments on everything (although some people can be quite verbose!),
   433	but many people don't say anything at all.  In fact, most people who use
   434	online services don't post any comments.  They lurk.  In the world of online
   435	services theory the lurker/poster ratio is one of the indicators.  Ten or more
   436	lurkers for every poster is common.  Many people who do post comments are
   437	aware of this fact and orate at times as if they are addressing the Roman
   438	Senate, the online Continental Congress, or the lunchtime crowd at Hyde Park.
   439	I have heard online discussion called, "writing as a performing art."  It
   440	sometimes reminds me of Amateur Night at the Apollo or the Gong Show, because
   441	you don't know what reaction people may have to the comment you make.  Maybe
   442	you won't get any reaction.  Maybe you'll get email voicing support or
   443	dissent, maybe someone will take you on in the discussion, or maybe you will
   444	have said something good enough to warrant a string of online "amens."  At any
   445	rate, many are reticent to say anything at all because of this version
   446	of stage fright, while others take to it like Vaudeville troupers.  An
   447	online system is a place where you have to give yourself permission to
   448	step out and participate.  Of course if you talk too much people may
   449	tend to ignore your comments after awhile.
   450	
   451	Most services charge by the hour like a parking meter.  Combining this expense
   452	with the cost of the phone call can add up to real money for extended
   453	participation in the scene.  There are ways to cut the time spent online by
   454	"downloading" the material and reading it offline through your word
   455	processor.  You can compose your responses and then "upload" them to the
   456	appropriate topics.  But there are some people who don't want to do this, even
   457	though it saves them money, because the medium feels "hotter" to them if they
   458	are interacting directly online.  It's as if being online in the moment is
   459	reading the magazine and the downloads are like reading photocopies of the
   460	articles.  It just isn't as appealing to some people, even if it is cheaper.
   461	
   462	The personality you project
   463	
   464	Each person holds his or her own mental image of what the online society is
   465	and how it is structured.  The corollary to this is the personality each
   466	person projects to everyone else.  What you find here is that some people,
   467	viewing this as just another communication tool or social environment, try to
   468	make their online personality be as similar as possible to their personality
   469	everywhere else.
   470	
   471	Other people change their personalities once they get online.  This may come
   472	>from the sense of safety and empowerment they feel in the sanctity of their
   473	room or office talking with people that they know can't deck them if they say
   474	the wrong thing.  The online world might be where words can break your bones
   475	but sticks and stones can never hurt you.  Others may be self-conscious about
   476	their appearance or some other handicap and, knowing that it isn't a factor in
   477	the interactions, simply feel more confident than they do elsewhere.  For some
   478	others, the online environment seems to promote in them a certain kind of
   479	functional schizophrenia as if logging in was like Clark Kent stepping into
   480	the phone booth.  Having an alternate persona is part of the game and much of
   481	what makes it fun for them.
   482	
   483	I know some people who are much more bristly online than they are in person.
   484	And they enjoy the contentious nature of many of the conversations.  They
   485	sometimes even agitate it to be more that way, as if it was a kind of "sport
   486	hassling."  They like the ferment for its own sake.
   487	
   488	Ferment
   489	
   490	By its very nature, online discussion is going to involve disagreement.  In
   491	our reach for analogies we often ask "is it a salon or is it a saloon?"  Once
   492	again it's a hybrid.  It's a salon, certainly, in the classic image of
   493	gathering for spirited, bright conversation where people of different
   494	backgrounds and disciplines come together for that intellectual massage that
   495	feels so good.  But it's also like this Wild West saloon where you never know
   496	who's going to come in the swinging doors and try out their stuff on
   497	everybody.  Somewhere on the system at all times there is some sort of ferment
   498	going on.  Ferment is a necessary part of the recipe.  Part of the scene will
   499	always be in flux.  At times it will be argumentative and contentious.  As a
   500	host or a manager, you accept that, and work with it.
   501	
   502	There is concern amongst some participants that a topic or a forum won't feel
   503	"safe" to them.  This elusive quality of safety depends on a few factors.  The
   504	size of the group, the nature of the subject matter, the personalities of the
   505	people who happen to be in there talking, and the way that forum is hosted.  A
   506	forum environment that has a hostile atmosphere will discourgage participation
   507	by those who have less aggressive tendencies.  The hosting is important
   508	because in overseeing the discussion, you don't want things to sink down too
   509	far but setting too high of a standard for "niceness" can also kill off a
   510	discussion before anything worthwhile gets figured out.  That means that some
   511	temperatures will rise some of the time.  There will always be some rough
   512	spots whenever a group works to define itself.  Without any ferment at all,
   513	the "brew" will quickly go flat.
   514	
   515	"Flaming", in Net Talk, means to torch someone with your verbal flame
   516	thrower.  One gets the feeling that flaming gets to be even more of a sport
   517	over in the Unix net world than it does on a place like the WELL. They even
   518	have social protocols for it like saying <Flame On> before you launch your
   519	mislles.
   520	
   521	Some of the arguments and debates we've had over the years have been pointless
   522	personal hassles, but many have led us to a fuller understanding of what we
   523	were as an entity, or what we thought we ought to be.  It is important to note
   524	that policy and custom has been shaped at times by arguments and hassles that
   525	were often quite personal in nature.  Like everything else in a scene there is
   526	a lot of blending of different elements.  Disagreement about a point or a
   527	matter of principle can get complicated when mixed in with dislike for the
   528	other person's style or personality.
   529	
   530	The other side of this coin is the overt effort of people to lend affirmation
   531	and support to others.  This may be something as simple as complimenting them
   532	on something they said or wishing them good luck in one way or another.  It's
   533	like sending an electronic "get well" card.
   534	
   535	Newcomers
   536	
   537	Many of the regulars and old-timers know each other pretty well.  To a
   538	newcomer it can seem, as Alice Kahn once described it, like being a new kid in
   539	a high school.
   540	
   541	When the face-to-face factor comes into the picture, things can get thicker
   542	still.  People who haven't or don't see others "in person" may wonder if
   543	in-group tendencies get reinforced at social gatherings.  In reality, the
   544	opposite is true for many people such as Carol Gould.  She says, "My own
   545	experience at the WELL parties has been very positive.  I was somewhat nervous
   546	about walking up to the group of people, none of whom I knew, but I was able
   547	to enter a conversation or two and before long I felt fairly at ease.  People
   548	were curious as to who I was and, surprisingly, claimed they'd Tseen me
   549	around' on the WELL.  At any rate, my sense was that people were curious and
   550	friendly, and it encouraged me to come to the next event.  And I would have to
   551	say that I have never felt excluded or rebuffed by anyone."
   552	
   553	Perhaps it's just a clique in which everyone is a member.  As SF Chronicle
   554	columnist Jon Carroll observed, "I had a great experience at Howard's
   555	book-signing, which was my first Well event. I met all these folks for the
   556	first time, and the air was filled with, TYou meanIyou're onezie' and TI think
   557	that's rabar over there' and glad cries and furious conversation and the other
   558	people in the bookstore were like, TWho are these people?' In other words, I
   559	was member of a clique totally composed of people I had never met before."
   560	
   561	There is, however, always a challenge for the regulars to remember what it is
   562	like for a newcomer.
   563	
   564	It must be remembered by all that newcomers are essential to the survival of
   565	the group because they refresh the place, strengthen its vitality and replace
   566	the people who move on.  Without new viewpoints and personalities the place
   567	becomes stagnant.
   568	
   569	IV. Rights, Responsibility, and the Constitution
   570	
   571	These are the early days
   572	
   573	The image of the Continental Congress isn't really too far-fetched because the
   574	many discussions regarding rules, policies and customs of this new online
   575	environment are pioneering in nature.  Nobody really knows what the future
   576	holds, except that electronic communication will be a lot more common and ways
   577	of interacting in virtual space will have a lot more variety.  But it isn't
   578	known what social conventions, if any, people will observe as they try to get
   579	along with each other and conduct business in the electronic environment.
   580	It's all being debated and figured out as we go along.  Things determined now
   581	will surely have long-term influence in the future, when they are more common
   582	to the whole population.
   583	
   584	So that the best minds may be applied to the task of figuring out the social
   585	and legal issues of electronic interaction, we need as open a forum as we can
   586	put together.  Without the goal of improved communication throughout the
   587	citizenry, regardless of their opinion or station in life, writers and
   588	sociologists who express the fear that electronic technology will widen the
   589	gap between the rich and poor - rather than narrow it - may be proved right.
   590	Allowing maximum freedom of expression for each person or institution
   591	represented is the only way that enough collective intelligence can be
   592	gathered so that these matters can be figured out for the common good.
   593	Hackers and law enforcement.  Those who view their words as strict
   594	intellectual property and those who regard their online writing as so much
   595	ephemeral conversation and give it away as soon as they type it out.  Then
   596	there's the phone company and those who would compete with or bypass the phone
   597	company.  There are software companies and independent programmers.
   598	Those who believe in uninhibited free speech and those who seek a
   599	degree of control over what can and can't be said and to whom you can
   600	say it, especially regarding minors.  And all are really necessary in
   601	this widening national debate, because freedoms in the electronic
   602	meeting space have to be established by the people actually using the
   603	services.  Outside lawmakers or groups shouldn't be the ones to
   604	determine what happens in the virtual world.  If we don't establish
   605	the rules and customs for ourselves, then larger, more impersonal
   606	institutions with far less sensitivity to the subtler elements of this
   607	endeavor will have their way and we will be compelled to play by their
   608	rules.
   609	
   610	As it is now, there isn't much case law regarding these various issues,
   611	lending still more credence to the image of the "electronic frontier."  In a
   612	small system like the WELL or a huge one like Prodigy,  issues are worked out
   613	by making some rules and then seeing what happens.  Some things work and some
   614	don't.  In a way, it's hard to make many generalizations because the
   615	electronic meeting places are very much a bundle of individuals. Every case
   616	is unique.  Larger patterns will emerge producing more clarity over time.
   617	Still, there are a few general categories into which most of these issues
   618	fall.
   619	
   620	Free speech
   621	
   622	Is electronic conversation talking or writing?  Or is it a hybrid of these two
   623	that is unique and new?  And is this activity protected by the United States
   624	Constitution just like freedom of speech?  If this is a kind of meeting place,
   625	is it then an assembly of people that is also protected by the First
   626	Amendment?  I say that these are rights that must be protected.  But if it
   627	isn't in writing anywhere, are the safeguards actually in place?  In 1987 a
   628	bill was introduced in the California State Assembly to amend the California
   629	Constitution to include electronic speech in the guaranteed protections of the
   630	First Amendment.  The bill died in committee because it was felt that the
   631	protection was built into the existing wording.  I hope that it is true.
   632	
   633	Privacy
   634	
   635	Do your electronic files have the same Fourth Amendment protections from
   636	unreasonable search and seizure as your personal effects in your home?  Is
   637	your private email on a subscription-based service truly private?  What rights
   638	do you have, what are the responsibilities of the operators of a system and
   639	what are the limits placed on the governement if they should want to look
   640	through your electronic files and correspondence?
   641	
   642	In 1986, Congress passed the Electronics Communication Privacy Act which
   643	provides for some protection for the individual and defines the
   644	responsibilites of the system administrators.  Recent history (especially in
   645	regard to the Jackson Games case where government agents seized and kept a
   646	company's files and records without making an arrest, or more recently the
   647	seized "Amateur Action" BBS in San Jose that had downloadable risque GIF files
   648	that were apparantly available to clever minors who somehow would be more
   649	corrupted by them than a copy of Playboy hidden under their mattress) shows
   650	that the Government is testing its powers.  And the placement of limits on
   651	those powers is in dispute right now in the courts.  The Electronic Frontier
   652	Foundation (EFF) has been created by concerned individuals to help shape these
   653	policies and to help protect and defend people that they feel were treated
   654	unjustly by the Government.
   655	
   656	The ECPA made it a crime for someone to gain unauthorized entrance into an
   657	online system.  It also requires system operators to inform their customers
   658	about how much privacy they should expect and then insure that that privacy is
   659	not invaded.  Most system operators have unlimited "root" privileges that
   660	include the ability to examine anyone's mail.  On the WELL, and on 101 Online,
   661	we let people know that our system administrator has that power, but they do
   662	not read anyone's mail without their permission.  If an operator
   663	surreptitiously examined someone's mail outside the regular stated duties of
   664	system maintenance, then it would be a violation of the ECPA and hence, a
   665	Federal crime.  But what if the FBI came to our office and ordered us to give
   666	them a copy of everyone's email?  Would we have to do it?  What if they wanted
   667	to confiscate our equipment so they could comb through the files?  Could they
   668	do it?  According to the ECPA the answer is yes if they have a search warrant,
   669	but only if the material is more recent than six months.  If it's been
   670	on a system longer than six months, then only a subpoena is required.
   671	
   672	What this means in terms of Government power is that while they are limited by
   673	certain procedures, if they really want to, they can shut down your operation,
   674	possibly throw you in jail and otherwise wreak havoc in your life.
   675	
   676	This balance between the user, the system operator and the Goverment is one
   677	that is being defined a little more every day.  My feeling is that unchecked
   678	and unopposed power will seek to extend that power into new areas whenever
   679	they appear.
   680	
   681	Ownership of words
   682	
   683	Is it publishing or is it just conversation that happens to be in writing?
   684	The WELL User Agreement says "You own your own words."  This simple phrase
   685	gets right to the heart of the matter of intellectual property as applied in
   686	the online world, but, like all of these other issues, is fraught with
   687	ambiguity and is subject to myriad personal interpretation.  "You own your own
   688	words" means that you, and not the system operators or management, are
   689	responsible for what you say.  You take the heat, but you get the credit.  But
   690	does getting the credit mean that your every utterance is a standalone piece
   691	of copyrighted intellectual property that requires your express permission for
   692	reproduction?  Does the fact that anything you say in an online system can be
   693	downloaded and printed out by anyone who happens to read it create a different
   694	class of reproduction than quoting without permission for a commercial
   695	publication?  If a journalist quotes something from an online system and they
   696	don't obtain permission, did they steal it, or did they overhear it in
   697	a conversation?  We can't lose sight of the concept of fair use here.
   698	Like a publishing agent told me once, "if you think it's fair use,
   699	then it probably is."
   700	
   701	When I came over to 101 Online I changed the phrase to say, "you are
   702	responsible for your comments" and added that "claims against unautorized
   703	reproduction are the responsibility of the user."  I felt that the word "own"
   704	in the WELL's phrase caused some to misinterpret that the WELL considered each
   705	comment to be a piece of copyrighted intellectual property, which was never
   706	the intent.
   707	
   708	While I don't like to see people get too maniacal about what happens to things
   709	they type into a system because actual control is already just about
   710	impossible, and getting worse, I do think that good manners and consideration
   711	of others' wishes are critically important, even into the far reaches of
   712	cyberspace.
   713	
   714	Censorship
   715	
   716	If a system is privately owned, what are the rights of the individual verses
   717	the right of the owner to remove someone's comment?  Does a user of an online
   718	system waive certain absolute rights when they join a given network?  Are the
   719	owners of a system responsible to their customers and the right of those
   720	customers to express themselves freely, or is the system responsible for
   721	making sure that some kind of community standards must apply to the electronic
   722	dialogue?  Some of it is easy to answer because certain activities such as
   723	posting an illegally obtained credit card number or offering to sell
   724	controlled substances are clearly illegal and must be removed.
   725	
   726	But what about "community standards?"  Current obscenity law refers to "local
   727	community standards" having jurisdiction in deciding what constitutes
   728	obscenity.   But in the online world, where people meet in virtual space even
   729	though the participants may be located anywhere in the world, are there any
   730	local standards that even can apply?  Does the physical location of the system
   731	matter?  If the WELL were located in Dothan Alabama instead of Sausalito
   732	California, would it have to alter its method of managing the online society?
   733	
   734	101 Online bills its customers through the Pacific Bell phone bill.  This
   735	gives them more say regarding content than I think they ought to have, but
   736	recent California law won't allow them to bill if public access areas qualify
   737	as "obscene."  Obscenity is defined as appealing to prurient interests with no
   738	redeeming social, political, scientific, or artistic merit.  Before we
   739	launched 101, I got Pac Bell to agree to a standard similar to an "R" rated
   740	movie.  I can live with that because you can get away with quite a lot at the
   741	R rating these days.  Anything past that and you can take it to a private
   742	area.
   743	
   744	I feel we are in a good postition to test some of these issues because on 101
   745	a parent can create a sub-ID for their kid and then control where the kid goes
   746	on the system.  If you don't want your kid to go into the chat area then you
   747	can shut off access.  Same with the Forum.  I feel this is far better than
   748	trying to make everything conform to a so-called "family" standard maintained
   749	by paid censors, as on Prodigy.
   750	
   751	V. Keeping it Running
   752	
   753	Your primary job
   754	
   755	As manager of an online service, everything you do boils down to one thing:
   756	keeping the dialogue going.  In this sense it's like running a railroad or a
   757	cruise ship.  In those kinds of businesses there is the need to keep the
   758	motors running or, in our case, the modems running.  But the customers must
   759	also be pleased aesthetically as well as other ways that are not so tangible
   760	as making schedules and keeping the restrooms clean.  We have to have good
   761	quality conversations and the atmosphere has to be warm enough that it
   762	encourages people to open up.  You can't have just one of these things going
   763	for you; it has to run right and people have to like it.
   764	
   765	Being a service business means that success brings increased pressure to
   766	deliver a high standard to the growing number of people.  A service business
   767	isn't like doing a painting or making a record.  It's more like an airline
   768	that upgrades its planes as the technology moves forward.  The basic product
   769	needs to be constantly refined and made more efficient.  Furthermore, large
   770	sizes of people involved in the same conversation changes the dynamics of the
   771	conversation.  Growth means the potential for more good minds and hearts
   772	meeting and relating and sharing what they know.  But size could cause the
   773	conversation to deteriorate by becoming cumbersome and complicated.
   774	
   775	The real fuel that drives the engine of online interaction is enthusiasm.  And
   776	you work to build and preserve that just as much as you work to keep the
   777	equipment together.
   778	
   779	An informal atmosphere
   780	
   781	You need to have rules and policies, but leave a lot of room for judgement
   782	calls.  I like to run it similar to the way they referee NBA basketball
   783	games.  There actually is a certain amount of body contact that goes on, but
   784	at some point you decide to blow the whistle and call a foul.
   785	
   786	My feeling is that informality is essential to the healthy growth of an online
   787	community.  According to Ray Oldenburg in The Great Good Place, "the activity
   788	that goes on in third places is largely unplanned, unscheduled, unorganized
   789	and unstructured.  Here, however, is the charm.  It is just these deviations
   790	>from the middle-class penchant for organization that give the third place much
   791	of its character and allure and that allow it to offer a radical departure
   792	>from the routines of home and work."  Hence, I favor just enough rules to get
   793	us by and no more.
   794	
   795	Whoever's there: those are your people
   796	
   797	You can target and you can recruit and you can bring in your friends, but a
   798	lot of the population of the scene is self-selected.  And these people whom
   799	you, too, will be meeting for the first time are going to be your customers
   800	and, hopefully, your allies P especially if they are part of your host group.
   801	The trick is to make your alliances with the best qualities in a person.
   802	
   803	They aren't going to all agree and you don't want them to all agree.  If
   804	everyone agreed on everything, the place would get dull fast.  And they aren't
   805	going to all like each other either.  While it would be lovely if everyone got
   806	along, even if they disagree about a lot of things, it's a pretty unrealistic
   807	expectation.  So, you have to be diplomatic.  You will have to perform all
   808	sorts of little mediations between people, even if it's just to say, "aw, he's
   809	not so bad, really."
   810	
   811	The flip side of this is that when someone really special comes along, find a
   812	place for them so that the whole scene will benefit.  
   813	
   814	The big suggestion box
   815	
   816	Suggestions and advice happens at one time or another in just about every
   817	area of a system.  In that sense the whole thing is like one huge suggestion
   818	box.  While you don't have to do everything that everyone tells you, and
   819	ultimately you make the decisions, it is essential that people know that you
   820	are listening and that you not only listen to advice and suggestions, you
   821	welcome them.  
   822	
   823	You need a big fuse
   824	
   825	If you want to manage an online system that is devoted to the free exchange of
   826	ideas and opinions, then you need to have your tolerances set very high so
   827	that you don't melt down when the disagreement gets too thick.  There will
   828	always be people who disagree with your views or your approach and sometimes
   829	they may even be right.  This is your opportunity to show what you mean by
   830	tolerance, because you have to expect a certain amount of criticism and you
   831	can't freak out when you get it.  
   832	
   833	The light touch
   834	
   835	Computers and and other high-tech gadgets call to mind images of Orwell's 1984
   836	and other scary visions of people droning away at terminals while Big Brother
   837	determines their destiny and even their everyday actions.  Ironically, among
   838	those most concerned about such possibilities are computer professionals
   839	themselves.  As manager of an online environment you have a lot of clout,
   840	should you choose to wield it, so you need to be almost reassuring to people
   841	that you aren't interested in such heavy-handed control practices.  Try to use
   842	a light touch in your actions and in the way you communicate to people both
   843	publicly and privately.  Even if you are refusing to take a suggested action.
   844	People like to know that their views are respected and considered and that
   845	they won't be treated in an arbitrary manner as if they were a number instead
   846	of a person.
   847	
   848	"Innkeeping" for an online scene is a balance between setting policy rules
   849	based on your own vision of things, and finding the "sense of the group" so
   850	that you may incorporate it into whatever decision you make.  Different online
   851	systems deal with these matters in different ways.  Some won't allow any real
   852	controversy at all, to the point that they kick you off the system if you try
   853	to continue talking about controversial things.  Another has a set of words
   854	that, if included in a posting, automatically gets that posting censored.
   855	Some just knock out all the irrelevant comments as if they were a butcher
   856	whacking the fat off the edge of the steak.  
   857	
   858	Just about anything that smacks of heavy-handed administration
   859	has a kind of chilling effect on a scene that is based on the free flow of
   860	ideas.  People won't stick around if it isn't any fun or if they feel they 
   861	are being squelched.
   862	
   863	Censor, ban and boot: the heavy artillery
   864	
   865	The hosts of the conferences have their own challenge in keeping things moving
   866	and energetic without it getting out of hand to the point that people feel
   867	intimidated or hurt.  The atmosphere definitely varies from place to place
   868	based on how the host handles things.  There are different tolerances for
   869	topic drift or what one person can say to another.  Ad hominem statements are
   870	discouraged just about everywhere, but one host may, upon reading a comment
   871	that attacks the person more than the statement, censor the comment outright.
   872	Another may just get into the conversation at that point and say something
   873	regarding ad hominem statements.  Another may just let the fur fly.  The
   874	balance is tricky when you want to build traffic because some people will want
   875	things quite polite or they won't say anything at all, and some people won't
   876	participate if they think there's too much control going on.
   877	
   878	The second instrument of power available to a host is "banning."  This means
   879	that a user can be denied the privelege of commenting in a given conference if
   880	that person has sufficiently violated the guidelines of that conference.  This
   881	is a more serious action and one that engenders even more controversy and
   882	discussion than censoring.
   883	
   884	Finally there is the most extreme action: booting someone off of the system.
   885	In the six years I was at the WELL, we did this only three times.  I feel
   886	booting should be limited almost soley to deep and repeated harrassment by one
   887	person to another.  Harrassment, which means "intent to annoy," does
   888	happen online.  To keep it to a minimum and to let the one who feels
   889	harrassed make the determination, online systems should have user
   890	controls in email and in real-time interaction (like chatting) that
   891	allow you to block incoming messages from any given person. Another
   892	form of harrassment is cracking into another person's private mail or files.  
   893	
   894	However, in each of these cases the boot wasn't permanent.  Rather than 
   895	treating it like being exiled from a country, never to return, it is more 
   896	like being told to step outside of the saloon until you cool down.  Because 
   897	the point isn't to get rid of people.  The point is to try to make it so 
   898	everyone wants to stay and talk.
   899	
   900	The Management is part of the community
   901	
   902	For seven years at the WELL and at 101 Online I have been the manager of an
   903	interactive online environment.  The people, the discussions they have, and
   904	the relationships that weave into the fabric of community are the main
   905	products of my business.  But those of us who manage these products must also
   906	be a part of it.  We contribute to the discussions, we joke and argue and tell
   907	stories about ourselves and the adventures we've had.  We don't hold ourselves
   908	separate from the folks.  We understand that it involves the heart as
   909	well as the mind.  In that way we are akin to the innkeepers of old
   910	where the proprietor hangs out around the table and fireplace with the
   911	guests.  The whole place feels cozier because of it.
   912	
   913	But trust is not something easily granted by people; it has to be built.
   914	Particularly when the people involved are so independent minded.  For a long
   915	time I had the very strong impression that if I acted too capriciously or with
   916	a heavy authoritarian hand that a bunch of people would sort of turn and say,
   917	"oh, gee I didn't know you were really the Brain Police.  I guess I was
   918	wrong."  That used to hang over me like a Sword of Damacles.  Sometimes it
   919	still does, especially when there is some sort of crisis.  And the trust has
   920	to be maintained.  No room for being jaded.
   921	
   922	VI. The Future
   923	
   924	The Internet is growing so fast it can barely keep track of itself.
   925	Computerized communications reach more people all the time.  Surveilance is
   926	refined now to the point that satellites can track individual vehicles from
   927	space.  Photo images can be altered undetectably.  Laptops are more powerful
   928	than computers that once filled entire rooms.  Virtual reality.  Genetic
   929	engineering.
   930	
   931	We've been hearing it all our lives, but it still holds that never before has
   932	technology had the potential to do more good or more harm.  I might sound like
   933	someone back in the early part of the century when I say this but I'm going to
   934	say it anyway because it is the essence of everything I have learned about
   935	communication in cyberspace: humanity must dominate technology and never the
   936	other way around.
   937	
   938	Above all else, I want these communication tools to help; to be part of the
   939	solution and not more of the problem.
   940	
   941	To this end, I want to sound a warning about five areas of great concern to
   942	me.
   943	
   944	First, the cost of the phone call to an online service is prohibitively
   945	expensive for people outside of the local urban calling areas.  Even the big
   946	packet-switching nets don't go to cities with populations below about
   947	100,000.  This means that many of the people who could most benefit from being
   948	in touch online are priced right out of the market.  And we all suffer from
   949	not having the input and views of people who live out in the country.  I urge
   950	that we press for national information highways that are affordable to
   951	everyone.
   952	
   953	Second, our society has computer users and non-computer users.  While hundreds
   954	of thousands of enthusiasts dial into online nets around the country, the
   955	general population is largely unaware that such systems even exist, let alone
   956	as potentially important to them as their car or their TV.  Still, millions of
   957	dollars have been and are being spent to bring online communications to the
   958	general public in the form of dedicated terminals such as Minitels and smart
   959	phones.  Moreover, the phone companies and the cable TV companies are
   960	preparing to go to war over who will carry video signal to the nation.
   961	But for all the talk I have heard and all the reports I have read
   962	about hooking up the "global online community" little is happening to create
   963	systems where computer users and the general public can meet and talk on a
   964	common system.  This is incredibly short-sighted, in my view.  The real
   965	communication breakthrough will occur when those who use computers and those
   966	who don't can exchange openly and freely because access to the meetingplace is
   967	not confined by the equipment that gets you there.  The real system of the
   968	people will be one that combines these two worlds in a way that works
   969	for both.
   970	
   971	Third, I feel great alarm at some of the recent raids on hackers and sysops
   972	who, in utter disregard of due process, have had their equipment and systems
   973	confiscated before any proof or conviction is forthcoming.  This is nothing
   974	short of tyranny by law enforcement, especially in cases involving morality
   975	standards and not actual cracking or file theft.
   976	
   977	Fourth, ownership of media is becoming more concentrated every day.  Fewer 
   978	corporations own more media outlets all the time.  And it's getting worse.  
   979	Right now the FCC wants to remove the limits on how many radio and TV 
   980	stations a single corporation can own.  Cable companies have almost complete 
   981	vertical monopolies over the TV industry, from production to network to cable.  We watch what they want us to watch.  For freedom and democracy to survive, 
   982	we must increase direct communication among ourselves - the people.
   983	
   984	And finally, cyberspace is wonderful.  It has the potential to hook us all up
   985	in ways that most of us didn't dream possible only a few decades ago.  But the
   986	planet's wealth is increasingly concentrated in the hands of the few.  And our
   987	planetary environment is deteriorating badly.  Species are becoming extinct,
   988	global warming and ozone depletion aren't just theories anymore, and the
   989	planet's ability to sustain huge populations while resources are being
   990	plundered at unprecedented rates, is in peril.
   991	
   992	What I don't want to see is that this virtual world will become a substitute
   993	reality that serves to placate a population that accepts a world where it's no
   994	longer safe to go outside because the air is too foul, the danger of skin
   995	cancer from the sun is too great or the social inequities of the real world
   996	are that much easier to ignore.
   997	
   998	So I say that those of us who develop and use these tools in these still-early
   999	days have the responsibility to make sure that our work isn't co-opted into
  1000	some huge techno-pacifier.
  1001	
  1002	Rather, let us build into these networks a pervasive community spirit that
  1003	invigorates our society at every level, from local to global, with a new
  1004	democratic awareness.  I don't think I was ever more inspired than when I
  1005	learned that the failed coup in Russia was thwarted in great measure because
  1006	the resisters, holding out in their various enclaves around Moscow and the
  1007	rest of Russia, stayed in touch through an online network. Or more
  1008	recently when the people of Thailand used cellular phones to stay in
  1009	touch and organized after the military had cut off their phone lines.
  1010	In both these cases, popular communication was a critical element in
  1011	beating back military tyranny.
  1012	
  1013	Big wheels are turning around the world right now.  Let us make sure that we
  1014	work to help, and not hinder, this great movement toward democracy and
  1015	self-determination that may be the only hope for a world that, more than ever,
  1016	needs to talk freely to itself.
