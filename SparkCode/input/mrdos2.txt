     1	HARDWARE:
     2	
     3	CENTRAL PROCESSOR UNIT (CPU):  Heart of the PC - it contains
     4	the microprocessor. The CPU is a set of miniaturized circuits that
     5	does all the "thinking".  It controls the interpretation
     6	(arithmetic-logic unit) and execution (control unit) of instructions.
     7	It is this CPU in conjunction with RAM that comprise the computer's
     8	"brain".  The CPU does the "thinking/calculating" while RAM contains
     9	the instructions or "memories".  It is the CPU that largely determines
    10	the operating speed of the computer.
    11	
    12	BIT:  Smallest unit of information recognized by the
    13	computer.  BIT is short for Binary Digit.  A Binary Digit can
    14	be either a 0 or a 1.  Several bits make up a byte.
    15	
    16	BYTE:  A group of 8 BITS.  This grouping of adjacent binary
    17	digits (bits) is operated on by the computer as a unit.
    18	Computers use 1 BYTE to represent 1 character such as a
    19	letter of the alphabet, a number, a punctuation mark, a
    20	space, etc.  A BYTE is also a unit of measure since it
    21	represents 1 character.  For example, when the letter "A" is
    22	pressed, the keyboard actually sends the following to RAM:
    23	10000001  - a set of 8 bits.  See RAM, FLOPPY DISK.
    24	
    25	RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY (RAM):  A set of miniaturized circuits which
    26	represents the working memory of the computer.  This is where
    27	application programs (software) can be loaded from the outside and then
    28	executed.  The larger the RAM the better.  A typical single-user
    29	computer system may contain approximately 640,000 bytes of RAM.  (This is
    30	often abbreviated as 640k RAM: 1 k bytes is actually = 1024 bytes)
    31	
    32	The RAM is emptied when the computer is turned off - thus it is
    33	often called "volatile" memory.  WHAT YOU SEE ON YOUR COMPUTER MONITOR
    34	IS ACTUALLY IN RAM ONLY - a temporary storage location.  To make it
    35	permanent we "save" it, or "write" it to a floppy disk or hard drive.
    36	These devices are not volatile storage - they do not require
    37	electricity.
    38	
    39	READ ONLY MEMORY (ROM):  This is a special section of memory
    40	that contains instructions which are activated each time the
    41	computer is turned on.  These instructions are set at the
    42	factory and cannot be changed - thus, they can only be "read"
    43	not written to.  ROM instructions perform equipment checks
    44	and initialization of the computer prior to each use.
    45	
    46	DISK DRIVE:  The port in which a floppy disk is inserted.  Device that "reads"
    47	data from a magnetic disk and copies it into the computer's memory (RAM) so it
    48	can be used by the computer, and that "writes" data from the computer's memory
    49	onto a disk so it can be stored for later use.  Each Disk Drive is labeled
    50	A,B,C,etc because we often must tell the computer which drive has the disk
    51	with the information or where to send the information.  A Disk Drive reads and
    52	writes on a 5.25 inch or 3.5 inch floppy disk.
    53	
    54	FLOPPY DISKS:  The most commonly used mass storage device.  Allows
    55	entering programs to RAM and saving data from RAM.  Will hold data even         
    56	
    57	
    58	
    59	
    60	
    61	after the computer is turned off.  Data on these disks is stored in
    62	concentric rings called tracks.  The Disk surface is a thin piece of
    63	mylar and is coated with a magnetized material similar to audio or
    64	video tape.
    65	
    66	The read/write heads can magnetize and demagnetize the coated surface
    67	repeatedly.  Therefore, the Disk can be used, erased, and reused
    68	indefinitely.  An IBM PC disk holds approximately 360k worth of
    69	information (250 double-spaced pages of text).  This is called a
    70	Double-sided, Double-density Diskette.  Newer, smaller 3.5 inch disk
    71	exist which hold at least twice as much - 720k.
    72	
    73	FIXED DISK DRIVE:  Usually named disk drive C.  It is essentially a
    74	very large floppy disk.  This Fixed Disk (commonly called a Hard Drive)
    75	is secured within the machine and cannot be seen or transported.  The
    76	storage capacity is so large it is measured in megabytes (1M = 1K
    77	squared = 1,048,576 bytes).  Fixed Disks are available from 5M on up.
    78	The advantage is that it is enough space to meet most users' total
    79	storage needs, operates much faster than a floppy (5-10x faster), and is less
    80	likely to fail since it lives within the protected computer.
    81	
    82	KEYBOARD:  Input device that lets you enter data into the
    83	computer.  The layout is similar to the standard QWERTY
    84	typewriter keyboard, however there are many extra special
    85	keys that are defined by the software you are running.
    86	
    87	MONITOR:  A television-like device that the computer uses to
    88	communicate with you.  Typically the monitor displays 80
    89	columns (characters) by 25 rows (lines) of information.
    90	
    91	PRINTER:  Most users get at least one Printer for their
    92	computer.  It produces a "Hard-Copy" output of your data
    93	rather than just being able to view it on the monitor.  Dot-
    94	Matrix printers are inexpensive and fast and can draw
    95	graphics.  Letter-Quality printers are more expensive and
    96	slower but create pages better than typewritten (even
    97	pressure on each keystroke).
    98	
    99	MODEM:  Short for Modulator/Demodulator.  A device to send
   100	and receive computer output over telephone lines.
