     1	LAKE OSWEGO, ORE., January 1992 -- The first independent "hot line" to
     2	diagnose and resolve Novell NetWare technical-support problems is starting
     3	its third year of operation, and calls for help to 1-900-PRO-HELP" are
     4	increasingly complex as network users, administrators, value-added
     5	resellers, systems integrators and MIS managers move to larger,
     6	corporate-wide enterprise networks built around three or four servers and
     7	300 to 400 users.
     8	
     9	1-900-PRO-HELP and its related 1-800-YES-4TEC and 503-NET-HELP hot lines --
    10	all operated by 900 Support Inc. of Lake Oswego, Ore. -- are also taking
    11	more calls from users asking for help in connecting NetWare to a growing
    12	array of systems and multi-tasking environments.
    13	
    14	Today's diverse mix includes Windows, UNIX, IBM SNA (System Network
    15	Architecture) and SAA (System Application Architecture) and the Apple
    16	Macintosh.
    17	
    18	The calling trends indicate a marked shift away from the virtually
    19	homogeneous networking environment that the certified NetWare engineers
    20	staffing 1-900-PRO-HELP encountered at the hot line's launch in December
    21	1989. Smaller networks were prevalent at that time, typically configured
    22	with no more than 20 nodes operating almost exclusively under MS/PC-DOS.
    23	
    24	"The trends point to network users in the process of 'right-sizing,"' said
    25	Danton Mendell, president of 900 Support.
    26	
    27	"Right-sizing' is the migration from older, obsolete mainframes to a
    28	networked personal-computer environment, and multiple file servers. The
    29	corporation is replacing its centrally-located mainframe with an
    30	enterprise-wide network that links PCs," said Mendell.
    31	
    32	"It's a matter of economics. A LAN-based environment fosters competitive
    33	flexibility and improves productivity. A mainframe-based structure
    34	increases maintenance costs even as it frustrates the ability of a company
    35	to lead or adapt to changing markets and customer needs."
    36	
    37	The 900 Support hot lines counter the widening gap between the technical
    38	support that network users need and what is widely described as a crucial
    39	lack of responsive, affordable, expert support.
    40	
    41	Information Week, an industry publication, recently reported a survey by
    42	market-researcher Dataquest of 500 information-systems managers that
    43	showed widespread dissatisfaction with support from network operating
    44	systems vendors.
    45	
    46	"The 900 Support hot lines ensure that callers receive priority support.
    47	Callers don't have to wait for answers. It's the $50 solution to the
    48	$50,000 network problem, even with the changes underway in networking,"
    49	said Mendell.
    50	
    51	The three hot lines provide callers with instant access to certified
    52	NetWare engineers -- around the clock and seven days a week -- for just
    53	$2.99 a minute.
    54	
    55	"That's a clear alternative to annual contracts for unlimited support that
    56	may cost $15,000, and high, fixed fees for service that may or may not be
    57	needed," said Mendell.
    58	
    59	"The 900 Support hot lines also eliminate the all-too-typical long waits on
    60	hold or waits for a technician to call back -- if the technician calls
    61	back. Instead, 900 Support provides callers with immediate access to
    62	expert help, which is critical when the network is down, employees aren't
    63	working and the company is losing sales and money."
    64	
    65	The pioneer service, 1-900-PRO-HELP, bills calls directly to the caller's
    66	telephone number. 1-800-YES-4TEC and 503-NET-HELP bill calls to a
    67	corporate account or credit card.
    68	
    69	After operating 1-900-PRO-HELP for almost a year and a half, 900 Support
    70	opened toll-free 1-800-YES-4TEC in April 1991 for corporations and
    71	government agencies that block access to 900-number-based telephone
    72	services.
    73	
    74	900 Support opened 503-NET-HELP in August 1991 for international network
    75	users, administrators and engineers unable to dial the 800-and-900
    76	number-based services from outside the United States.
    77	
    78	Overall, the volume of calls to all three hot lines is up 200 percent from
    79	the prior year. 1-900-PRO-HELP posted the biggest year-to-year gain, with
    80	1991 calls up 300 percent over 1990 volume. Calls to the newer hot lines,
    81	1-800-YES4TEC and 503-NET-HELP are up 60 percent.
    82	
    83	The big gain in 1-900-PRO-HELP calls reflects convenience, said Mendell.
    84	
    85	"Customers gain immediate access to the expert services they need, and the
    86	call is charged to the caller's telephone bill. That's simple and easy.
    87	The 1-800YES-4TEC and 503-NET-HELP hot lines provide an alternative
    88	convenience, where calls are charged to a corporate account or a credit
    89	card."
    90	
    91	Two categories comprise an almost equal 50 percent share of the calling
    92	volume -- first, end users and LAN administrators, and, second,
    93	value-added resellers and systems integrators that market, install,
    94	configure and maintain networks.
    95	
    96	The hot lines also receive calls from management information systems
    97	executives confirming system specs and proposals from consultants hired to
    98	build or expand a network.
    99	
   100	A typical call now takes 12 minutes, up from 10 minutes during the first
   101	year, reflecting the shift to more complex networks, said Mendell.
   102	
   103	Calls during the day continue to be simpler, relating to operation and
   104	maintenance of the network. Evening, night and weekend calls focus on
   105	upgrades, troubleshooting and new installations, an indication that
   106	callers do not tackle the most difficult problems during standard business
   107	hours.
   108	
   109	However, the mix of off-hours calls now includes more operation and
   110	maintenance questions as international callers make use of 603-NET-HELP.
   111	
   112	More than 95 percent of all problems are solved in one call. A problem that
   113	is not resolved typically requires the caller to perform a lengthy
   114	operation off line.
   115	
   116	"A caller may need help with a disk upgrade, for example," said Mendell.
   117	"In the course of investigating you discover they have not yet done a
   118	backup, so you instruct them to perform the backup off line, then do steps
   119	x, y and z, and to call back if they encounter any problems. You certainly
   120	don't want to keep the customer on line while waiting for the backup to
   121	complete."
   122	
   123	Printing and upgrades to NetWare 386 from NetWare 286 generate a lot of
   124	calls. Questions about NetWare Lite, introduced in late 1991, are
   125	increasing, and represent about 15 percent of the calling volume.
   126	
   127	Network printing is one of three surprises noted by 900 Support during the
   128	first two years of operation, according to Mendell.
   129	
   130	Network printing capabilities have increased. So have printing complexities
   131	-- "which is generating more calls for support than before Novell made
   132	network printing facilities more powerful," said Mendell.
   133	
   134	"For example, what was a stand-alone printer is now shared. That introduces
   135	complexity. The applications may not be aware they are running on a
   136	network. More complexity. The shared printer at the file server is now
   137	located at the file server or the workstation. Still more complexity. And
   138	NetWare must properly trap all the formatting and fonts at the
   139	workstation, for example, for transfer into the printing queue. "
   140	
   141	The second surprise is the number of large businesses and government
   142	agencies using the hot lines.
   143	
   144	"We targeted smaller and medium-sized businesses that couldn't afford an
   145	annual service contract," said Mendell. "Yet even the companies that can
   146	afford contracts are calling, which says they are not satisfied with the
   147	technical-support they are otherwise getting"
   148	
   149	The third surprise is the poor market share of Microsoft's LAN Manager.
   150	
   151	"Trade journals report Microsoft's LAN market share at less than two
   152	percent. Calls to the hot line confirm that. This may change as Microsoft
   153	moves to a new release that is reported to be competitive."
   154	
   155	Oregon-based 900 Support Inc. is today's pioneer in cost-effective,
   156	responsive, 24-hour customer support for users of personal computers and
   157	personal-computer networks.--
