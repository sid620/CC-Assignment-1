     1	P6 Processor Overview
     2	
     3	Intel's P6 family of processors...
     4	
     5	  o Ensures complete binary compatibility with previous generations of the 
     6	    Intel Architecture.
     7	
     8	  o Delivers superior performance through an innovation called Dynamic 
     9	    Execution*.
    10	
    11	  o Provides support for enhanced data integrity and reliability feaures: 
    12	    ECC (Error Checking and Correction), Fault Analysis & Recovery, and 
    13	    Functional Redundancy Checking.
    14	
    15	  o Includes features that will greatly simplify the design of multiprocessing 
    16	    systems.
    17	
    18	The first member of the P6 processor family... 
    19	
    20	  o Arrives in desktops and servers in 1995.
    21	
    22	  o Integrates about 5.5 million transistors on the chip, compared to 
    23	    approximately 3.1 million transistors on the Pentium processor.
    24	
    25	  o Will operate at 133 MHz with estimated performance at more than 200 
    26	    SPECint92.
    27	
    28	  o Will initially be produced on the same high volume 0.6 micron process 
    29	    currently used for the 90 and 100 MHz versions of the Pentium processor, 
    30	    and will then move to a 0.35 micron process.
    31	  
    32	  o Delivers performance that will scale up to 1000 MIPS with four processors.
    33	
    34	
    35	* What is Dynamic Execution?
    36	
    37	  Dynamic Execution is the unique combination of three processing 
    38	  techniques the P6 uses to speed up software:
    39	
    40	o Multiple Branch prediction:  
    41	  First, the processor looks multiple steps ahead in the software and 
    42	  predicts which branches, or groups of instructions, are likely to be 
    43	  processed next.  This increases the amount of work fed to the processor.
    44	 
    45	o Dataflow analysis: 
    46	  Next, the P6 analyzes which instructions are dependent on each other's 
    47	  results, or data, to create an optimized schedule of instructions.
    48	 
    49	o Speculative Execution: 
    50	  Instructions are then carried out speculatively based on this optimized 
    51	  schedule, keeping all the chip's superscalar processing power busy, and 
    52	  boosting overall software performance.
