     4	             The following is the personal account of one of the 
     5	        aggrieved parties, David Garner of Cascade Electronics.

     7	        =================================================================
     8	
     9	             I personally met John in August or September of 1987 at a 
    10	        meeting of Minneapolis computer users that meets Saturdays for 
    11	        lunch. We did some trading of computer hardware with no cash 
    12	        involved (trading for equal value) until the end of December 
    13	        1987. At that time John stated that he could get 200 floppy disk 
    14	        drives for $14.00 each. These were used drives that might need 
    15	        repair. I paid for these drives in December of 1987.
    16	
    17	             The drives did not arrive and in March of 1988 a refund was 
    18	        given to me in the form of a credit. From January to the present 
    19	        John has purchased $9640.00 in merchandise from me. I gave P.C. 
    20	        Information Exchange checks for a total of $16,684.40 from 
    21	        January of 1988 to the present.
    22	
    23	             During the first part of April 1988 John stated that he had 
    24	        a request for a quote from the Minneapolis Public Library for 20 
    25	        AT computers. He said that he had all his money tied up in memory 
    26	        chip purchases and that he wanted to purchase the hardware from 
    27	        me (Cascade Electronics) and pay me when he got paid by the 
    28	        library (NET 30 terms). I supplied the hardware to him between 
    29	        the 18 of April and the 25 of April as I received the hardware 
    30	        from my suppliers. As part of the bid from the library John said 
    31	        that all systems must be installed by May 1 1988. Total value of 
    32	        the hardware for the 20 systems was $48,700.00
    33	
    34	             In this same time frame John asked if I would want to buy 
    35	        some 41256-12 memory chips. I agreed to purchase 3000 chips at 
    36	        $6.50 each.  Delivery was to be made by May. 2 at the latest. 
    37	        Payment was made for the memory in the form of cash and hardware 
    38	        for a total of $19,500.00
    39	
    40	             John was at the users group meeting on April 30. He said the 
    41	        chips would arrive Monday by Emery. He also said that all 20 
    42	        systems were delivered and installed at the library. He also took 
    43	        delivery of two XT cases and 2 XT Power Supplies. No payment was 
    44	        made. Total value was $170.00
    45	
    46	             On Sunday John called Don Seiford and said that he had an 
    47	        offer for his house in Boston and had to fly there Sunday but 
    48	        would return on monday morning.
    49	
    50	             PC Information Exchange was a local and national hub for the 
    51	        FIDONET <TM> network. The system went down sometime that Sunday.  
    52	        All 8 lines were busy.
    53	
    54	             PC Information Exchange was a subscription service supplied 
    55	        by John. People were asked to pay $20.00 for the use of his 
    56	        bulletin board. John asked for payment by mailing out statements 
    57	        to the people that used the PC Information system.

    61	
    62	             By May 4 myself, Don Seiford, and Steve Sherwick were 
    63	        starting to worry about John. He never let his system go down and 
    64	        he had not talked to anyone that we know of. On May 5 Don Seiford 
    65	        talked to some people at John's condo unit and they said that 
    66	        they last saw John putting his computer hardware into his truck 
    67	        on Sunday (May 1)
    68	
    69	             On May 5 and 6 The following was determined :
    70	
    71	             HONEYWELL (Where John claimed to work) had no record of him. 
    72	        This was confirmed with personnel and security.
    73	
    74	             The local Airforce base had no record of him. Also no F-14's 
    75	        (which he claimed to fly) are stationed here.
    76	
    77	             The Minneapolis Public Library was contacted and reported,      
    78	        the library system is in the process of purchasing the hardware 
    79	        that was sold to John.  PC Information Exchange was asked to 
    80	        quote on the hardware but had not responded. The P.O. for the 
    81	        library system hardware had not been issued as of May 6,1988.
    82	
    83	             On checking John's Condo no one had seen John since Sunday      
    84	        April 30 1988.
    85	
    86	             John also sold 15,000 memory chips to another Minneapolis 
    87	        distributor. They paid 15% down on the order with delivery 
    88	        promised by May 2, 1988.  No delivery was made. John also 
    89	        purchased about $5,000.00 of hardware from the same company on 
    90	        Friday April 29 1988. The check was returned marked insufficient 
    91	        funds. Total loss to that company is about $20,000. A report has 
    92	        been made to the Eden Prairie, MN. Police Dept.  (Case #88005145)
    93	
    94	             It was also noted that John applied a trailer hitch to his 
    95	        truck April 23. Later investigation confirmed he had acquired a 
    96	        trailer to carry considerable goods.
