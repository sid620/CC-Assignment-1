   460	                              How to read this catalog
   461	
   462	          ASP members have supplied product descriptions for each shareware
   463	          application they offer.  The catalog groups them by subject
   464	          matter and lists them alphabetically.  If you want to know the
   465	          name/address/phone for the author of a particular program, turn
   466	          to the index and look for the program by name.  You'll usually
   467	          see two page references: one describes the page where you read
   468	          about the program, the other mentions the page where you can find
   469	          information about the author (in Appendix A).  Just turn to the
   470	          appropriate page and scan for the name of the program.
   471	
   472	          The Association of Shareware Professionals does NOT rate members'
   473	          software for functionality or usefulness, nor can it attest to
   474	          the validity of any product description in this catalog.  That is
   475	          for you -- the user -- to decide.  Shareware, especially those
   476	          products authorized to carry the ASP logo, can be tested on a
   477	          "try before you buy" basis.  If the software doesn't meet your
   478	          needs, you won't have to worry about getting a refund.  (That's
   479	          the beauty of the shareware marketing concept.)
   480	
   481	
   482	          1.1  Minimum requirements
   483	
   484	          Every program description lists its computer and operating system
   485	          requirements (e.g. "IBM PC, DOS 2.0 or better").  Unless noted
   486	          otherwise, each program assumes you have a standard keyboard,
   487	          monitor, printer, and either two floppy drives or a hard disk.
   488	          And unless noted otherwise, programs written for the IBM PC
   489	          assume you have at least 512k of total installed RAM.  Many pro-
   490	          grams may also need specific hardware or software such as:
   491	
   492	             CGA monitor A video monitor capable of displaying CGA
   493	                         graphics.  This includes most "laptop CGA" com-
   494	                         puters, plus higher resolution monitors such as
   495	                         the EGA or VGA.  Some of the described programs
   496	                         may operate correctly with a Hercules monitor if
   497	                         you use a "CGA simulator" program; consult your
   498	                         video monitor manual for details.
   499	             Dual 720k drives
   500	                         At least two floppy drives capable of writing at
   501	                         least 720k of data per disk, or, preferably, a
   502	                         hard disk (see below).
   503	             EGA monitor A video monitor capable of displaying EGA
   504	                         graphics.  This almost always includes VGA and
   505	                         other higher-resolution monitors.  CGA and
   506	                         Hercules monitors won't suffice.
   507	             Hard disk   A fixed-, removeable-, or network-drive device
   508	                         capable of storing multiple megabytes of data.
   509	                         Some programs also assume you have at least one
   510	                         floppy drive in addition to the hard disk.

   516	             Hercules monitor
   517	                         A video monitor capable of displaying Hercules
   518	                         graphics.  CGA monitors won't suffice.
   519	             HP DeskJet  A Hewlett-Packard DeskJet or compatible printer.
   520	                         Some programs may require a DeskJet starting with
   521	                         a specific model such as the DeskJet Plus or
   522	                         having a specific feature like a RAM cartridge.
   523	             HP LaserJet A Hewlett-Packard LaserJet or compatible printer.
   524	                         (HP DeskJet printers recognize most, but not all,
   525	                         of the HP LaserJet command set.)  Some programs
   526	                         may require a LaserJet either starting with a
   527	                         specific model such as the LaserJet II or having a
   528	                         specific feature like the LaserJet IIIDSi.
   529	             Modem       A modem.  Almost all programs work with a "Hayes"
   530	                         modem, specifically one able to recognize the
   531	                         Hayes command set (an industry standard).  A few
   532	                         programs claim to work with non-Hayes modems too.
   533	                         Some programs may require the modem to operate at
   534	                         a specific rate of speed (e.g. "1200 baud").
   535	             Mouse       A mouse.
   536	             Network     A computer hooked up a local area network (LAN)
   537	                         system.  Program descriptions will normally
   538	                         specify the different types of LAN systems under
   539	                         which they can operate.
   540	             Plotter     A plotter output device.  Many of the described
   541	                         programs need a plotter able to recognize the HPGL

   563	          registration (you don't just get a canceled check) and must
   564	          provide a minimum amount of technical support for at least three
   565	          months.

   571	          Many authors provide other registration benefits such as a
   572	          printed manual, a master disk, a year of unlimited phone support,
   573	          source code, etc.  The product description will mention them when

   576	          In addition, every ASP member can offer the following benefits to

   589	
   590	          Some authors add "registration reminder screens" to the shareware
   591	          version of a program as a way to gently remind people to
   592	          register.  (The ASP sets ethical standards regarding it.)  Almost
   593	          all authors will either send a copy of the program without
   594	          reminder screens, or will disclose a method to disable the
   595	          reminders, once you register the product.

   642	            rare cases, U.S. federal laws may actually prohibit the author

  1672	            program.  Includes a quick option to wipe a disk clean without
  1673	            checking for bad spots.

 20886	            There's trouble in the garden!  You are in the midst of a
 20887	            gopher invasion and they're tearing up the place.  You must
 20888	            find the pesky critters and get rid of them before they eat all
 20889	            of your flowers.  It isn't easy because you can't actually see
 20890	            them.  All you see is the flowers disappearing and an
 20891	            occasional mound of dirt.  While trying to catch them be
 20892	            careful to avoid crushing your own flowers.  Mouse support is
 20893	            provided as an automatic option.

 20908	            A build-it game.  You must collect all of the robot part boxes
 20909	            in the 10-story building and take them to the laboratory for
 20910	            assembly.  Watch your battery supply.  If you don't have enough
 20911	            power to run the elevator and lifts, you can get stranded.  The
 20912	            elevator and lifts sometimes need repairing so they work

 20944	            gain sufficient energy to change shape and destroy green
 20945	            gremlins for a while.  You lose strength for each step you

 21004	            In this colorful maze game, you are a ghost who can walk
 21005	            through walls matching the colors of the magic keys you can
 21006	            collect.  At first, all of the walls are solid.  Pressing the
 21007	            "SPIN" key makes the corners of the walls spin at random, to
 21008	            open different doorways.  Each spin costs one of the gems you
 21009	            must collect.  Bumping solid walls or knocking over paint cans
 21010	            costs extra points.  The object is to maneuver through the
 21011	            maze, collect keys and gems, and get to the winners circle in
 21012	            the fewest steps.

 21073	            How tornadoes pick up and drop things inspired Vortex.  The
 21074	            idea is to trap as many of the tornadoes as possible.  Each
 21075	            tornado picks up and drops blocks at random and can set others
 21076	            free. They can only carry one at a time but you can pick up
 21077	            three. The color density of the cursor increases each time you
 21078	            pick up a block.  If you have one or more blocks and are not
 21079	            moving you are safe.  Otherwise, if a tornado catches you, it
 21080	            will pick YOU up and the game ends.

 22259	            A deceptively simple solitaire game requiring both strategy and
 22260	            cunning.  You claim nodes on a web while trying to limit the
 22261	            moves available to your opponent. Automatic display of

 22416	            No one really knows when PEG solitaire was invented. Some
 22417	            stories trace it to prisoners during the French Revolution, but
 22418	            published descriptions date at least 100 years earlier.  Most
 22419	            likely the game is even older.  PEG presents variations on the
 22420	            classic peg solitaire with multiple starting positions, and
 22421	            varying endgames.  One of the pleasures of playing the game on
 22422	            your computer is that you can quickly set up the board to try
 22423	            different strategies. Ages 8 to 88.

 22443	                                   About shareware
 22444	
 22445	
 22446	          18.1  Assn. Shareware Professionals
 22447	
 22448	            The Association of Shareware Professionals (ASP) formed in 1987
 22449	            to strengthen the future of shareware as an alternative to
 22450	            traditional (retail) software marketing.  It also serves as an
 22451	            information clearing house for its members and the public at
 22452	            large.  ASP members subscribe to a code of ethics and are
 22453	            committed to the shareware concept.
 22454	
 22455	            The ASP demands professionalism from its members.  Authors must
 22456	            acknowledge every registration (you get more than just a
 22457	            canceled check) and they must provide at least three months of
 22458	            support for their products.  ASP members must also live up to
 22459	            any other benefits they offer.
 22460	
 22461	            You can turn to an ombudsman for help if you can't resolve a
 22462	            problem with an ASP author or disk vendor.  Members must
 22463	            explain this in every shareware program & disk vendor catalog.
 22464	
 22465	            Few people need the ombudsman's help.  ASP members represent
 22466	            the cream of the crop in the shareware industry, but it's nice
 22467	            to know you can turn to someone if you think you got a raw
 22468	            deal.  Unfortunately, it happens -- authors have been kicked
 22469	            out because of repeated complaints.
 22470	
 22471	            The Association monitors Congress for potentially damaging
 22472	            legislation and has sent spokesmen to testify before
 22473	            congressional subcommittees.  It has also taken on the respon-
 22474	            sibility of safeguarding the term 'shareware' itself.  ASP has
 22475	            filed motions in countries as far away as England and South
 22476	            Africa to stop people who attempt to claim it as a trademark
 22477	            word.
 22478	
 22479	            ASP members 'meet' online in a public forum of the CompuServe
 22480	            network (GO SHAREWARE).  Members send & receive messages,
 22481	            transmit files, and exchange valuable information.  Old hands
 22482	            in the shareware business pass along their insights to new
 22483	            members.  The group holds public and private debates and
 22484	            members vote on major issues by sending private messages to the
 22485	            Association secretary.
 22486	
 22487	            The ASP holds yearly 'face to face' meetings and appears at
 22488	            various trade shows around the country (including COMDEX and
 22489	            PC-EXPO).  It also provides speakers who lecture on every
 22490	            aspect of shareware.  You can learn more by writing to the
 22491	            Association of Shareware Professionals, 545 Grover Road,

 26868	
 26869	            This appendix lists shareware products now "retired" by the
 26870	            author.  Retired products no longer receive the minimum levels
 26871	            of support, and the authors have agreed to return any registra-
 26872	            tion fees sent in for the software.
 26873	
 26874	            An author may retire a shareware product for any number of
 26875	            reasons.  Some applications have outlived their usefulness;
 26876	            others may have grown too costly to continue supporting due to
 26877	            competition from other authors.

 26912	
 26913	            This appendix notes the author of each program listed in this
 26914	            catalog.  It comes in extremely handy when you want to see if a
 26915	            given program comes from an ASP member, or when you want to
 26916	            know the current version number/release date for a program.
 26917	            Hint: look in the index for the program (by name) if you want
 26918	            to see a full description for the program or learn the author's
 26919	            address & phone number.  You'll find page references to all the
 26920	            information you need.
