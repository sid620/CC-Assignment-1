     5	Gary Kildall died in July 1994 at the age of 52. The computer media, with a
     6	few small exceptions, ignored his passing. The Circumstances of his death
     7	are pretty murky. One report attributed it to a fall from a ladder, another
     8	an incident at a bar, and another to a heart attack.
     9	
    10	Every PC owner owes Gary a debt of gratitude. Bill Gates and Microsoft owe
    11	him more than anyone else. Gary was the first person to interface a disk
    12	system to a microcomputer and create an operating system for it. He changed
    13	what had previously been a circuit designed for process control applications
    14	into a fully functional computer. Microcomputers now did tasks previously
    15	done only on minicomputers and mainframes. The world changed dramatically
    16	because of his work.
    17	
    18	Gary received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Washington
    19	in 1972 and joined the Navy. It is interesting to note that both Gary and
    20	Bill Gates were born and raised in the Seattle area. Like Gates, Gary also
    21	had a passion for computers. However, unlike Gates he completed his college
    22	education. Their paths crossed early on when Gates, a high school student,
    23	and Gary, a college student, both worked on the same DEC PDP-10 computer
    24	system.
    25	
    26	The Navy appointed Gary to be a Computer Science instructor at their
    27	Post-Graduate School in Monterey, California. At the school, Gary purchased
    28	an Intel 4004 microprocessor chip set for himself and his students to
    29	experiment with. The 4004 was Intel's first microprocessor and the first in
    30	the world. It was programmable, handled 4-bit words and contained all of
    31	2,250 transistors. Intel, at the time was primarily in the memory IC
    32	business, and created the 4004 as a custom project for one customer. When
    33	the customer wanted to renegotiate the price Intel asked that they give up
    34	their exclusive rights to the device. Intel introduced it in November 1971.
    35	Much to Intel's surprise the device was an instant success. Engineers began
    36	designing it into a wide variety of applications such as scales, traffic
    37	light controls, musical instruments, washing machines, printers, and more
    38	Intel soon realized that 4004 system designers needed software development
    39	support. Gary was hired as a consultant to create a programming language for
    40	the device. Gary created PL/M (Programming Language/Microprocessor) to run
    41	on an IBM 360 computer and generate executable binary code that was then
    42	burned into the ROM memory of the 4004 system.
    43	
    44	Marcian "Ted" Hoff designer of the 4004, quickly followed with the 8008, the
    45	first 8-bit microprocessor. It was introduced in March 1972. Gary was again
    46	hired to develop PL/M for the device. Intel also designed an 8008-based
    47	small computer, called the Intellec-8. About the same size as the IBM PC, it
    48	was used for hardware and software development. Gary set one up in a
    49	classroom at school for his students. To make it easier to use, Gary
    50	developed a simulator/debugger program for the unit.
    51	
    52	Intel began to see that microprocessors helped sell more memory chips and
    53	developed a much more powerful 8-bit microprocessor, the 8080. Gary was
    54	again hired to create the development software. He was given an Intellec-80
    55	to use at school.
    56	
    57	In 1973 Shugart gave Intel a sample 8" floppy disk. Gary was immediately
    58	intrigued by the device and with a friend, John Torode, built a controller
    59	interface to an Intellec-80. Gary, and his students, wrote a small control
    60	program which he called CP/M (Control Program/Microcomputer). It enabled him
    61	to read and write files to and from the disk. Gary copied the commands and
    62	file-naming conventions from the DEC PDP-10 VMS operating system. Gordon
    63	Eubanks, one of Gary's students, created a BASIC interpreter for the system.
    64	Early versions of CP/M and the BASIC interpreter were in the public domain
    65	since it had been created at a publicly funded institution. Copies found
    66	their way to some other government contractors and agencies.
    67	
    68	In 1976, after his discharge from the Navy, Gary became a full- time
    69	consultant, using the name Intergalatic Digital Research. Together with
    70	Torode he designed floppy disk systems for several microcomputer
    71	manufacturers. At the time, MITS and IMSAI, the two leading 8080
    72	microcomputer system kit makers, announced floppy disk systems. MITS offered
    73	a version of BASIC (written by Bill Gates and Paul Allen) that could load
    74	and save BASIC programs on disk. MITS contracted with another software
    75	developer for a Disk Operating System. When shipped in early 1977, it proved
    76	unreliable and had poor performance. MITS also refused to license the DOS to
    77	other system makers.
    78	
    79	IMSAI, needing to compete with MITS, approached Gary for a non-exclusive
    80	CP/M license for a fixed $25,000 fee. Since several other manufactuters also
    81	wanted CP/M, Gary rewrote it completely to make it easier to install on
    82	different hardware systems. He made it hardware-independent by creating a
    83	separate module which he called the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System). He
    84	also added an editor, assembler, debugger, and several utilities. CP/M
    85	became a full-blown computer development system Gary, and his former wife,
    86	Dorothy McEwen, formed Digital Research Inc. to market CP/M-80. They placed
    87	a small classified ad in Dr. Dobb's Journal and were suprised by the large
    88	number of orders from hobbyists for the $90 software package. By early 1977,
    89	several manufacturers were including CP/M with their systems. They provided
    90	a ROM-BIOS so that CP/M loaded immediately on power-up.
    91	
    92	By 1978 Microsoft BASIC and FORTRAN, UCSD Pascal, MicroPro's WordStar,
    93	Ashton-Tate's dBase, and other programs were running on CP/M-based on
    94	machines from Apple, Radio Shack, Commodore, Zenith, Sharp, and almost a
    95	hundred other manufacturers. In 1980, IBM approached DRI, to license
    96	CP/M-86, an 8086 version of CP/M then being developed. Gary had been working
    97	on this but delayed finishing it while working on several language projects.
    98	Intel had introduced the 8086 16-bit microprocessor in June 1978 and
    99	followed it a year later with the 8088, a lower-cost and slower version. IBM
   100	decided to use the 8088 for its new PC.
   101	
   102	Seattle Computer Products in early 1979 introduced the first 8086 computer
   103	kit. Sales languished while SCP waited for DRI to introduce CP/M-86. In
   104	desperation SCP hired Tim Paterson to develop a DOS for them. Tim quickly
   105	created a simplified 8086 version of CP/M which he called QDOS (Quick and
   106	Dirty Operating System, since it did not implement all of CP/M's features).
   107	Microsoft, located nearby, modified BASIC for the system.
   108	
   109	IBM met with a cool reception when they approached DRI for a CP/M license.
   110	Dorothy McEwen and DRI's attorney refused to sign the IBM non-disclosure
   111	agreement (Gary did not attend the meeting), refused to make any
   112	modifications to CP/M-86 and insisted on a higher royalty than what IBM
   113	proposed. Bill Gates, who had been negotiating a BASIC license with IBM,
   114	seized the opportunity and offered to provide a DOS/BASIC package to IBM on
   115	favorable terms. Gates licensed SCP-DOS (for $50,000) and hired Tim Paterson
   116	to modify it to run on the IBM-PC. Microsoft submitted a copy to IBM for
   117	testing, who found over 300 bugs. IBM cleaned up many of the bugs, made a
   118	number a number of improvements and wrote the user manual.
   119	
   120	DRI released CP/M-86 soon after IBM released DOS Version 1.0. DOS had fewer
   121	features and poorer performance. IBM offered both CP/M-86 and DOS. CP/M-86
   122	was offered at $240 versus $60 for DOS. Few PC owners were willing to pay
   123	the extra money DRI considered suing Microsoft for copying all the CP/M
   124	system calls, program structure, and user interface. However, DRI knew it
   125	would also have to sue IBM. It knew it did not have the resources for this
   126	and that its chances of success were remote. In 1982, IBM asked Microsoft to
   127	develop a hard disk version of DOS. Microsoft used the opportunity to
   128	completely rewrite DOS so that version 2.0 was very different from version
   129	1.0 and DRI's opportunity to sue was gone. DRI continued to improve CP/M-86
   130	introducing multi-tasking and muti-user versions. However, they were not
   131	completely compatible with DOS and largely ignored by the marketplace. In
   132	1989 DRI introduced a DOS compatible version (DR-DOS) which was recognized
   133	as superior to DOS. However, Microsoft marketing tactics (disclosed in the
   134	Justice Department investigation) shut DRI out of the market. Microsoft
   135	responded with versions 5.0 and 6.0 incorporating many of DR-DOS's features.
   136	
   137	Kildall also pioneered in the development of a GUI (Grapical User Interface)
   138	for the PC. Called GEM (Graphical Environment Manager), it was demoed at the
   139	November 1983 COMDEX and shipped in the spring of 1984. GEM presented the
   140	user with a screen virtually identical to that of the Macintosh. Apple
   141	threatened to sue DRI. DRI responded by making some cosmetic changes to GEM.
   142	DRI did not recognize the potential of a GUI interface and did not put any
   143	marketing effort behind it. DRI eventually withdrew GEM from the retail
   144	market. It continued to market GEM to software developers as a front end for
   145	their graphics products. The most well-known product to use the GEM GUI was
   146	"Ventura Publisher" from XEROX.
   147	
   148	Microsoft finally demonstrated their Windows GUI at the Spring 1985 Comdex,
   149	shipping version 1.0 in the fall. Microsoft learned from DRI's experience
   150	with Apple and made Windows appear slightly different from the Mac GUI.
   151	Version 1.0 proved an embarrassment to Microsoft. It was incredibly slow,
   152	unreliable, and lacked the smooth performance of GEM and the Mac. Version
   153	2.0 of Windows did likewise. Windows was completely rewritten for version
   154	3.0 and released in the spring of 1990, with the most expensive software
   155	promotional campaign the industry had ever seen coupled with aggressive
   156	marketing (initial price was $39 and thousands of copies were given away
   157	free). Gates did what neither IBM, DRI, Apple, Xerox, or the other GUI
   158	developers were willing to do. Namely, to make a total commitment, risking
   159	the entire company on the success of a GUI.
   160	
   161	Microsoft sought to gain the largest market share by distributing Windows
   162	primarily through OEM channels. System manufacturers were persuaded to offer
   163	DOS and Windows preloaded onto hard disks by offering a low OEM price of $35
   164	on average while offering Windows to retailers at $75. Microsoft actually
   165	made more money on the OEM version because the manufacturer assumed the cost
   166	of printing manuals, providing disk backups, the packaging, and support.
   167	Version 3.0 also proved unreliable. Microsoft fixed the bugs, added a few
   168	minor features and introduced it as version 3.1. Gates turned a major
   169	problem into a marketing success. 3.0 owners paying a second time, in effect
   170	paid for the repair of design defects.
   171	
   172	Gary was also the first person to work on the development of software for
   173	driving CD-ROM interfaces. We will probably never know all of the system
   174	software work that he has created.
   175	
   176	There is no doubt that Gary Kildall led the way in microcomputer software
   177	development. I wonder what Microsoft will do now that they no longer have
   178	Gary Kildall to lead the way for them?
   179	
   180	Many ACGNJers met and spent time with Gary at the 1979 Trenton Computer
   181	Festival. I met with him many times, as a magazine author and editor, and
   182	President of ACGNJ. I developed great admiration for his talents, his
   183	hardwork, and willingness to help others. I will also miss him as a friend.
