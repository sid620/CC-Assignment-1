     1	BOSTON, MA, February 11,1992 -- Emerson Computer Power has unveiled a new
     2	full featured, on-line uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for use with
     3	single file server LANs such as those based on 386 or 486 PCs. It is being
     4	demonstrated at the Emerson booth (#1511) here at NetWorld.
     5	
     6	"Rated at 750 VA, the AccuPower GOLD AU750 offers all the features of our
     7	popular AU1000 and AU1500 in a size that's right for small file servers
     8	that need continuous access to clean sinewave power protection," according
     9	to Steve Workman, product manager. Priced at $1249, the AU760 is a
    10	cost-effective choice for those users. It is immediately available.
    11	
    12	The new AU750 can be used in either local or remote applications. If the
    13	UPS is not adjacent to the system operators, status reports are available
    14	on their monitors via the AU750's RS-232 serial communication port and
    15	Emerson's new AccuMon Power Surveillance Software. This feature allows the
    16	workstation operator to read input and output voltage, temperature,
    17	battery load, battery capacity, etc, on a highly graphic screen, and it
    18	permits data logging. It also reports when power has failed and the system
    19	is running on battery.
    20	
    21	The UPS is also equipped with audible and visual indicators to keep the
    22	local operator constantly informed about the unit's status. For example,
    23	one LED bar display reports percentage load and a second indicates
    24	remaining battery capacity. A light on the front panel and an audible
    25	alarm warn when the unit is operating on battery or when a fault condition
    26	is present. A battery test can be conducted in place or remotely.
    27	
    28	The AccuPower GOLD AU750 is designed with state of the art components that
    29	improve efficiency and reliability while making the unit smaller, lighter,
    30	quieter and more convenient than earlier on-line units. It includes a
    31	power factor correction circuit to minimize the amount of noise the UPS
    32	reflects back into the utility line and to let the UPS use utility power
    33	more efficiently.
    34	
    35	The 750 VA unit will support two IBM PS/2 Model 80s for more than 10
    36	minutes. To minimize noise, its dual speed fan operates on low (less than
    37	40 db) unless the UPS is fully loaded.
    38	
    39	The AccuPower GOLD AU750 weighs only 36 pounds and is a compact 9-5/8 x 7 x
    40	20-1/4 inches, giving it one of the smallest footprints in the industry.
    41	It is equipped with four NEMA outlets on the rear for plugging in
    42	computer, monitor and peripherals.
    43	
    44	Emerson Computer Power is the world's largest manufacturer of power
    45	protection systems for computing applications ranging from single user PCs
    46	and local area networks to minicomputers and mainframe systems. The
    47	company has major manufacturing centers in Ohio, California, Mexico,
    48	England, Malaysia and Italy.
