    10	Speaking of passwords, I think it's probably a good idea that someone
    11	should advise our new (and not so new) users on the art of picking
    12	passwords. Anybody volunteer? Speak now or forever hold your peace? No?
    13	Ok, I'll take it on myself to do this.
    14	 
    15	Your password is the only thing that stands between you and some nasty
    16	haker-type person. Your username is common knowledge to everybody that
    17	uses the system, so you must keep your password secret. This means not
    18	telling people, or lending it to people, or writing it down and sticking
    19	it to your screen, or anything like that.
    20	 
    21	It also means that you must choose your password carefully. Recent
    22	experiements have shown that 25% of people choose passwords that can
    23	easily be hacked. The method that is most often used to hack a password is
    24	called the 'dictionary hack'. The hacker gets a dictionary and goes
    25	through it trying each word as the password. Of course he doesn't do this
    26	by hand, he writes a little prog to do it, and the dictionary is a file of
    27	words. So, if you use a word that is found in the dictionary, you'll be
    28	found out. Just stop for a second and think if any of your passwords are
    29	words that are found in the dictionary?
    30	 
    31	So, how do you combat this? Simple, don't choose words from the
    32	dictionary!  But at the same time it's not a good idea to use dates,
    33	number plates, phone numbers, etc. The best ways are to make us words.
    34	Simply string two or more words together to form a new word. For example,
    35	BLADE and RUNNER may be in the dictionary, but I'll bet that BLADERUNNER
    36	or BLADE-RUNNER or BLADE.RUNNER isn't!  You can also use the initial
    37	letters from words of a phrase. For example, Three Blind Mice Ran Up The
    38	Clock would translate to a password of TBMRUTC. Looks like a nonsense
    39	word, doesn't it? But it means something to you, you just have to remember
    40	the phrase.
    41	 
    42	Also, remember not to use the same password on different systems. I know
    43	that this is a hard thing not to do, but try to have different passwords
    44	on each board you use. And change the passwords regularly. Where I work
    45	all the passwords expire after 30 days, and you're forced to enter a new
    46	one. Some systems, like IBM systems, remember the last 5 or so passwords
    47	that you've used, and won't let you re-use them. They also force you to
    48	have at least one digit in the password and other things as well.
    49	 
    50	Oh, and one last thing. There are a whole lot of commonly used passwords.
    51	These passwords are used so often by people, that the hacker will always
    52	try these first.
    53	 
    54	Heres a list that I grabbed of Usenet that someone posted of the most
    55	commonly used passwords:

   157	     The Internet Worm used a lot of the above passwords in it's first
   158	password pass.  After that it just used the dictionary, etc.
   159	 
   160	     It'd really be worth it to check this list when people change

   189	I person would be crazy to admit there password is on that list,
   190	because you will be able to crack that persons account in less then two
   191	minutes using telnet.
   192	 
   193	Note that list is used my everyone, it is effective on non-educated
   194	users but since every password checker written in the last five years
   195	has this list (or the list the internet worm was built from) it is not
   196	as useful as it once was for password cracking. I suggest aquiring a
   197	list of female names, I have had the most sucess with those lists.
   198	 
   199	My 8mm tape collection used a list of common last names, female names,
   200	male names, the worm list, /usr/dict/words (from SunOS 4.1) and the
   201	word list from Webster's 7th Collegiate Dictionary, plus a list I put
   202	together (contains default password some OS's come with).
