    24	          SHAREWARE, PUBLIC DOMAIN, FREEWARE AND COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE
    25	                     
    26	       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
    27	
    28	       SHAREWARE is software which has been prepared by a variety of
    29	       individuals and companies. The concept governing shareware is 
    30	       that you "try before you buy." Shareware is above all a unique
    31	       marketing experiment which operates on the "honor system."
    32	       In practice, shareware is frequently of the same quality as 
    33	       commercial software. However, it uses a different, and somewhat 
    34	       less expensive method of marketing which involves letting 
    35	       others freely copy, use and distribute the shareware. What you 
    36	       receive from your friend at work, computer club, commercial 
    37	       shareware disk distributor or BBS modem system is a "disk 
    38	       evaluation copy" which you may use, copy and above all TRY. 
    39	       
    40	       Documentation and instructions for program use are usually 
    41	       contained within special text files on the same disk as the 
    42	       program and sometimes take a little detective work to locate.
    43	       Formal printed documentation and instruction books may also
    44	       be available from the author.
    45	       
    46	       If you like what you find and use the program consistently -
    47	       many shareware authors suggest 30 days, but this is not a 
    48	       firm rule - then you are expected to register the shareware 
    49	       by submitting a fee usually by mail to the author which 
    50	       frequently brings additional benefits sent back to you by 
    51	       the author of the shareware. Above all, it is legal to copy, 
    52	       distribute and USE shareware.
    53	
    54	       Computers improve the world, shareware improves computers 
    55	       and registration is what improves and motivates shareware 
    56	       programmers who are called "authors" in the trade. 
    57	       
    58	       If you do not submit a registration fee AT LEAST send a
    59	       postcard with your thoughts on why improvement is needed.
    60	       You just might NEED and USE the revised version which is
    61	       produced due to your funding or critique. Either way, feedback
    62	       is essential to the shareware process!
    63	       
    64	       The registration fee requested by the author is a matter of good 
    65	       conscience since shareware registration fees are paid by
    66	       users directly to the author "on the honor system." Paying 
    67	       an honest registration fee frequently means you will receive 
    68	       additional disks for the program or further instruction 
    69	       documents, bonus items or other "inducements" directly from the 
    70	       author. 
    71	       
    72	       Registration is more than this though: on a human scale your 
    73	       registration fee is supporting a small company or individual 
    74	       who shows you how to use and understand a computer. A programmer 
    75	       is a craftsman whose tools are logic and considerable creativity. 
    76	       Your registration check is a special bond which allows this 
    77	       quiet "honor system" of submitting your registration fee 
    78	       for a programming job well done to motivate creative programmers 
    79	       to produce some rather astonishing products! 
    80	       
    81	       The best way to summarize is this: you are not registering a 
    82	       product, you are helping a person or small company do something 
    83	       which improves how man uses the computer, most important tool of 
    84	       this century. Paying a registration fee to the author of the 
    85	       program rewards technical craftsmanship for providing creative 
    86	       computer solutions at unbelievably low cost. Good programmers are 
    87	       rare creatures - a small registration check goes a long way and 
    88	       means a lot to a small shareware author!               
    89	
    90	       PUBLIC DOMAIN software is a second type of computer software 
    91	       which is NOT copyrighted and has no other legal restrictions
    92	       as to use by the general public. The author may or may not
    93	       be identified. Most public domain programs result from the
    94	       efforts of a programmer who designs a small piece of software 
    95	       for personal use. The author may not decide to invest 
    96	       additional time in developing and marketing the software due to 
    97	       lack of market knowledge or lack time and funds to effectively 
    98	       develop it into a larger commercial or shareware package.
    99	       For these and other reasons, the author does not copyright the
   100	       software and allows it to be copied, used or even incorporated 
   101	       into other software packages since it is part of the public 
   102	       domain available for the common good.
   103	
   104	       FREEWARE is related to BUT NOT the same as public domain 
   105	       software. Freeware requires no registration fee or reimbursement 
   106	       for use by the public but the copyright is RETAINED BY THE 
   107	       AUTHOR who notes a copyright restriction within the body or
   108	       documentation of the software. A reason for this subtle
   109	       difference is that the author may, at a future date, wish to
   110	       reclaim all or part of the software or modify and reissue
   111	       the software as shareware or commercial software. The copyright 
   112	       continues the unique claim of the author to the product.
   113	
   114	       COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE is computer software provided by a company 
   115	       or individual which is generally marketed via retail, wholesale 
   116	       or other commercial means but does not use or promote a 
   117	       registration fee concept, a "try before you buy" concept, and
   118	       does not use or promote sharing copies of the program among 
   119	       individuals or other enterprises. The user is expected to purchase 
   120	       the right to use the package BEFORE being allowed to use the 
   121	       software extensively.
   122	
   123	       Note that either purchase or registration of any software 
   124	       package does not mean you own the package, merely THE RIGHT AND 
   125	       LICENSE TO USE IT. The author or company which produced it owns 
   126	       the software programming code and is granting you a LICENSE to use 
   127	       it in exchange for a fee or other compensation. In essence you 
   128	       do not buy or own software, you merely license its use. The 
   129	       author owns it.

   133	                      EIGHT EASY STEPS TO USING SHAREWARE
   134	
   135	       --------------------------------------------------------------- 
   136	       
   137	       Print this section and keep it next to your computer! These 
   138	       steps are the secrets to using shareware! We will look at each 
   139	       suggestion in greater detail in just a moment . . .
   140	       
   141	       1) Make a copy of the shareware disk, store your original
   142	          and work with the copy.
   143	       2) Do a DIRECTORY LISTING of the disk(s) on paper or your
   144	          monitor screen.
   145	       3) Determine FILE TYPES using extensions and filename clues.
   146	       4) Read DOCUMENTATION and TEXT FILES if available on disk.
   147	       5) Unpack and install the program.
   148	       6) Configure the program if necessary.
   149	       7) Run the program.
   150	       8) Submit a registration fee or at least postcard(s)
   151	          with your regrets to the author and the disk vendor.
   152

   154	       
   155	                   MINIMUM DOS COMMANDS FOR USING SHAREWARE
   156	       
   157	       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
   158	       
   159	       Before we move forward, a brief refresher course in several
   160	       basic DOS operations without which a shareware disk is useless.
   161	
   162	                                DOS SYNTAX
   163	
   164	       A DOS command must always use the same syntax illustrated
   165	       below:
   166	
   167	       COMMAND <blank space> WHAT? <space> WHERE? <press return/enter>
   168	
   169	       Example: COPY PCLEARN.TXT B:  <press return/enter key>
   170	       Example: TYPE PCLEARN.DOC     <press return/enter key>
   171	
   172	       In the second example DOS assume the WHERE is the screen.
   173	       In the first example DOS needs to be told that a copy
   174	       of a file is to be sent to the B: floppy drive.
   175	
   176	       NOTE! Generally DOS commands, drive letters and filenames
   177	       and be typed in upper or lower case or both, since DOS
   178	       is not fussy in that respect. It is ok to use capital letters, 
   179	       small letters or any combination.
   180	
   181	                                THE DIR COMMAND
   182	       
   183	       An essential command which displays the names of the files 
   184	       on a disk.
   185	
   186	       Example: A>DIR <press return/enter>   
   187	       
   188	       Lists files on the diskette your are in THE DEFAULT DRIVE, in 
   189	       this case is A:
   190	
   191	       Example: A>DIR B:
   192	
   193	       Lists files in the B: drive. We have omitted the <press enter/
   194	       return> since you already know this is necessary after a DOS
   195	       command.
   196	
   197	       Example: A>DIR /P
   198	
   199	       List files in current default drive but pause after each 
   200	       screenful of information.
   201	
   202	       Example: A>DIR B: /P
   203	
   204	       Same as above, but list the files on B: drive with a pause.
   205	
   206	       Example: A>DIR /W  
   207	
   208	       List current default drive but display in wide screen mode
   209	       for numerous files.
   210	
   211	       NOTE! With any DOS operation which rapidly fills and overflows
   212	       the screen with data, try pressing CTRL-S (control or ctrl key
   213	       plus the S key together at same time) to pause the screen.
   214	       Any key touched resumes the scrolling display and CTRL-S
   215	       repeated pauses again. Very handy!
   216	
   217	       NOTE! Switching drives is easy. If you see this:    A>
   218	       and you want to change the default drive to this:   B>
   219	       then simply do this:       A>B:   <press return/enter>
   220	       Switching default drives is an essential skill!
   221	
   222	                              THE FORMAT COMMAND
   223	
   224	       This prepares a blank disk to receive new information. You must
   225	       format disks out of the package from the store before you can 
   226	       use them. Formatting tests a disk and installs magnetic tracks
   227	       where information will later reside.
   228	
   229	       Examples:
   230	
   231	       C>FORMAT A:           format floppy in A:
   232	       A>FORMAT B:           format floppy in B:
   233	       C>FORMAT B:/S         see below for explanation . . .
   234	
   235	       The last example formats the disk in B: drive and also adds the
   236	       special system files so that the disk can be self starting
   237	       or self booting. Not essential with most disk you will work 
   238	       with. You MUST have the special file FORMAT.COM on your disk or 
   239	       hard drive to able to do this operation since FORMAT.COM normally
   240	       resides EXTERNALLY on a floppy or in a special area of your hard 
   241	       drive.
   242	
   243	                        THE COPY AND DISKCOPY COMMANDS
   244	
   245	       Moves, copies and even renames files as they pass from one
   246	       disk to another.
   247	
   248	       Examples:
   249	
   250	       A>COPY *.* B:    Copies ALL files (indicated by *.*) to the
   251	                        B: floppy drive.
   252	
   253	       A>DISKCOPY A: B: 
   254	
   255	       This is a variation of the copy command. The above example will
   256	       copy the ENTIRE contents of the diskette in the A: drive to the
   257	       B: drive. DISKCOPY.COM is an external file and must be available
   258	       to be used! The COPY command is an internal command (always 
   259	       resides in your computer's RAM memory and is thus ALWAYS 
   260	       AVAILABLE - unlike DISKCOPY.COM)
   261	       
   262	       A>DISKCOPY A: A:
   263	
   264	       This is a variation of the diskcopy command. The above example will
   265	       copy the ENTIRE contents of the diskette in the A: drive to the
   266	       A: drive for those using ONLY a single floppy drive system and
   267	       perhaps not having a B: or C: drive. In essence, this variation
   268	       copies the SOURCE diskette into memory, allows you to remove the
   269	       SOURCE diskette, insert a blank formatted TARGET diskette and 
   270	       transfer the files to that new floppy. Useful for those having only 
   271	       a single floppy drive.
   272	
   273	       C>COPY A:*.* B:
   274	
   275	       Copies all files from A: to B: while still in the C: default
   276	       directory.
   277	
   278	       C>COPY A:HAPPY.DOC B:
   279	
   280	       Copies only the file HAPPY.DOC to B:
   281	
   282	       NOTE! DISKCOPY is an external command and must be on the disk
   283	       or in the default directory to work. COPY is an internal command
   284	       and is always available at the DOS command line. We mentioned 
   285	       this before, but it is worth repeating . . . 
   286	
   287	                                 TYPE COMMAND 
   288	
   289	       Lets you view the internal contents of a file on the screen.
   290	       If the file is in ASCII or english text (same thing) you will be 
   291	       able to read it. If the file is not ASCII then you will see
   292	       symbols which are gibberish. Only text or ASCII files are
   293	       readable for the most part.
   294	
   295	       Examples:
   296	
   297	       C>TYPE MANUAL.DOC 
   298	
   299	       Type the contents of the file MANUAL.DOC to the screen. Remember
   300	       to use CTRL-S to pause, any key to resume scrolling and
   301	       CTRL-S to pause again.
   302	
   303	       A>TYPE B:MANUAL.DOC
   304	
   305	       Type the file MANUAL.DOC which is located on the B: drive to the 
   306	       screen.
   307	
   308	                                 PRINT COMMAND
   309	
   310	       There are actually two ways to print text or documentation files 
   311	       on your printer.
   312	       
   313	       Examples:
   314	
   315	       C>PRINT EXAMPLE.DOC
   316	
   317	       Prints on your printer the contents of the file EXAMPLE.DOC.
   318	       Note that PRINT command is an external file and must be present
   319	       in the default drive to be used!
   320	
   321	       C>TYPE EXAMPLE.DOC>PRN
   322	
   323	       This is a useful alternative method of accomplishing the same 
   324	       result by using the TYPE command which is an internal command, 
   325	       always available and redirecting the output to a printer. The small
   326	       > symbol is found as a shifted period mark on most keyboards
   327	       and in other locations on your keyboard. Be sure to find and try 
   328	       the > symbol. 
   329	
   330	       NOTE! To stop printing use the CTRL-C key combination to stop the 
   331	       printing and completely abort. CTRL-C works to abort just about 
   332	       ANY DOS operation safely.
   333

   336	       
   337	                            COPYING THE MASTER DISK
   338	       
   339	       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
   340	       
   341	       Now that you know a little DOS, be aware that the first step to 
   342	       accomplish with any disk of shareware is to copy your original 
   343	       diskette onto another blank formatted floppy. Then work with the 
   344	       copy and safely store the original just in case a problem 
   345	       arises, a file is deleted, or you accidentally copy other files 
   346	       over the shareware program diskette you need. It's a good idea to
   347	       also put a write protect tab over the notch of the original disk
   348	       before you use it so that data cannot accidentally be deleted.
   349

   352	                   THE DIRECTORY LISTING OF A SHAREWARE DISK
   353	       
   354	       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
   355	       
   356	       The next step is to use the DIR command to list the contents
   357	       of a disk so you can do a little detective work and determine
   358	       the disk contents and locate the instruction text files which 
   359	       are probably contained on the disk.
   360	
   361	       We have already given examples for listing a directory to the 
   362	       screen in our previous DOS lesson. Another option is to print 
   363	       the directory on your printer and carefully highlight or pencil 
   364	       notes about the files on the paper which is a good idea for 
   365	       beginners at first.
   366	
   367	       Example for printing a directory of a disk onto paper:
   368	
   369	       A>DIR B:>PRN
   370	
   371	       Prints the directory of files on the B: floppy drive to your
   372	       printer.

   376	              FILE NAMES AND EXTENSIONS - THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM
   377	
   378	       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
   379	
   380	       To the beginner, DOS is a little cryptic in its use of file 
   381	       names. Study the example directory listing below and the
   382	       notes to the right of the listing:
   383	
   384	       PCPC     EXE    51489   5-03-86   3:36p   ---> PCPC.EXE          
   385	       PCPR     EXE    21457   5-03-86   3:29p   ---> PCPR.EXE          
   386	       PCPY     EXE    32017   5-03-86   3:39p   ---> PCPY.EXE          
   387	       README            128   5-03-86  12:46p   ---> README
   388	       NOTES565 TXT     1390   7-03-86   8:31a   ---> NOTES565.TXT
   389	       
   390	       In each case you will note the REAL file name to the right and 
   391	       the directory listing version to the left. The point is that
   392	       in DOS, filenames always have a name, a period or dot and an
   393	       optional (but highly useful) extension. This is a very important 
   394	       point!
   395	       
   396	                        KEYS TO THE SHAREWARE KINGDOM!
   397	
   398	       Study the following list carefully, perhaps print it on paper 
   399	       and mark it with a colored highlighter. This list contains a 
   400	       roster of filename extensions which reveals the type of file and 
   401	       its possible contents and application. 
   402	
   403	             FILE EXTENSIONS WHICH PROBABLY CONTAIN DOCUMENTATION,

   416	       
   417	             FILENAMES (WITH OR WITHOUT EXTENSIONS) WHICH PROBABLY
   418	                     CONTAIN INSTRUCTIONS OR PRINTED TEXT

   424	       READ.NOW   ---------> VERY IMPORTANT TEXT FILE
   425	       
   426	       NOTE! There are so many variations of the "READ..." theme that
   427	       hopefully you can imagine other variations of this "READ..."
   428	       concept!
   429	       
   430	       If you stop and think about it for a minute, most of these 
   431	       extensions and filenames offer strong clues about file contents 
   432	       and phonetically "hint" to you what the file contains. Here are 
   433	       some examples you might actually see. Note the "clues" that tell 
   434	       you text or instructions are available inside the file:

   476	       Some disk vendors try to help you by putting their own files 
   477	       on a disk with a little extra information. The following file 
   478	       examples might offer help in text or documentation form.
   479	       An advanced shareware user would guess quickly that these files
   480	       refer to a disk from a shareware vendor or computer club library
   481	       and are most probably disk number 565 in a larger set of 
   482	       programs that vendor or club offers in a library collection.

   486	       
   487	       If you buy a disk from a disk vendor named BEST VALUE SHAREWARE
   488	       DISTRIBUTORS you might look for files such as the following 
   489	       which also contain text, BAT, COM or other file startup information.
   490	       
   491	       Each vendor might use a different system, but watch for these 
   492	       patterns as you list directory information on a shareware disk. 
   493	       With the variety of methods, your best bet is to study filename 
   494	       extensions for a few minutes and "play detective" which for some 
   495	       folks is a bit of the interest in using shareware!

   508	                  COM, EXE AND BAT FILES START PROGRAMS 
   509	       
   510	       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
   511	       
   512	       A file ending in EXE or COM is a file which contains a 
   513	       EXECUTABLE OR "RUNNABLE" program and is a way to start a 
   514	       software package. 
   515	       
   516	       Examples:
   517	
   518	       To start PCF.EXE do this    PCF  (then press enter).  
   519	       For DBFKK.EXE               DBFKK (then press enter.) 
   520	       
   521	       Some files which end in BAS will need a basic interpreter such 
   522	       as GWBASIC.EXE to operate. Example files would be GAME.BAS or 
   523	       MUSIC.BAS. GWBASIC.EXE is usually included on your DOS disk
   524	       which came with the computer.
   525	       
   526	       Another standard of shareware programs is to use batch files to 
   527	       start programs. GO.BAT or MENU.BAT or START.BAT or INSTALL.BAT 
   528	       are "batch files." Simply type the first word at the prompt to 
   529	       proceed.  
   530	       
   531	       Example: for file GO.BAT       GO (then press enter). 
   532	
   533	       DOS searches a disk for programs to run in a precise order:
   534	
   535	       HELLO.COM  ---------> Run this first if found then try 
   536	       HELLO.EXE  ---------> to find and run this then
   537	       HELLO.BAT  ---------> try to find and run this.
   538	              
   539	       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
   540	       
   541	                               BASIC DATA FILES
   542	       
   543	       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
   544	
   545	       If you find a BASIC program file which ends in .BAS try this
   546	       per the following example . . .
   547	
   548	       For the file HELLO.BAS, first copy both GWBASIC.EXE
   549	       and HELLO.BAS to a blank formatted diskette. Then issue the 
   550	       command:
   551	
   552	       A>GWBASIC HELLO
   553	
   554	       Another alternative is to leave GWBASIC.EXE on your hard drive 
   555	       and tell it where the basic program is located. 
   556	
   557	       Example:     C>GWBASIC A:HELLO
   558	
   559	       The above example assumes a copy of GWBASIC.EXE resides on your 
   560	       hard drive and a floppy containing the basic program HELLO.BAS 
   561	       is on the A: drive.
   562	
   563	       The program will be loaded into GWBASIC and run. If you
   564	       don't care for the program, try to exit if the program gives
   565	       you a menu of choices, otherwise press CTRL-BREAK keys
   566	       at same time which will let GWBASIC exit. You will see an
   567	       "OK" prompt. Type the word "system" and press the return/enter 
   568	       key to return you to DOS and leave GWBASIC. 
   569	
   570	       Basic is a rather elegant and precise programming system if you 
   571	       are interested! Pick up a book at your local library and you can 
   572	       learn how to use GWBASIC.EXE on your DOS disk to write and modify 
   573	       your own elaborate custom programs! Also investigate the
   574	       availability of affordable Basic compiler programs which prepare 
   575	       speedy .EXE free standing programs rather than requiring you to 
   576	       haul out your GWBASIC.EXE file each time you wish to run the 
   577	       program.

   588	       lists are similar to what you might see on your screen when using 
   589	       the DIR command when you first explore a new software disk. Brief

   613	       Note that on the above disk the LARGEST file PCPAY.DOC contains
   614	       64,512 bytes. Its size leads to strong suspicion it contains 
   615	       the main documentation. Shorter files probably contain other 
   616	       useful data. The two files at the bottom of the directory listing 
   617	       make one suspect this disk in number 565 in a club library or 
   618	       disk vendor collection. Sherlock Holmes would approve of our

   658	       
   659	       This is a disk with several important documentation files, but
   660	       a highly unusual second subdirectory! COMFILES <DIR> contains
   661	       other file(s) and must ALSO be examined. The DOS CD or
   662	       change directory command must be used to examine this other
   663	       subdirectory or file storage area of the disk. See your DOS manual.
   664	       Most shareware authors try to stay away from using additional
   665	       subdirectories on a disk which can confuse a beginner. The file
   666	       LASTMIN.ANN would tell an advanced shareware user that the file
   667	       contains "last minute announcements" and is most probably 
   668	       a text file. TUTR.DOC probably means "tutorial document."
   669	       QUICK.DOC is probably quick startup documentation.
   670	                  
   671

   673	
   674	       
   675	       This is an odd disk indeed. No documentation? Actually this
   676	       is a special SELF-EXTRACTING file which is usually copied
   677	       to a hard drive run with the command HM. The file will proceed 
   678	       to unpack itself and produce several files containing 
   679	       documentation, COM or EXE files and more! Most authors would
   680	       include a small README file on the disk to advise you of this 
   681	       fact, but this author has omitted even that! If you locate a 
   682	       large EXE file, copy it to your hard drive (perhaps into
   683	       a subdirectory named TEMP or temporary) and then run the
   684	       file to cause it to unpack and produce all the little subfiles
   685	       which are the main program! Shareware authors do this to 
   686	       conserve disk space or otherwise compress large programs to
   687	       fit onto fewer disks.
   688	                                                            
   689

   695	
   696	       READ1ST.EXE is run since it is a self-extracting EXE file which 
   697	       probably produces documentation notes. The other three files are 
   698	       probably self-extracting files which produce three separate 
   699	       programs. This is a case of multiple self-extracting files! A

   701	       disk!

   726	       
   727	                           A TURBOCHARGED SHORTCUT!
   728	       
   729	       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
   730	       
   731	       There is always a shortcut to any process if you apply a little 
   732	       thought and a bit of technology. As mentioned previously, you 
   733	       need to identify files on a disk containing text or 
   734	       instruction documentation and then view the contents of the 
   735	       file. A previous section showed you how to use the DOS TYPE
   736	       and PRINT commands to print the contents of a suspected text 
   737	       file to either the screen or paper.
   738	
   739	       If DOS commands and structure are not interesting or you don't 
   740	       have the time to learn DOS, there exist programs called DOS 
   741	       SHELLS which essentially provide DOS access for routine things 
   742	       like moving and copying files AND QUICKLY VIEWING THE INTERNAL
   743	       CONTENTS OF SUSPECTED TEXT FILES; these menu programs hide the 
   744	       DOS commands behind a series of "point and select" choices 
   745	       similar to the point and shoot menus you use on game programs 
   746	       and serious business software. 
   747	       
   748	       The typical DOS shell is a package which surrounds DOS (like a 
   749	       shell, hence the name) and allows you to perform the most common 
   750	       DOS functions by pressing only one or two keys or moving a 
   751	       highlighted arrow. Very appealing for beginners! This may be
   752	       all the DOS control most people need . . .
   753	
   754	       Some practical and easy DOS shell packages include: Still River 
   755	       Shell, DOS2ools, PC Tools, Powermenu, Automenu, Dirmagic and 
   756	       Directory Freedom. DR.COM and its companion shell programs
   757	       CO.COM and RN.COM are extremely simple shells suited for
   758	       beginners which most computer clubs and shareware disk vendors
   759	       carry. The author of this package uses the Directory Freedom 
   760	       shell which you may also wish to investigate.
   761	       
   762	       If you are beginner and don't want to be troubled learning DOS, 
   763	       then a shell program is the easiest way to use the PC. And one 
   764	       of the easier ways to view text files.
   765

   768	                           UNPACKING AND INSTALLING 
   769	                      INCLUDING ARCS, ZIPS, LZH AND MORE
   770	
   771	       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
   772	
   773	       Many times a shareware package is quite large and has been 
   774	       compressed or "archived" to fit on the disk. Another use for 
   775	       archiving, or packing many files into one highly compressed 
   776	       file, is to decrease telephone charges and time when transmitting 
   777	       files by modem. In a previous section we indicated the following 
   778	       filename extensions as pertaining to compressed or "archived" files:
   779	
   780	       .ZIP       ---------> Compressed file, use PKUNZIP to unpack
   781	       .ARC       ---------> Compressed file, use ARC system 
   782	       .PAK       ---------> Compressed file, use PAK system
   783	       .LZH       ---------> Compressed file, use LHARC
   784	       .ZOO       ---------> Compressed file, use ZOO system
   785	
   786	       Let's take a closer look. For example, the file FUN454.ZIP
   787	       might contain the following files contained within the
   788	       ZIP archive.
   789	       
   790	       FUNNELS  EXE                                         
   791	       FUNNELS  DOC                                           
   792	       FUNNELS  INV                                         
   793	       ATC      DAT                                         
   794	       FUNNELS  SCR                                         
   795	       FUNNELS  TXT                            
   796	       
   797	       By the way, in the above example, FUN454.ZIP, we are given the
   798	       probable clue that this might be Version 4.54 of the program.
   799	       This is another odd but useful convention when dealing with
   800	       the shareware community and archived or compressed files.
   801	
   802	       In the shareware trade, one frequently hears the terms "ARCING, 
   803	       ZIPPING, UNZIPPING, LHARCING, PAKING" and similar terms. You 
   804	       can quickly understand that "archive processing" or compressing 
   805	       and uncompressing disk files is what these terms refer to!
   806	
   807	       Not all disks contain archives - some do, some don't. To unpack 
   808	       the program you need a few blank floppies (or a hard drive) and 
   809	       a special unpacking utility program to unpack. If your software 
   810	       needs this utility, it is usually available on one (or several) of 
   811	       your disks or can be ordered from most computer clubs or shareware 
   812	       disk vendors. Here is how to unpack an archive file ending in 
   813	       ZIP. Other files ending in .LZH, .ZOO and other file extensions
   814	       are quite similar in use.
   815	       
   816	       Files which end in .ZIP are unpacked with PKUNZIP.EXE. For our 
   817	       example let's pretend we are unpacking the file SAMPLE.ZIP. 
   818	            
   819	       Start with a BLANK formatted floppy. Copy the program file you 
   820	       wish to unpack (e.g., SAMPLE.ZIP) and the file PKUNZIP.EXE 
   821	       onto the blank floppy. Hard drive users may prefer to simply 
   822	       copy the file to be unpacked and the unpacking utility 
   823	       PKUNZIP.EXE to their hard drive. For our example, SAMPLE.ZIP and 
   824	       PKUNZIP.EXE are now on a floppy in the A: drive.                     
   825	
   826	       Next we need a place to put the unpacked files! For computers 
   827	       without a hard drive put a blank formatted floppy in your other 
   828	       empty B: floppy drive. This is where the unpacked newly expanded 
   829	       files will go: the DESTINATION OR TARGET drive for the unpacked 
   830	       software. Hard drive users will probably just unpack to the hard 
   831	       drive (C:) using a subdirectory on the hard drive as the target 
   832	       area.
   833	                                                  
   834	       Using the examples which follow, type an unpacking command 
   835	       showing the source drive containing the packed file, the name of 
   836	       file and the final destination drive; press enter or return key 
   837	       after typing the unpacking command. Of course, substitute the 
   838	       name of the file you are using for the file SAMPLE.ZIP. Blank 
   839	       spaces in the command ARE essential. 
   840	
   841	       EXAMPLE:             A>pkunzip A:SAMPLE.ZIP B: 
   842	
   843	       Translation: unpack or unzip all files from the packed file 
   844	       SAMPLE.ZIP contained on the A: floppy drive and send the 
   845	       unpacked files to the B: floppy drive. Press enter or return key 
   846	       after typing the command.
   847	
   848	       EXAMPLE:             C>pkunzip C:sample.ZIP B: 
   849	
   850	       Unpack files from C: hard drive area to a blank floppy on B: 
   851	       drive. 
   852	
   853	       By the way, you can omit the .ZIP file extension for a shortcut.
   854	
   855	       EXAMPLE:               C>pkunzip C:sample B:
   856	
   857	       Files are now unpacked and ready to use in the conventional 
   858	       manner - after unpacking you will probably see the readme, text 
   859	       and documentation files you need. The data is now in a more 
   860	       familiar DOS file format. The archive can "inflate" more than 
   861	       200% from its compressed format in some cases! 
   862	
   863	       Some programs are very large and may be submitted to you in 
   864	       several parts. You might find a program which consists of 
   865	       three or four packed .ZIP, .LZH or other archive file(s) on 
   866	       several disks.
   867	
   868	       NOTE! for hard drive users you are usually wise to unpack each 
   869	       program to a separate subdirectory on your hard disk. For 
   870	       example, to use pcwrite you might unpack the files to C:\PCW. Of 
   871	       course, you must first create a subdirectory called PCW on your 
   872	       hard drive BEFORE you start. To prepare a subdirectory, use the 
   873	       DOS md (make directory) command (example  c>md pcw.)  Hard drive 
   874	       users might wish to delete the original compressed ARC/ZIP files 
   875	       from their hard drive since the unpacked versions are now ready 
   876	       and the original floppies serve as your backup copies.    
   877	
   878	                    UNPACKING ARCHIVED/COMPRESSED PROGRAMS 
   879	                 ON SINGLE FLOPPY SYSTEMS LACKING A HARD DRIVE
   880	       
   881	       A problem arises trying to uncompress archived programs on 
   882	       single drive systems. Most computers have at least two drives. 
   883	       
   884	       On a single drive system you may need to uncompress your 
   885	       programs to a special memory area of the computer called a RAM 
   886	       DRIVE. Your DOS manual covers this option or you can obtain a 
   887	       shareware package which produces a ram drive and thus allows 
   888	       your computer to "think" it has two floppy drives. This is 
   889	       about the only alternative for unpacking software on a single 
   890	       drive machine. Generally single drive computers may not be fully 
   891	       IBM compatible with many modern software packages which may need 
   892	       two drives. Suggest you 1) return disks to vendor for refund or 2) 
   893	       consider adding a second drive as most modern fully compatible 
   894	       machines offer or 3) attempt unpacking with a RAM DRIVE then 
   895	       copy back to disk. Later versions of DOS contain a RAM DRIVE
   896	       program. You can also obtain RAM DRIVE programs from shareware
   897	       and other software vendors.

   901	                     CONFIGURING THE PROGRAM IF NECESSARY
   902	  
   903	       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
   904	
   905	       Many times a software program must be configured prior to being
   906	       actually used. This means that possibly screen colors, type of 
   907	       disk drives, optional accessories such as a mouse or modem, 
   908	       printer types and other features must be activated. Some 
   909	       software programs allow you to configure this information 
   910	       directly within the main program. Other programs prefer that
   911	       you run a separate small "configuration" program first. 
   912	       
   913	       The only useful rule in this case is to read the documentation 
   914	       or at least study the table of contents or index to see if 
   915	       configuration is a necessary step.
   916

   918	
   919	                           TIME TO RUN THE PROGRAM!
   920	
   921	       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
   922	
   923	       From a previous chapter of this tutorial we again offer the
   924	       reminder that the following file extension relate to a file
   925	       or program that can be run!
   926	
   927	
   928	       .EXE       ---------> An EXECUTABLE FILE which starts program
   929	       .COM       ---------> A COMMAND FILE which starts program
   930	       .BAT       ---------> BATCH FILE which starts program
   931	       .BAS       ---------> BASIC file which can be run with
   932	                             the aid of the GWBASIC interpreter
   933	                             GWBASIC which is normally on your DOS
   934	                             disk or hard drive.
   935	
   936	       Examples: 
   937	
   938	       File is HMFAST.EXE. To start, assuming the file is on the C: 
   939	       hard drive,
   940	
   941	       C>HMFAST   <then press enter or return key>   starts program.
   942	
   943	       File is ASEASY.COM. To start, assuming the file is on the A:
   944	       floppy drive,
   945	
   946	       A>ASEASY   <then press enter or return key>   starts program.
   947

   950	
   951	                FEEDBACK: EITHER REGISTER OR SEND YOUR REGRETS!

   953	       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
   954	       
   955	       The last step is probably the most important to a shareware 
   956	       author and for that matter the continued production of ever more 
   957	       interesting and useful shareware:
   958	
   959	       Register the package if it proves truly useful. Send a 19 cent
   960	       postcard to the author if you don't register with a few observations, 
   961	       constructive criticisms or at least suggestions. The fact that 
   962	       you were interested enough in the program to try it means that 
   963	       it might be VERY close to what you need. Inexpensive postcard 
   964	       feedback just might result in a program change by the author 
   965	       which gives you a "perfect fit." You would be surprised how 
   966	       responsive shareware authors are in revising a program QUICKLY 
   967	       to meet a customer request. You might even say this is about 
   968	       the closest thing to having your own personal programmer
   969	       on the staff as you will ever find!

   972	
   973	                         COMMON QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
   974	       
   975	       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
   976	      
   977	             PROBLEMS USING COLOR SOFTWARE ON MONOCHROME COMPUTERS
   978	       
   979	       Some shareware programs (usually games and a few others) require 
   980	       a color circuit within the computer called CGA, EGA or VGA 
   981	       color graphics. If you start the program on a monochrome (no 
   982	       color) computer you may see nothing on the screen! 
   983	       
   984	       Solutions: 1) Use an inexpensive software program (e.g., SIMCGA) 
   985	       which helps monochrome machine pretend (emulate) color 2) Buy a 
   986	       CGA, VGA or EGA circuit card 3) check the documents which come 
   987	       with the shareware package to see if it can be switched from color 
   988	       mode to monochrome. 
   989	
   990	       Turn off your computer and restart it if you use a program such
   991	       as SIMCGA or other software patch to help a monochrome computer
   992	       emulate a color machine. You don't want the emulation program
   993	       interfering with other software you may wish to run later.
   994	
   995	       Problem: Computer responds with "bad command or filename."
   996	
   997	       Solution: Make sure that what you typed at the DOS command line 
   998	       is EXACTLY the filename you intended to run. This is probably a
   999	       simple typing mistake.
  1000	
  1001	       Problem: Program asks for a file which is not on the disk.
  1002	
  1003	       Solution: Do you have ALL of the disks required. Have you 
  1004	       unpacked all archives? Have you run the configuration program
  1005	       which creates the missing file?
  1006	
  1007	       Problem: Screen goes blank and machine locks up.
  1008	
  1009	       Solution: Sounds like this is a color program trying to run on
  1010	       a monochrome system. See the notes above.
  1011	
  1012	       Problem: Incorrect DOS version message.
  1013	
  1014	       Solution: Many sophisticated programs cannot use older
  1015	       DOS versions such as 2.0 or 2.11. Check the documentation.
  1016	       There might be a way around this that the author suggests 
  1017	       towards the end of the program instructions.
  1018	
  1019	       Problem: Only have one disk drive. 
  1020	
  1021	       Solution: Refer to DOS manual or obtain separate standalone
  1022	       RAM disk software which can create a second drive in your 
  1023	       computer's RAM memory area. This is still a severe limitation
  1024	       and you are advised to at least purchase a second floppy drive
  1025	       which is not terribly expensive, these days.
  1026	
  1027	       Problem: Author did not respond to my questions or send anything
  1028	       for my registration check. 
  1029	
  1030	       Solution: Authors can move and change address. Contact a 
  1031	       shareware disk vendor, obtain the latest version of the program 
  1032	       and see if the address of the author has changed. Call or write 
  1033	       again.
  1034	
  1035	       Problem: I want to know more about shareware!
  1036	
  1037	       Solution: Explore the following . . .
