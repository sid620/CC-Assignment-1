   164	                          INTRODUCTION
   165	
   166	
   167	The WELL is a low-cost, computerized conferencing system centered 
   168	in the San Francisco Bay Area with international access through 
   169	UNINET.  The system runs on a VAX minicomputer with a capacity of 
   170	40 phone ports at the offices of the Whole Earth Catalog and 
   171	Whole Earth Review in Sausalito.  The service is co-developed 
   172	with NETI (Network Technologies, International), of Ann Arbor, 
   173	Michigan.
   174	
   175	The WELL includes private electronic mail, computerized 
   176	public and private conferencing, storage of files, and online 
   177	"chat."  
   178	
   179	With electronic mail, users can instantly transmit information to 
   180	one another without fear of a busy signal or the other 
   181	frustrations of "telephone tag."  A special "secret mail" option 
   182	lets you ensure the security of your messages.  
   183	
   184	Conferences cover a rapidly growing variety of subjects -- online 
   185	computer user groups, movie reviews, local politics, national 
   186	politics, science fiction, stock market, local gardening, 
   187	spirituality, business, even The WELL itself.  
   188	
   189	Groups can establish private conferences to which only group members 
   190	and authorized guests have access.  There is no extra charge for this 
   191	service.
   192	
   193	"Chat" lets you talk to any other person online at the same time 
   194	you are. You can also use a public "group chat" with more than 
   195	two people. 
   196	
   197	
   198	WHY THE WELL?
   199	
   200	Many people have been exposed to, and moved by, the Whole Earth 
   201	Catalog "experience".  Most of these people have no prior 
   202	computer experience.  The people at The WELL believe it can be 
   203	the influence that brings this large non-computing WEC population 
   204	and their talents and resources into the telecommunications 
   205	universe.
   206	
   207	
   208	HOW MUCH IS IT?
   209	
   210	The WELL costs $8 per month plus $3 per hour.  There is no charge 
   211	for disk storage up to 256K bytes.  Above that there is a monthly 
   212	charge of $1 per 10K.  This charge is based on a daily average of 
   213	storage in your home directory.
   214	
   215	These charges are billed monthly to the user's credit card -- 
   216	MasterCard or Visa.  Pacific Telephone's access charges appear on 
   217	your regular phone bill.  If you reach the WELL through UNINET, 
   218	those charges will appear as WELL charges on your credit card 
   219	bill.

   227	       |                                                        |
   228	       |                 As a user of the WELL,                 |
   229	       |              you own the words you write.              |
   230	       |                                                        |
   231	       |     That means you are the publisher.  You take        |
   232	       |     responsibility for their content, and no one may   |
   233	       |     reuse them without your permission.                |
   234	       |                                                        |
   235	       |     Hosts of conferences, in the community interest,   |
   236	       |     may delete a comment but may not amend it.         |
   237	       |                                                        |
   238	       |     Hosts are also empowered, under duress, to ban a   |
   239	       |     nuisance member from their conference.             |
   240	       |     Nevertheless, because hosts are not always         |
   241	       |     "present", or necessarily knowledgeable, they      |
   242	       |     cannot be held responsible for damaging comments   |
   243	       |     that appear in their conferences.  Responsibility  |
   244	       |     rests with the writer.                             |
   245	       |                                                        |
   246	       |________________________________________________________|
   247	
   248	
   249	
   250	The WELL is a community of people which functions on mutual 
   251	respect and cooperation.  Computer conferencing is a totally 
   252	different medium from FTF (face-to-face) communication.  The 
   253	facial expressions, tones of voice, and other nuances we use in 
   254	live conversations are totally lost on The WELL.  
   255	
   256	All that travels over the phone lines is words.  Please pay 
   257	careful attention to how you use those words.  Sarcasm, for 
   258	example, doesn't travel well.  Which is why people frequently use 
   259	such symbols as  :-)  (Look at it sideways) when they want to let 
   260	someone know that what they have just entered was meant to be 
   261	humorous.
   262	
   263	Remember that words you might enter in a burst of inspired 
   264	passion or indignant anger will be there for you (and everyone) 
   265	to read long after your intense feelings have disappeared.  This 
   266	isn't meant to discourage spontaneity and the expression of 
   267	feelings on The WELL.  It's merely to remind you to be aware of 
   268	the long-term existence and effects of what you write. (Some 
   269	conferences have a special "flame" topic where members can rant 
   270	and rave to their heart's content.)
   271	
   272	Please remember that it's safer, more polite, and more persuasive 
   273	to attack a person's comments rather than the person him/herself 
   274	when you find you disagree with what they've said. 
   275	
   276	People on The WELL generally avoid "obscene" language (no, we're 
   277	not going to try to define that here) except in conferences where 
   278	such language is acceptable - or even encouraged.  There are no 
   279	rigid rules about this.  Just remember we are a heterogeneous 
   280	community of individuals with varying standards.
   281	
   282	Naturally, information on passwords for this and other systems, 
   283	credit card numbers or any other information which was gained or 
   284	can be used illegally is not allowed.
   285	
   286	It's very helpful to make full use of the Help and Test 
   287	conferences during your first days on The WELL.  Don't leave 
   288	requests for help (and complaints about The WELL) in every 
   289	conference you enter.  The Help conference is for asking 
   290	questions, the Test conference for practicing entering items 
   291	and responses and editing them.  
   292	
   293	If you have any questions on what's appropriate in a particular 
   294	conference, just ask the conference host(s).  All hosts are 
   295	volunteers who are very willing to help out new users on The 
   296	WELL.
   297	
   298	
   299	
   300	HINTS ON USING THIS MANUAL AND THE WELL 
   301	
   302	Note:  Whenever you log on to The WELL or give a command at a prompt 
   303	in The WELL, make sure you type the command in lowercase.  Uppercase 
   304	can cause problems such as slashes interspersed throughout your 
   305	onscreen text.
   306	
   307	When you see this:  <cr>   in the manual or onscreen help 
   308	information, it means "carriage return".  You should press the 
   309	Return key on your computer.  This key may say "return", "enter", 
   310	or simply have an arrow like this: <--'.
   311	
   312	
   313	Example:  When you see something like this:
   314	
   315	At the prompt, type      mail <cr>      
   316	
   317	It means type the word "mail" and then do a Carriage Return by 
   318	pressing the Return or Enter key. 
   319	
   320	
   321	LOGGING ON TO THE WELL (including UNINET)
   322	
   323	If you're logging on for the first time to register with The 
   324	WELL, you'll need to have your credit card number (Visa or 
   325	MasterCard) and its expiration date available.  You'll choose a 
   326	user identification (userid) and a temporary password during the 
   327	registration procedure.
   328	
   329	
   330	1.   Make sure your computer system, communications software, and 
   331	     modem are properly installed and operating.  For full 
   332	     information, see their respective instruction manuals.
   333	
   334	2.  In the San Francisco Bay Area
   335	
   336	          Dial The WELL's Sausalito number (332-6106) or the 
   337	          packet-switching number (440-1444).  (More on the 
   338	          packet later in this manual.)
   339	
   340	
   341	    Through UNINET (across the U.S. and in 50 countries)
   342	
   343	               Note: To reach UNINET outside the U.S., contact 
   344	               your local postal, telephone, and telegraph (PTT) 
   345	               administration.  Tell them you want to link up 
   346	               with UNINET and ask them what procedure to follow.
   347	
   348	
   349	         To find out your local UNINET number, call UNINET at 
   350	         800-821-5340.  Then dial the number you're given.  
   351	
   352	         You'll see:
   353	
   354	         L?
   355	
   356	         (If the L? appears garbled, perhaps as XXX, just 
   357	         continue.  It means the network hasn't yet determined 
   358	         your terminal's operating speed.)
   359	
   360	         Type     <cr> period <cr>
   361	
   362	         You'll see:
   363	
   364	         uninet pad xxxxxx port yy
   365	         service:
   366	
   367	         Type   well <cr>
   368	
   369	
   370	3.   When you connect with The WELL, you'll see a prompt 
   371	     something like this: 
   372	
   373	         Welcome to the WELL--lower case input only, please...
   374	
   375	         Type User I.D. or "newuser"
   376	
   377	         login:
   378	
   379	
   380	4.  If you are not yet registered with The WELL, 
   381	
   382	         type      newuser <cr>      
   383	
   384	         You'll see a series of questions which lead you through 
   385	         registering with The WELL.  
   386	
   387	    If you have already registered with The WELL,
   388	
   389	         type    youruserid <cr>. 
   390	
   391	          (The userid is the identification you are given when 
   392	          you register with The WELL. Make sure you use 
   393	          lowercase letters.)
   394	
   395	5.   Next you'll see the password prompt      password:
   396	
   397	6.   Type your password <cr>. (You are given a temporary password 
   398	     when you first register with The WELL. When you type this 
   399	     password, it will not appear on your screen).  Make sure you 
   400	     use lowercase letters.
   401	
   402	
   403	7.   If you have entered the right userid and password, you'll 
   404	     see a greeting something like this:
   405	 
   406	     Welcome!
   407	     You are now logged in to the WELL.

   411	
   412	     Welcome to the Entry conference
   413	
   414	
   415	After a series of text, you'll see this prompt: 
   416	
   417	     Ok:
   418	
   419	You're now ready to begin.
   420	
   421	
   422	
   423	PACIFIC TELEPHONE PACKET-SWITCHING NETWORK
   424	
   425	If you live anywhere in the 415 or 408 area codes, you can reach 
   426	The WELL more cheaply through a special Pacific Telephone number.  
   427	
   428	At the time of this manual update, there was no charge for using 
   429	this number as Pacific Telephone was still beta testing this 
   430	service.  In the near future, rates will be set and approved by 
   431	the Public Utilities Commission.  These rates will be 
   432	considerably cheaper than current long distance rates to The 
   433	WELL's Sausalito number.
   434	
   435	To use the packet, do the following:
   436	
   437	     1.   Dial 440-1444
   438	
   439	     2.   When your communications software indicates that you 
   440	          have made connection, type:  <cr> . <cr> (Return period 
   441	          Return).
   442	
   443	          You'll then see something like this:
   444	
   445	               PPS*NET: 495 271 1444
   446	
   447	     3.  Type: 4954611199 <cr>
   448	
   449	          You'll then be connected to The WELL.

   470	                       GENERAL INFORMATION
   471	
   472	
   473	CHANGING YOUR PASSWORD
   474	
   475	It's a good precaution to change your password occasionally, 
   476	perhaps every few months. This is to help prevent anyone else 
   477	discovering and using your password.  To do this:
   478	
   479	At Ok: type:    set passwd <cr>
   480	
   481	Type    oldpassword <cr>      then type     newpassword <cr>   (Your 
   482	new password should have 6-8 characters).  Next retype
   483	     newpassword <cr>       You'll return to the Ok: prompt.
   484	
   485	Note:  If you forget your password, call The WELL at (415) 332-4335 
   486	and we'll give you a new one.
   487	
   488	
   489	VIEWING ONE SCREEN AT A TIME
   490	
   491	The WELL is set up so that you view 24 lines at a time on your screen.  
   492	At the    --More--   prompt, press <spacebar>   to see the next 
   493	24 lines.  (Press   <cr>   to see one just more line.)
   494	
   495	If you would rather see information displayed continuously, which 
   496	you might want to do when viewing a long text file, type    
   497	     nopager     at the Ok: prompt.
   498	
   499	To turn the pager back on, type   define pager more 
   500	
   501	
   502	IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY LOGGED ON IN UPPERCASE
   503	
   504	Uppercase makes The WELL do funny things, most of them 
   505	undesirable, like lots of /backslashes/
   506	
   507	To get out of this state, at the Ok: prompt, type      !stty -lcase
   508	
   509	
   510	CHECKING YOUR STORAGE SPACE
   511	
   512	Your monthly WELL charge entitles you to 256K of free storage 
   513	space.  Excess storage space is billed at $1 per 10K. 
   514	
   515	To check how much space you're currently using, type  files -l   at 
   516	the Ok: prompt.
   517	
   518	You'll see the total amount of space used, and the size of each 
   519	individual file.
   520	
   521	To remove a file, type    !rm filename
   522	
   523	
   524	CHECKING YOUR BILL
   525	
   526	To see your WELL connect time and charges since the beginning of 
   527	the month, type     bill <cr>
   528	
   529	
   530	GETTING HELP 
   531	
   532	
   533	For help information at any time from any prompt, type    help
   534	or      ?
   535	
   536	For help information on a specific command or topic, type
   537	   help command/topic name       Example:    help  mail     or    
   538	   help  conferences
   539

   640	CONFERENCE HOSTS
   641	
   642	Each conference has one or two hosts who have the responsibility of 
   643	looking after the conference.  A host's primary job is to keep people 
   644	on track by encouraging useful responses and at the same time 
   645	encouraging less useful discussions to move to other more appropriate 
   646	conferences.  A host can also kill topics, and maintain the 
   647	greeting and farewell messages you see. 
   648	
   649	If you have a question about the conference, contact its host.  
   650	Type       display fw      at the conference prompt (Ok:) to see 
   651	the name of the host(s). ("fw" stands for "fair-witness", which 
   652	was an earlier term for hosts.)
   653	
   654	
   655	
   656	GOING TO A CONFERENCE
   657	
   658	At the Ok: prompt, type     go conferencename
   659	
   660	Example:    go movie  (or simply   go mov) 
   661	
   662	
   663	   Note:  You can also type      menu      to use The WELL's 
   664	          menu system.  Menus are a slower way to use The WELL, 
   665	          but are often easier for new users.  Take your choice.  
   666	          This manual deals only with the command system, which 
   667	          does not use menus.
   668	
   669	
   670	If it's your first time at the conference you'll see a prompt 
   671	something like this: 
   672	
   673	       You are not a member of /well/confs/movie_reviews  
   674	       Do you wish to: 
   675	
   676	       Join, quit or help?
   677	
   678	Type    j    so you become a member of the conference, and can 
   679	read and respond to all messages.  If you type    q   you return 
   680	back to the Ok: prompt. If you type   h    you'll see information 
   681	on the options available to you. 
   682	
   683	After you type    j  you'll see a prompt that looks something 
   684	like this: 
   685	
   686	
   687	     Welcome to the Movie Review Conference
   688	     1 brandnew topic
   689	     First topic 1, last 108
   690	     Your name is John Fellows in this conference.
   691	
   692	     Ok (? for help) :
   693	
   694	The Ok: prompt is the prompt for all conferences.  You can now 
   695	give any conference command. To see a list of the commands 
   696	available at the Ok: prompt, type      help      To see a list of 
   697	commands available throughout The WELL, type      sum
   698	
   699	
   700	SEEING THE NAME OF THE CONFERENCE YOU'RE CURRENTLY IN
   701	
   702	Sometimes it's easy to forget which conference you're in.  To find 
   703	out, type     g    at the Ok: prompt.  You'll see the name of the 
   704	conference.   
   705	
   706	For more information, type    display conference     You'll see the 
   707	conference name, your participation file in that conference, how many 
   708	topics are currently in the conference, and various other information.
   709	
   710	
   711	PARTICIPATING IN A CONFERENCE
   712	
   713	A conference is a series of numbered topics, all related to 
   714	the general subject of the conference.  Each topic has a 
   715	series of numbered responses.  These are people's comments about 
   716	the topic.  Any member of the conference can start a new topic or 
   717	respond to existing topics. 
   718	
   719	At the conference prompt (Ok:), you can type     help     to see a 
   720	list of commands (instructions you give to The WELL) available at this 
   721	prompt.
   722	
   723	
   724	
   725	
   726	                      TOPICS AND RESPONSES
   727	
   728	
   729	BROWSING TOPICS 
   730	
   731	To see only the topic headers, type    b  (for browse)   to see 
   732	all topic headers or     b n   (for browse new) to see all new
   733	topic headers in the conference.  
   734	
   735	A topic header includes the topic number, the date entered, the 
   736	author, and the subject of the topic.  Browse does not show the entire 
   737	topic.  Use the See command to look at the entire topic.
   738	
   739	To see the header for a specific topic (or topics), 
   740	type     b topic#     (Example:  b 12) (or  b 1-5)
   741	
   742	
   743	EXAMPLE: 
   744	
   745	At Ok: type    b      You'll see a list of topics under 
   746	discussion in this conference.  It will look something like this:
   747	
   748	item nresp header    (means= Topic #  Number of Responses  Header)
   749	  1 12 Holy Mountain on Fri Mar 29 16:25:40 1985 
   750	  2  7 They Might Be Giants on Fri Mar 29 18:32:12 1985 
   751	  3  8 The Escape Artist on Sat Mar 30 21:15:00 1985
   752	  4 22 Mary Poppins on Mon Apr 1 00:30:22 1985 
   753	
   754	
   755	SEARCHING TOPIC HEADERS FOR A CERTAIN WORD OR PHRASE
   756	
   757	To search for a particular word or phrase in the topic headers, type 
   758	    b "string"      (quotes are needed). String is whatever 
   759	you're looking for in the header of a topic.  For example, to look for 
   760	all headers containing the word "music", type      b "music"
   761	
   762	The WELL ignores case (upper or lower) when it searches. You cannot 
   763	search for author names.
   764	
   765	
   766	SEARCHING TOPICS AND RESPONSES FOR A CERTAIN WORD OR PHRASE
   767	
   768	To search for a particular word, phrase, or string (sequence) of 
   769	characters
   770	
   771	Type  f (for find)  <range> "string"    
   772	
   773	Example:  To search for the word "duck" throughout an entire 
   774	conference, type     f "duck"     To search for the word "duck" in 
   775	only the first five topics, type    f 1-5 "duck"    You'll see 
   776	each line that contains the word "duck", and the item number, 
   777	response number, and line number where the word occurs.
   778	
   779	
   780	SEEING TOPICS
   781	
   782	To see all topics and responses, type      s a  (for see all)
   783	(Note:  This could show you thousands of topics and responses)
   784	  
   785	To see all new topics and new responses ("new" means all topics and 
   786	responses which have been entered since you were last in the 
   787	conference),
   788	
   789	type      s
   790	
   791	To see a specific topic only, type     s topic#  
   792	(Example:  see 7).
   793	
   794	To see a series of topics, type     s topic# - topic#  
   795	(Example:  s 1 - 5)
   796	
   797	Note:  When you go to a conference for the very first time, only 
   798	the single most recent topic is presented as new.  You can then 
   799	browse the conference to see past topics.
   800	
   801	
   802	EXAMPLE: 
   803	
   804	Type     s 3     and you'll see:
   805	
   806	Topic    3:  The Escape Artist
   807	by: Mick Winter (mick) on Sat, Mar 30, '85 
   808	        3 responses so far
   809	
   810	Next you'll see the text of the topic and then its responses, 
   811	like this:
   812	
   813	#1 username:
   814	 [a response]
   815	
   816	#2 another username:
   817	 [another response]
   818	
   819	#3 another username:
   820	 [another response]
   821	
   822	
   823	SKIPPING TOPICS
   824	
   825	If a topic doesn't interest you, and you don't want to see future 
   826	responses to the topic, type    forget   at the Respond 
   827	or pass? prompt or    forget topic#   at the Ok: prompt.  
   828	     
   829	     (Example:  forget 4)
   830	
   831	From now on the topic and its responses will be passed over when you 
   832	give    b (browse) or    s (see)    commands.  
   833	
   834	You can always "remember" the topic again later by typing    
   835	remember topic#   at the Ok: prompt.  Example:  remember 4     
   836	You can also see a "forgotten" topic by requesting it 
   837	specifically.  Example:    s 4
   838	
   839	To remember all forgotten topics in a conference, you can use an 
   840	asterisk as a "wild card".  Example:    remember *
   841	
   842	
   843	
   844	SEEING RESPONSES
   845	
   846	When you see a topic, you'll automatically see its responses.
   847	
   848	NOTE:     To get to the end of the responses for a topic without 
   849	          seeing them all, press     Control-C      (hold down 
   850	          the control key and press C).
   851	
   852	You'll see a Respond or pass? prompt, where you have these options:
   853	
   854	Type    <cr>     to pass and see the next topic
   855	        r        to respond to the topic or its responses
   856	        q        to go to the Ok: prompt
   857	        again    to see the previous text displayed again
   858	        forget   to skip this topic in the future unless you
   859	                 specifically request it by number, or you
   860	                 use the "remember" command to bring it back
   861	                 into the normal flow of read and browse
   862	        new      to make anything you just saw new again
   863	        postpone to leave the topic new and go to the next topic
   864	
   865	
   866	        response#   to see that response (Example:  5)
   867	        l           to see the last response
   868	        +           to see the next response
   869	        -           to see the previous response
   870	       -2           to move back two responses
   871	       +3           to move forward three responses
   872	       since -32    to see all responses in the past 32 days
   873	        0           to see the initial text of the topic
   874	    only response#  to see a specific response only
   875	
   876	Note:  To go from the Ok: prompt to the end of the last response 
   877	of a topic, type    s topic# nor (for "no response"). Example:    
   878	   s 4 nor
   879	
   880	To see all new items in a conference without the program stopping 
   881	at the Respond or pass? prompt, type    s n pass

   884	SEEING RESPONSES OVER A PERIOD OF TIME
   885	
   886	You can see all responses which have been made over a particular 
   887	period of time.  For example, if you'd like to see responses 
   888	entered over the past 15 days, do the following at the Ok: 
   889	prompt:
   890	
   891	1.  Type    seen <cr>
   892	
   893	    This makes the WELL think you've read all responses.
   894	
   895	2.  Type    see all since -15 <cr>
   896	
   897	    To see all responses entered on the entire conference over 
   898	    the past 15 days.
   899	
   900	OR  Type    see 3 since -15 <cr>
   901	
   902	    To see all responses entered in topic 3 over the past 15 
   903	    days.
   904	
   905	OR  Type    see since 5/15/86 <cr>
   906	
   907	    To see all responses entered in the conference since 5/15/86
   908	
   909	
   910	
   911	RESPONDING TO TOPICS
   912	
   913	To respond to a topic, at the Respond or pass? prompt, type    r
   914	You'll see:
   915	
   916	   Use "." or ^D to end.
   917	   1:
   918	
   919	
   920	Type your text.  
   921	
   922	There is no word wrap on The WELL, so you have to end each line 
   923	with <cr>.  It's generally best if each line is no longer than 70 
   924	characters. 
   925	
   926	When you're finished typing your text, type a period by itself at 
   927	the beginning of a line and press <cr>, or just press Control-D.
   928	
   929	You'll then see:
   930	
   931	   Edit command (? for help):
   932	
   933	Type    s    (for send).  Your response is then entered into the 
   934	topic.
   935	
   936	
   937	
   938	ENTERING TOPICS
   939	
   940	To enter a new topic which can be read and responded to by everyone in 
   941	the conference, at the Ok: or Respond or pass? prompt, type    e 
   942	(for enter) 
   943	
   944	You'll see:
   945	
   946	   Use "." or ^D to end.
   947	   1:
   948	
   949	
   950	Now follow the procedure previously shown for Responding to 
   951	Topics.  After you've typed   s   for  send, you'll see:
   952	
   953	   Enter a one line header or ":" to edit
   954	
   955	Type up to 70 characters which summarize your topic.  Do not use all 
   956	upper case.  (It's hard to read.)  When users browse topics, 
   957	they'll see only this heading, so make sure it tells them what 
   958	the topic's about.  When you're finished, press <cr>.  You'll 
   959	see:
   960	
   961	   OK to enter this item?
   962	
   963	Type   y <cr>    You'll see:
   964	
   965	   Saving as topic 24...saved.
   966	
   967	
   968	PRACTICING ENTERING TOPICS AND RESPONSES
   969	
   970	Most of us feel a little uneasy at first about entering topics or 
   971	responses, particularly if we're unfamiliar with the procedure for 
   972	doing this.  That's the purpose of the Test Conference.
   973	
   974	If you want a place to practice where nobody will care how sloppy your 
   975	message looks, type     go test     at any Ok: prompt.  Once you're in 
   976	the Test Conference, you can practice writing topics, and responses, 
   977	and editing those items.  
   978	
   979	
   980	PSEUDONYMS
   981	
   982	To use a name other than your own as the author of the response, type
   983	   pseudo      (for "pseudonym") at the Respond or pass? prompt.  
   984	
   985	You'll see:    What's your handle?
   986	
   987	Type the pseudonym you want to use and press <cr>. You'll then see the 
   988	standard prompt for beginning a response.  
   989	
   990	Note:  Even when you use a pseudonym, your real userid still appears 
   991	in the response. 
   992	
   993	
   994	
   995	                              MAIL
   996	
   997	
   998	To exchange private messages with other people using The WELL.
   999	
  1000	
  1001	
  1002	RECEIVING MAIL
  1003	
  1004	
  1005	You'll be told if you have any mail each time you log on to The WELL 
  1006	or join a conference ("You have mail"), or if new mail arrives while 
  1007	you are on ("You have more mail").  
  1008	
  1009	
  1010	READING MAIL
  1011	
  1012	If there is a message that you have mail, type     mail   at the Ok: 
  1013	or Respond or pass? prompts.  You'll see information about your mail 
  1014	including who it is from and when it was mailed.
  1015	
  1016	Next, at the & prompt, 
  1017	
  1018	type       ? for help information
  1019	
  1020	           p (for print) x  (where x is the number of the message 
  1021	                            you want to see)  (Example:  p 3  
  1022	                or          prints message number 3)
  1023	           t (for type)  x
  1024	           
  1025	           <cr>   to see the first message
  1026	           
  1027	           help   to see a list of mail options
  1028	
  1029	After you've seen the message, you can type any of the following:
  1030	
  1031	           q      Quit - messages are filed as read and you 
  1032	                    return to the conference prompt
  1033	           x      Exit - all messages are considered unread
  1034	           p      Print the same message again
  1035	           s [file]  save (Example:  s george   saves the 
  1036	                  message you just read to a file named george.
  1037	           w [file]  save (without header)
  1038	           -      Print previous (scroll backward one message)
  1039	           d      Delete current message
  1040	           u      Undelete a message you just deleted
  1041	           h      lists the messages in your mailbox by number
  1042	           +      Next (scroll forward one message without deleting)
  1043	           n      Show next message
  1044	           m userid  begin a message to userid
  1045	           !cmd   Execute command while remaining in mail
  1046	           f      Print headers of all messages
  1047	           r      To reply to the message with a copy of your 
  1048	                  reply going to every person who received the 
  1049	                  original message
  1050	           pre    To have the message kept in your list of 
  1051	                  unread mail
  1052	           <cr>   Your message will be kept in your mailbox
  1053	           top #  Prints the first few lines of the message 
  1054	                  number given
  1055	
  1056	Note:  The simplest thing to do after typing mail is to answer each 
  1057	prompt with a <cr>.  You'll see all your messages in order, and 
  1058	they'll all be saved in your "mailbox" for future viewing.
  1059	
  1060	When you see the message    At EOF   (End Of File) you'll know 
  1061	there are no more messages for you to read.
  1062	
  1063	If mail you receive was sent to more than one addressee, replying 
  1064	with     r    sends your response to all addressees.  If you 
  1065	reply with    R    your response goes to only the original 
  1066	sender.
  1067	
  1068	
  1069	RESPONDING TO MAIL
  1070	
  1071	To respond to a letter, type   r    at the & prompt.  Type your 
  1072	letter, then close with a Control-D on a line by itself.
  1073	
  1074	
  1075	
  1076	DELETING MAIL YOU'VE READ 
  1077	
  1078	After you've read a message, you'll still be at the & prompt. Type   
  1079	    d <cr>     The message you just read will be deleted.
  1080	
  1081	(To have the message automatically saved in your mailbox, just go 
  1082	on to the next letter or type    q (for quit) if there are no 
  1083	more letters).
  1084	
  1085	To delete more than one message, type    d 1 2 3 or     d 1-3
  1086	
  1087	To delete all messages, type   d*
  1088	
  1089	After deleting messages, press    q     (for quit).  If you press "x" 
  1090	(for exit) instead of "q", the messages are not deleted.  They remain 
  1091	in the mailbox and reappear at the next mail check.
  1092	
  1093	Note:  If you'd like to empty your entire mailbox, at the Ok: 
  1094	prompt type    !rm mbox    All messages that were in the mailbox are 
  1095	then gone for good.
  1096	
  1097	
  1098	SENDING MAIL
  1099	
  1100	
  1101	To send mail, type     mail userid <cr>     at the OK: or Respond or 
  1102	pass? prompts.  Example:  mail mrc <cr>   
  1103	
  1104	
  1105	You'll see:
  1106	
  1107	   Use "." or ^D to end.
  1108	   1:
  1109	
  1110	The number and colon (1:) is the prompt for you to write a line of 
  1111	text.  Type no more than 70 characters to a line and finish each line 
  1112	with a <cr> just as you would with a typewriter. When you've finished 
  1113	typing your mail, press Control-D, or type a period by itself at the 
  1114	beginning of a line and press <cr>.  You'll see:
  1115	
  1116	   Edit command (? for help): 
  1117	
  1118	Type     s      for send.
  1119	
  1120	You'll see:
  1121	
  1122	
  1123	   Mail sent.
  1124	   Another recipient (or <return>)?
  1125	
  1126	If you want to send the same mail to another recipient, enter 
  1127	their userid here and press <cr>.
  1128	
  1129	Suggestion:    If you want to make sure The WELL delivered the 
  1130	               message, send the message to your own userid as well.  
  1131	               (The WELL's mail system cannot tell you if the 
  1132	               recipient has read the mail you sent.)
  1133	
  1134	
  1135	SENDING MAIL WITH HEADERS
  1136	
  1137	You can send mail with subject (Subject:) or copy (Cc:) headers, 
  1138	or even "blind" copies.
  1139	
  1140	To do this, at any line number prompt while you're writing your 
  1141	letter, do the following:
  1142	
  1143	     o    To type a subject header, type    ~s    
  1144	
  1145	          (The "~" is the tilde character).
  1146	
  1147	          Then, on the same line, type the subject of the letter.  
  1148	          Press <cr> and begin (or continue) the text of the 
  1149	          letter on the next line.
  1150	
  1151	     o    To send a "carbon" copy, type     ~c
  1152	
  1153	          Then, on the same line, type the userid of the person 
  1154	          you want to receive a copy.  All other recipients will 
  1155	          see that the person received a copy.
  1156	
  1157	     o    To send a "blind" copy, type      ~b
  1158	
  1159	          Then, on the same line, type the userid of the person 
  1160	          you want to receive a blind copy.  No other recipients 
  1161	          will know the person received a copy.
  1162	
  1163	
  1164	
  1165	
  1166	
  1167	FINDING OUT SOMEONE'S USERID
  1168	
  1169	You must use a person's exact userid when sending mail. To find 
  1170	out an individual's userid, type     !finger <lastname>     or   
  1171	!finger <firstname>    at any Ok: prompt.
  1172	
  1173	Examples:   !finger sullivan   or   !finger aaron
  1174	
  1175	
  1176	IF YOU SEND MAIL TO A NON-PERSON
  1177	
  1178	If you mail a message to a non-existent userid, you'll see:
  1179	
  1180	   Ok:<baduserid>...User unknown
  1181	   You have more mail
  1182	   Ok:
  1183	
  1184	Type:  mail
  1185	
  1186	You'll see information something like this:
  1187	
  1188	      >N 1 MAILER-DAEMON [date] "Returned mail: User unknown"
  1189	      &
  1190	
  1191	Type:   d          to delete the mail
  1192	        
  1193	To mail a returned letter to the correct address (or to forward 
  1194	any letter you've just read), type     m correctuserid.  Then, at 
  1195	the line number prompt, type    ~f <cr>    You can then continue 
  1196	writing or end your letter in the usual way.
  1197	
  1198	
  1199	SEEING MAIL THAT'S BEEN STORED IN YOUR MAILBOX
  1200	
  1201	When you read mail and don't delete it, that mail is stored in your 
  1202	mailbox (called "mbox" in your personal directory).  To see 
  1203	stored mail, type    !mail -f    
  1204	
  1205	You can then read the mail in the normal way by requesting specific 
  1206	message numbers (Example: p 3) or by simply pressing <cr> to see the 
  1207	next message.
  1208	
  1209	MAKING YOUR MAILBOX PRIVATE
  1210	
  1211	When you first join The WELL, your private mailbox (a file called 
  1212	"mbox") is open to anyone on The WELL.  To make it private so 
  1213	that only you and the system operator have access to it (and the 
  1214	system operator has other things to do), at the Ok: prompt
  1215	type     !chmod go-rwx mbox
  1216	
  1217	
  1218	SENDING MAIL YOU'VE ALREADY PREPARED WITH A WORD PROCESSOR
  1219	
  1220	You can upload prepared text into a letter.  You'll need to know 
  1221	the uploading procedure for your particular communications 
  1222	software.
  1223	
  1224	1.   First, after using the    mail userid   command, write your 
  1225	     introductory message, if any.  Then, on a line by itself, press     
  1226	     ^D.
  1227	
  1228	2.   At the edit prompt, type    u <cr>    (u is for upload)
  1229	
  1230	3.   You'll now be in edit mode without line numbers.  Upload 
  1231	     your file according to your software instructions. When 
  1232	     the file is finished uploading, press ^D.
  1233	
  1234	4. At the edit prompt, type   s <cr>   as you normally would to 
  1235	   send mail. 
  1236	
  1237	
  1238	Remember that different word processors use different control 
  1239	characters for formatting.  Before you upload your text, make sure 
  1240	you've printed it to disk or used a "strip" program to remove all 
  1241	control characters and limited it to ASCII characters.  
  1242	
  1243	For more information on ASCII characters and other esoterica, see your 
  1244	communications software manual.
  1245	
  1246	NOTE:  To read a file from your WELL directory into a message, 
  1247	at the beginning of a line, type    ~r <filename> <cr>
  1248	  
  1249	     Example:   ~r resume
  1250	
  1251	
  1252	SECRET MAIL
  1253	
  1254	This is just like "mail" but no one can read the messages except the 
  1255	intended recipient.
  1256	
  1257	To use secret mail:
  1258	
  1259	Type     !enroll    at the Ok: prompt.  You'll see instructions 
  1260	"Gimme key".  This asks for a password (key) that you must 
  1261	subsequently quote in order to receive secret mail.
  1262	
  1263	To send secret mail type:    !xsend    followed by a userid in the 
  1264	same manner as the ordinary mail command. (You can send secret mail to 
  1265	only one userid).  Example:    !xsend mrc
  1266	
  1267	To receive secret mail:
  1268	
  1269	If there is secret mail for you, you'll see a message that you 
  1270	have mail.  When you ask to see the mail, you'll be told it's 
  1271	secret. Type          !xget      Give your password when asked, 
  1272	and you'll then see your secret mail.
  1273

  1317	                              CHAT
  1318	
  1319	
  1320	Chat lets you talk with another person who is logged on to the 
  1321	system at the same time you are.  
  1322	
  1323	
  1324	To find out who is currently logged on to The WELL, type     !u     
  1325	at the Ok: prompt.  You'll see a list of all currently logged 
  1326	users.
  1327	
  1328	To chat with another user, type     chat userid   at the Ok: prompt.  
  1329	Example:      chat mrc
  1330	
  1331	If the person has not blocked the chat command (by previously typing    
  1332	set nochat     at the Ok: prompt), they'll hear a beep and see a 
  1333	message that you're contacting them, and you'll be put into the chat 
  1334	mode.  Every line you type is then sent to that person's terminal.  
  1335	
  1336	When you want to stop chatting, press Control-D.
  1337	
  1338	
  1339	IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO CHAT WITH YOU

  1345	along with a beep, and you want to chat with the person, type a 
  1346	Control-C to stop what you're doing.  Then, at the Ok: or Respond 
  1347	or pass? prompts, type    chat <who>         <who> is the userid 
  1348	of the person who wants to chat with you.
  1349	
  1350	If you don't want to chat with other people, type     set nochat    at

  1352	they try to chat with you.
  1353	
  1354	SEND
  1355	
  1356	Some people consider "chat" a little abrupt.  Another way of 
  1357	immediately contacting someone is with the "!send" command.  
  1358	
  1359	Type  !send userid <cr>     then write the message you want to send 
  1360	them as you would with mail.  The addressee will receive the full 
  1361	message immediately rather than just notification that you want 
  1362	to talk to them.  They can reply at their convenience.
  1363	
  1364	
  1365	HOW ONE CHATTER KNOWS WHEN THE OTHER CHATTER IS FINISHED

  1368	itself on a new line and press <cr>.  This corresponds to "over" (as 
  1369	in radio talk) and the other person will know it is their turn to make 
  1370	a remark.
  1371	
  1372	At the end of your last remark in a conversation, type     oo     by 
  1373	itself on a new line, as in "over and out", and press <cr>.  Then 
  1374	press Control-D and you'll leave "chat mode" and return to the

  1472	
  1473	
  1474	The following procedure shows how to edit on The WELL.  We'll use 
  1475	the example of creating and editing a new file, but the procedure 
  1476	works also with mail, and entering and responding to topics.

  1490	period on a line by itself and pressing <cr>, or simply by pressing 
  1491	Control-D.  It also shows that you are ready to enter text on line 
  1492	number 1 of the file you are creating.

  1495	characters or so. Your screen will look something like this:
  1496	
  1497	    Use "." or ^D to end.

  1584	
  1585	
  1586	UPLOADING AND DOWNLOADING FILES WITH XMODEM
  1587	
  1588	XModem is an error-checking procedure for transmitting files to 
  1589	and from The WELL.  It can be used for binary file transfer as 
  1590	well as text files.  
  1591	
  1592	NOTE:  It's easiest to download files from a conference that is 
  1593	using the "lib" function (such as Amiga, Kaypro, Atari, Computer 
  1594	Books, etc.)  You can also download text files by having The WELL 
  1595	display them on your screen while you have a session or capture 
  1596	file going.
  1597	
  1598	CP/M NOTE:  The xmodem function of The WELL does checksum, not 
  1599	CRC, file transfers.  You may have to check your modem software 
  1600	to see if it can handle checksum (the older of the two 
  1601	protocols.)
  1602	
  1603	The command to transfer a file using xmodem looks like this:
  1604	
  1605	     !xm [rRsS] filename
  1606	
  1607	"filename" is the full pathname of the file.  You use this and 
  1608	one of the [rRsS] commands.
  1609	
  1610	Lowercase r or s refers to text files
  1611	
  1612	Uppercase r or s refers to program (binary) files
  1613	
  1614	r or R stands for receive (The WELL receives a file from you)
  1615	
  1616	s or S stands for send (The WELL sends a file to you)
  1617	
  1618	
  1619	     NOTE:  You can learn more about this function by typing  
  1620	     !man xm   at the Ok: prompt.
  1621	
  1622	
  1623	Examples:  
  1624	
  1625	          To download a file named zzz.bin which has been stored 
  1626	          in the directory of public domain Commodore 64 files, 
  1627	          type the following:    
  1628	
  1629	            !xm S /well/publicdomain/c64/zzz.bin 
  1630	
  1631	          To upload a text file named "reviews.txt" into the same 
  1632	          directory, type:   
  1633	     
  1634	            !xm r /well/publicdomain/c64/bforth/reviews.txt
  1635	
  1636	
  1637	
  1638	                         OTHER NETWORKS
  1639	
  1640	
  1641	USENET (Users' Network) is a bulletin board shared among many 
  1642	computer systems around the world.  These systems exchange 
  1643	messages on a regular basis about a variety of subjects.  The 
  1644	best way to learn to use USENET is to go to the Entry Conference 
  1645	on The WELL (type   go entry   at any Ok: prompt).
  1646	
  1647	At the Ok: prompt in the Entry conference, type    s 19
  1648	
  1649	You'll then see information on how to use USENET.
  1650	
  1651	
  1652	UUCP
  1653	
  1654	UUCP (UNIX-to-UNIX Communication Protocol) is a network of UNIX-based 
  1655	computers in the United States and other countries.  The WELL's VAX 
  1656	computer is in regular contact with other members of the network so 
  1657	that messages can be sent literally throughout the world.
  1658	
  1659	To send a message to someone on the UUCP network, you first need 
  1660	to know their particular network and userid.  You'll have to find 
  1661	that out from them.
  1662	
  1663	To find the "path" from The WELL to their network, at the Ok: 
  1664	prompt, type   !look theirnetworkname /well/news/lib/paths <cr>
  1665	
  1666	Suppose your friend's userid is "uriel" and the network your 
  1667	friend is on at work is "westlabs".  To find the path, type
  1668	    
  1669	    !look westlabs /well/news/lib/paths <cr>
  1670	
  1671	You might see something like this:
  1672	    
  1673	    westlabs  sun!meta!westlabs!%s
  1674	
  1675	So to send a message to your friend, at the Ok: prompt you type, 
  1676	
  1677	    !mail sun\!meta\!westlabs\!uriel    
  1678	
  1679	NOTE: Make sure you include the backslashes.  It won't work 
  1680	without them.

  1983	
  1984	
  1985	Warning:  Information in the following section is not presented 
  1986	          in as much detail as the previous area of the manual.  
  1987	          You do not need to know or use any of the Advanced 
  1988	          Features to use The WELL.
  1989	
  1990	          We assume that if you're interested in the Advanced 
  1991	          Features, you're probably an experienced enough 
  1992	          computer user to be able to figure out how they work.  
  1993	          If not, the Help Conference is an excellent place to ask 
  1994	          questions about this or any other material concerning 
  1995	          The WELL.

  1999	MAKING YOUR OWN AUTOMATIC CONFERENCE SCANNER (.cflist)
  2000	
  2001	When you have a .cflist, each time you visit The WELL you're 
  2002	automatically led, in the order you indicate, through the 
  2003	conferences you list in the file.
  2004	
  2005	To create this file, type      listadd  at the Ok: prompt.  
  2006	
  2007	You'll see:
  2008	
  2009	     Which conference would you like to add to your list?
  2010	
  2011	Type the name of the conference you want to add to the list, and press 
  2012	<cr>.
  2013	
  2014	You can also remove a name from your conference list by typing
  2015	    listrm
  2016	
  2017	To add or move a name to the top of the list, type    listtop
  2018	
  2019	Each time you change the list, you end up back at the Ok: prompt.  
  2020	Next time you log in you'll be shown those conferences in that order.  
  2021	When you finish with each conference, type     n      (for "next" at 
  2022	the Ok: prompt).  You'll automatically move to the next conference on 
  2023	your list.
  2024	
  2025	To see this list at any time, at the Ok: prompt type   
  2026	      cat .cflist
  2027	
  2028	Once you've created your .cflist file, to see a list of all the 
  2029	conferences you specified in your file which have new topics, type      
  2030	       check    at the Ok: prompt.
  2031	
  2032	An asterisk indicates which conference you entered first, and an arrow 
  2033	indicates which conference you're currently in.
  2034	
  2035	Note:  You can also put check in the .cfonce file in your directory 
  2036	(see separate listing in this manual) and have it execute every time 
  2037	you log on.  Do not put check in your .cfrc file (another one 
  2038	discussed elsewhere in this manual) or you'll get a listing every time 
  2039	you move to another conference.
  2040	
  2041	
  2042	USING A .profile FILE
  2043	
  2044	The .profile file performs certain useful functions for you every time 
  2045	you log on to the WELL.  It was created for you by the WELL system 
  2046	administration when you first got your userid.  
  2047	
  2048	You may want to add things to this file for specific purposes, 
  2049	such as automatically controlling text scrolling, but you should 
  2050	be careful not to remove this file, or change anything that was 
  2051	put there by the system administrator (unless you're absolutely 
  2052	sure you know what you're doing). 
  2053	
  2054	
  2055	The profile file initially "belongs" to the system administrator.  To 
  2056	take control of it yourself, do the following:
  2057	
  2058	Type    !cp .profile temp
  2059	        !rm -f .profile
  2060	        !mv temp .profile
  2061	
  2062	which translates to: 1) make a copy of the .profile file, 2) 
  2063	remove the old one, (the -f eliminates a query from rm about the 
  2064	fact that you don't own the file), and 3) rename your temporary 
  2065	file to .profile.
  2066	
  2067	
  2068	
  2069	USING A .cfonce FILE
  2070	
  2071	A .cfonce file is an optional file you can create to execute some 
  2072	commands once The WELL boots up.  Use this for some things you 
  2073	want done only once.  If you want certain things done each time 
  2074	you enter a new conference, put those commands in your .cfrc file 
  2075	(next section).
  2076	
  2077	For example, this is where you would put     check     so that as 
  2078	soon as you log on to The WELL, you can see which conferences 
  2079	have new items.
  2080	
  2081	
  2082	USING A .cfrc FILE
  2083	
  2084	A .cfrc file is a file that executes commands every time you go to a 
  2085	new conference.  
  2086	
  2087	For example, if you put "see" in your own .cfrc file, every time you 
  2088	go to a new conference, you'll automatically be shown everything new 
  2089	without having to type "see" every time.
  2090	
  2091	You can also:
  2092	
  2093	define your own editor
  2094	set "date" in response and topic headers on and off
  2095	define your own pager
  2096	define how topic and response headers will look to you
  2097	define how prompts will look to you
  2098	define your own Picospan and Unix command macros
  2099	automatically execute Picospan commands
  2100	set usrid on (this makes it possible to always know who is really 
  2101	              entering a pseudononymous response)
  2102	and lots of other stuff.
  2103	
  2104	
  2105	CHANGING HOW A PROMPT APPEARS
  2106	
  2107	You have the option of changing how the Ok: prompt appears to you (and 
  2108	only to you).  
  2109	
  2110	At the Ok: prompt, type       define prompt "newprompt"      (make 
  2111	sure the new prompt is in quotation marks).  You'll get that new 
  2112	prompt for the duration of the session.
  2113	
  2114	Note:  To define a prompt continually, place it in your .cfonce file.
  2115	
  2116	Any time you want to again use OK: as the prompt,  type     
  2117	    define prompt      (with no new prompt specified).   This returns 
  2118	to the default, which is "Ok:".
  2119	
  2120	
  2121	
  2122	MOVING FILES AROUND
  2123	
  2124	
  2125	You have your own private directory on The WELL.  To see its name, at 
  2126	the Ok: prompt,  type     pwd     (for "present working directory").
  2127	
  2128	To upload a file into this directory, at Ok:, 
  2129	type     cat > <filename>        
  2130	
  2131	Finish uploading by pressing Control-D.  At the first > prompt, 
  2132	type      :read <filename>      to read the file you uploaded.   
  2133	
  2134	
  2135	
  2136	SEEING WHAT'S IN YOUR PRIVATE FILE DIRECTORY
  2137	
  2138	
  2139	At OK?  or Respond or Pass?, type      ls -al     to list all 
  2140	files in the current directory. 
  2141	
  2142	The numbers you see will be the size of each file.  This is 
  2143	useful in seeing which files to remove if you don't want to be 
  2144	charged by The WELL for excess storage space.  
  2145	
  2146	
  2147	
  2148	Type    cat filename     or      type filename    to read a text file.
  2149	
  2150	Type    ed filename      to edit a file
  2151	
  2152	Type    !rm filename     to remove a file
  2153	
  2154	
  2155	PLACING RESTRICTIONS ON FILES YOU'VE CREATED
  2156	
  2157	You can determine what other users can do with files that you've 
  2158	created.  To do this, use the "chmod" command.
  2159	
  2160	First, to see what users are currently allowed to do with the 
  2161	file,  type      files -l <filename>      
  2162	
  2163	   Example:    files -l manual
  2164	
  2165	You'll see something like:
  2166	
  2167	        -rw-r--r--  1 mick        84312 May  4 1986  manual
  2168	
  2169	
  2170	EXPLANATION:
  2171	
  2172	   -rw-r--r--  1 mick        84312 May  4 1986  manual
  2173	   123456789x
  2174	
  2175	   1 is normally a hyphen for most files ("d" if a directory)
  2176	   2,3,4 are user permissions (2=read, 3=write, 4=execute)
  2177	   5,6,7 are group permissions (5=read, 6=write, 7=execute)
  2178	   8,9,x are "all others" permissions (8=read, 9=write, x=execute)
  2179	
  2180	So for the file named "manual", the user (mick) can read the file 
  2181	and write to (change) the file.  Everyone else can only read the 
  2182	file.
  2183	
  2184	To have other users not be able to change a file, type    
  2185	   !chmod go -w <filename>
  2186	
  2187	Note:  !chmod +w <filename> will again let all users write to the 
  2188	                            file
  2189	
  2190	
  2191	The full form for this is:
  2192	
  2193	    !chmod who opcodepermission <filename>
  2194	
  2195	who:  u    user 
  2196	      g    group
  2197	      o    all others
  2198	      a    all (default)
  2199	
  2200	opcode:     +   add permission of files
  2201	            -   remove permission of files
  2202	            =   assign absolute permission for file
  2203	
  2204	permissions:  r    read
  2205	              w    write
  2206	              x    execute
  2207	
  2208	!chmod go-r payroll_data  
  2209	
  2210	Now no one else except the user can read the file named 
  2211	"payroll_data".
  2212	
  2213	
  2214	For full online information on permissions, at the Ok: prompt 
  2215	type    !man chmod
  2216	
  2217

  2258	responses made to each topic, and the last time you saw the topic, 
  2259	type     display seen     at the conference Ok: prompt.
  2260	
  2261	
  2262	LAST
  2263	
  2264	!last   shows you who has called into the system recently.  It 
  2265	lists userid, port#, and date and time of last access.  To see 
  2266	the last times a particular user logged on to The WELL, type    
  2267	   !last userid   
  2268	
  2269	To see a specific number of times, for example the last two times 
  2270	a user was on, type   !last -2 userid

  2273	PRINT
  2274	
  2275	
  2276	Type:  print
  2277	
  2278	This command works much like read, except it automatically bypasses 
  2279	the Respond or pass? prompt.  It also starts each new topic at the top 
  2280	of a page.  If you don't want to read an entire topic, press Control-
  2281	C.
  2282	
  2283	
  2284	SET
  2285	
  2286	(As a shortcut you only need to type those letters indicated here 
  2287	in uppercase)
  2288	
  2289	Type:    set [option]    where [option] is one of the following:
  2290	
  2291	Example:  set nochat    or    set noch

  2298	DOT,NODOT               otherwise, will period end text mode, or just ^D      
  2299	                        only?
  2300	EDalways,NOEDalways     will I go directly to the editor upon text            
  2301	                        entry (respond, enter, mail)?
  2302	MAiltext, NOMAiltext    let the send mail program collect text                
  2303	                        instead of us
  2304	MEto,NOMEto             will I see my responses as "new" after someone        
  2305	                        else responses?
  2306	NAme, USer              change your name in the current conference
  2307	NEWResponses,RELoad     reload participation file, forgetting what            
  2308	                        I've seen in this conference since the last 
  2309	                        session
  2310	NODEfault, DEFAULT      join the default conference when starting             
  2311	                        up.  Only useful in a .cfonce file
  2312	NUmbered,NONUmbered,
  2313	UNNumbered              number, don't number text in responses
  2314	PAssword, PAsswd        change your Unix password
  2315	RELOAD                  set reload  at the Ok: prompt works as a 
  2316	                        conference-wide "new".  
  2317	
  2318	                        If, for example, you have viewed a number of 
  2319	                        new entries in a conference and you want to 
  2320	                        see a response again but you didn't know 
  2321	                        where it was, just set reload and everything 
  2322	                        you just saw will be new again.  
  2323	
  2324	RESIGN                  zap my participation file and leave me an 
  2325	                        observer
  2326	STrip,NOSTrip           The WELL will (won't) strip control 
  2327	                        characters out of text typed in
  2328	STAy, NOSTAy            should RFP stay on current topic after a 
  2329	                        response is made?
  2330	UID, NOUid              do (don't) display uids on responses
  2331	
  2332	
  2333	
  2334	UNIX
  2335	
  2336	To exit from The WELL to the Unix system, 
  2337	
  2338	type    unix         
  2339	
  2340	
  2341	
  2342	You can give a Unix command from the Ok: prompt.  
  2343	Type    !unix-command    (Example:  !finger tkr)
  2344	
  2345	
  2346	You can use Unix to upload and download files, access C and other 
  2347	languages, access word processors, and so on.  Exit Unix with a 
  2348	Control-D or return to the conferences by typing    bbs

  2354	
  2355	
  2356	
  2357	DEFINING MACROS      
  2358	
  2359	
  2360	A macro is a shortcut -- a short command which causes a longer 
  2361	series of commands to take place.
  2362	
  2363	Type  define                      display current macros
  2364	      define name                 remove name from macro table
  2365	      define name "string"        define a variable
  2366	      define name mask "string"   define a command
  2367	
  2368	The form of this command is;
  2369	
  2370	define <name> <mask> <list of commands>
  2371	
  2372	<name> = whatever combinations of letters numbers or whatever you use 
  2373	here will be what you type at the Ok: prompt to execute the specified 
  2374	command
  2375	
  2376	<mask> - can be one of the following;
  2377	
  2378	1 - for command macros which will work at the Ok: prompt
  2379	2 - for variables
  2380	4 - for command parameters (such as topic ranges)
  2381	8 - for command macros which will work at the Respond or pass? prompt
  2382	
  2383	or combinations of the above, such as;
  2384	
  2385	9 - for commands that will work at both the Ok: and the Respond or 
  2386	pass? prompt  (8 + 1 = 9)
  2387	
  2388	<list of commands> - this is whatever command you want executed
  2389	
  2390	Examples:  
  2391	
  2392	define haha 9 "join jokes"
  2393	
  2394	when you type haha at either the Ok: or Respond or pass? prompt, the 
  2395	command join jokes is executed.  The "mask" 9 is used so the macro 
  2396	will work at both prompts.  The command "join jokes" must be in quote 
  2397	marks.
  2398	
  2399	define toc 9 "browse all short"
  2400	
  2401	Typing the macro name "toc" at either the Ok: or Respond or pass? 
  2402	prompt will execute the command, browse all short.
  2403	
  2404	define copytext 9 "cat /usr/guest/plum/pudding"
  2405	
  2406	Typing the word "copytext" at either the Ok: or Respond or pass? 
  2407	prompt will copy a file named "pudding" located in the home directory 
  2408	of /usr/guest/plum.
  2409	
  2410	 
  2411	
  2412	CREATING A MACRO WHICH LETS YOU SEE WHICH CONFERENCES YOU 
  2413	HAVEN'T VISITED LATELY
  2414	
  2415	
  2416	At Ok:, type define oldest 9 "ls -ltr .*.cf*"
  2417	
  2418	Now when you type oldest, you'll see when you last visited all 
  2419	conferences on The WELL in reverse order, so that the conference 
  2420	you've been away from the longest will be at the top of the list.
  2421	
  2422	To have this available at all times, define the macro in your .cfrc 
  2423	file.
