     2		    DOS 2.0 HAS PROBLEMS WITH REDIRECTION OF I/O
     3	
     4	     There  are  problems  in  DOS  2.0 with the redirection of I/O and
     5	 piping for programs that use the original  DOS  1.1  INT  21  function
     6	 calls	for  input.   This  problem  is  readily apparent to users of C
     7	 language packages such as Computer  Innovation  C-86,	Lattice  C,  or
     8	 Microsoft  C  (you'd  think  they  would  get it right!).  One problem
     9	 is that all output to the screen is redirected,  even	keyboard  echo.
    10	 Correct  operation  would  redirect  all program output for the screen
    11	 (stdout) to the specified >file, but the echo of keyboard input  would
    12	 still	be  sent  to  the  screen.  Instead, both the keyboard echo and
    13	 the program output are sent to the redirected	>file.	 Thus,	if  you
    14	 run  programs	such as the CAT.C (K&R,page 154) example that Microsoft
    15	 distributes with their C; or COPYIO.C (K&R,page 15)  with  the  output
    16	 redirected to a file, you will get the following results:
    17	
    18	      1.   Under  DOS  1.1, keyboard input is echoed to the screen
    19	      as you type and each line  appears  in  the  >file  once	as
    20	      expected.
    21	
    22	      2.   Under  DOS  2.0,  keyboard  input  is not echoed to the
    23	      screen, but each line appears in the >file twice!
    24	
    25	     This situation is handled correctly in DOS  2.0  if  the  new  INT
    26	 21  function call 3F is used.	This can be demonstrated by redirecting
    27	 output for the DOS 2.0 function MORE - it works as desired.
    28	
    29	     The redirecting of input to these programs doesn't  work  properly
    30	 either.   If  the  file  has  not been edited with debug to end with a
    31	 control-Z, the program will hang up at the end  of  the  <input  file.
    32	 You  must reboot the system to continue!  Also, if you pipe the output
    33	 of the first program into a second  program,  the  final  output  will
    34	 contain  each	line  four times, doubled spaced after the second line!
    35	 These problems do not occur for programs that	use  the  new  DOS  2.0
    36	 calls for I/O, such as SORT and MORE.
    37	
    38	     The  question  now  is  how  do  you fixup C programs to run under
    39	 DOS 2.0 and not redirect keyboard echo to the stdout file?  The easiest
    40	 way for C compilers that include their  own  redirection  code  is  to
    41	 change their redirection symbols from <, >, and >> to something else. Then
    42	 DOS  2.0  won't  do  the redirection, so the C code will be able to do
    43	 it correctly.	With the Microsoft C compiler, this is easily accomplished
    44	 by modifying three lines of code in _MAIN.C.	A  good  choice  is  to
    45	 modify  _MAIN.C  so  that  it	redirects  on the symbols {, }, and }}.
    46	 The only restriction is that these symbols then  should  not  be  used
    47	 in  filenames.   With these changes, the user can choose to let either
    48	 DOS  <, >, >>	or C  {, },  }}   do  the  redirecting.   The  modified
    49	 version  of  _MAIN.C  is compiled to obtain a new _MAIN.OBJ, which can
    50	 either be put into the library MC.LIB to replace  the	original  _MAIN
    51	 by  using  the  LIB.EXE  utility,  i.e.     LIB   MC.LIB  -_MAIN+_MAIN
    52	 or it can be kept separate.  If kept  separate,  remember  to	include
    53	 it  in  the  list  of	.OBJ  files  specified	in  the LINK call, i.e.
    54	 LINK c _main myprogram.
    55	
    56	     The three lines to change in Microsoft C's  _MAIN are:
    57		  case '{':
    58		  case '}':
    59		  if (*line == '}')
