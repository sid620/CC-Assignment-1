     1	HOW TO INSTALL 1MB CHIP INTO AN AMIGA 500 ON THE MOTHERCARD!
     2	
     3	Note. This hack works just on Rev. 6A Amigas (or higher!)
     4	
     5	You will need the following:
     6	
     7	                  4 memory chips (44267 or pincompatible)
     8	                  A LOW WATTAGE solder iron
     9	
    10	PLEASE READ ALL TEXT CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU DOES ANYTHING!
    11	
    12	Now open you Amiga (it's a hell to open those fucking nonstandard screws!)
    13	(When you open Ya Amiga ya worrenty will go to hell, but if ya are a real
    14	hardware hacker you don't mind!!) then try to find where the memory chips
    15	are located! (under the keyboard on the left side where the memory expansion
    16	should be located!) there will you find 4 EMPTY places for 4 chips! just
    17	solder the new chips there! (with the SAME direction as the other chips
    18	already have otherwise bad things CAN happen!)
    19	Now locate jumper   JP7A  and cut the connections from ALL three bases!
    20	then find jumper JP2 and cut the connections and solder a connection
    21	between the middle one and that one on the top!    so the jumpers should
    22	be connected like this:
    23	
    24	JP7A:
    25	      O
    26	
    27	      O
    28	
    29	      O
    30	
    31	 (no connection at all!)
    32	
    33	
    34	JP2:
    35	
    36	      O
    37	      |
    38	      O
    39	
    40	      O
    41	
    42	 (The Top one and the middle one soldered together!)
    43	
    44	
    45	
    46	and that should be it! (test the command AVAIL to check how much CHIP/FAST
    47	mem you have! you should now have 104000 or something like that in CHIP
    48	mem! (if you have downloaded ths from a BBS that was packed with LHARC by
    49	me then AVAIL will be in this file too!)
    50	
    51	
    52	
    53	NOTE: YOU CAN'T HAVE A MEMORY EXPANSION (LIKE THE A501) IN THE INTERNAL
    54	PORT IF YOU INSTALL THIS MEMORY!!!!!!!!! IT GOT TO BE A EXTERNAL MEMORY
    55	EXPANSION!!!!!!!!!
    56	
    57	I WILL NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG FOR YOU!
    58	                ===
    59	
    60	If you have something to ask me feel free to call those BBSes and leave a
    61	message to me:  (Send the messy to John Hertell)
    62	
    63	The Golden Arrow    +46 26 275710 (-2400 BAUD) (I'm a CO-SYSOP there!)
    64	Checkpoint Charlie  +46 31 463582 (HST+)
    65	Power Station       +46 522 29360 (HST+)
    66	
    67	Or in VIDEOTEX in Sweden send a message to: 52000161-1
    68	
    69	or call my voice line on +46 522 75764
    70	or a letter to: John Hertell, Box 5074, 451 05 Uddevalla, Sweden
    71	
    72	Have fun with your 1MB CHIP AMIGA! (on the motherboard)
    73	
    74	AGAIN i must say that this hack ONLY works if you have a REV. 6 AMIGA!
    75	(they have a SUPER FAT AGNUS already!)    The Superfat Agnus is called:
    76	8372A! (it's that strange chip who looks like a box!)
