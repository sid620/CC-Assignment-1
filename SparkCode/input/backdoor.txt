     8	This is  BACKDOR1.arc   ... the first in a series of 
     9	"back doors" to various games.  The source of this info is
    10	various magazines, and I have paraphrased the articles.
    11	
    12	Note that "back door" refers NOT to regular game hints on
    13	how to play better, but to a way to CHEAT, usually put
    14	there by the programmer, sometimes caused by a bug.  Usually
    15	you'll be made invincible if it's an arcade-type game, or 
    16	be able to advance quicker if an adventure game. 
    17	
    18	Most of these "back door" and "side door" hints are out of
    19	a GREAT magazine for the Amiga, C64, and C128:  INFO.
    20	It's a grass-roots, down to earth magazine - the first
    21	magazine about personal computers to be be entirely done on
    22	personal computers.  That's "Where It's At".  
    23	
    24	You owe it to yourself to subscribe to INFO.
    25	With the exception of most of the ads, everything including
    26	color screen shots and photos are digitally created, edited,
    27	composed, printed, and color separated as complete assembled
    28	pages on 14 Amiga computers running Professional Page (and
    29	many many other Amiga software products), and output to a
    30	Linotronic L300 typesetting device at 1235 dots per inch!
    31	INFO doesn't cover programming techniques, but in my opinion
    32	it out-shines all the other Commodore mags for news, honest
    33	opinion, game reviews, and reviews of all C= software.

    38	
    39	ALL GAMES:  connect a genlock to the Amiga and leave it on
    40	while playing games, and they'll play 25% slower, which
    41	allows you to score high. 
    42	
    43	
    44	
    45	ARKANOID
    46	
    47	Get into the back door this way:  boot and run the game as
    48	usual, then select a start screen and begin game.  Press the
    49	space bar to pause, and type in  DSIMAGIC  (no spaces, and 
    50	don't press Return).  Press the space bar to unpause.
    51	
    52	Now a yellow Power capsule named  DS  will fall down.  Catch
    53	it.  Now you can get any power capsule you want any time.
    54	Press the first letter of the capsule you want, and it will
    55	fall down for you to catch: 
    56	  Break  Catch  Disruption  Expand  Laser  Player  Slow
    57	Catch some Player capsules first to get extra lives.
    58	
    59	You can also use two capsules at the same time, like Disrupt
    60	the ball into three balls, and use Lasers also.
    61	
    62	Pressing the  F  key will send you to the Finsl screen where
    63	you fight DOH, the Dominion Over Hour monster on the cover
    64	 of the package.  You'll need lots of lives first.
    65	
    66	Skip over any screen by pressing  Enter  on the keypad, or 
    67	get through the screen fast (with points too) using a Break
    68	capsule.
    69	
    70	
    71	
    72	ARKANOID II
    73	
    74	On the high score screen, type in the name  DEBBIE S  
    75	(with the space), and you'll have infinite lives.  
    76	
    77	
    78	
    79	BARBARIAN
    80	
    81	Boot and run the game as usual, but at some point after the
    82	game has started, type in:  04-08-59   ...It will make the
    83	Barbarian character almost invincible, but he can still be
    84	killed by very high falls, and by the flame-hurling horned
    85	demon in the dungeon deep, pictured on the cover.
    86	
    87	After you type  04-08-59  the screen will turn gray, telling
    88	you that you're invincible.
    89	
    90	Once you make it to Necron, you must have a shield.  Face 
    91	Necron when he turns to face you.  When he throws a fireball
    92	at you, press the defense button as it hits your shield.
    93	
    94	
    95	
    96	BARD'S TALE
    97	
    98	How to hoard millions in gold without trying:  Load your
    99	party, go to the stats screen for the first player.  Pool
   100	all of the party's gold to the first player, then remove
   101	him from the party, then load him back in.  Then pool the
   102	gold to another player.  Repeat this for each player.
   103	
   104	Then turn off the computer without saving the game.  Reboot
   105	and ezch player will have gold equal to the TOTAL the party
   106	had before.  Repeat if you're really greedy !
   107	
   108	
   109	
   110	BETTER DEAD THAN ALIEN
   111	
   112	If you are just about to be hit by an alien or a bomb, press
   113	the ESC key to pause, move your ship out of the way, then
   114	press  N  to resume the action.
   115	
   116	Type  CHAMP  on the options screen, then press the  HELP
   117	key.  You'll be shown a list of cheat keys.
   118	
   119	
   120	
   121	CAPONE
   122	
   123	To find the "special bonus", go to the front of the Post
   124	Office.  Shoot the ball at the top of the flag pole, and 
   125	your score will go way up.  If you shoot it again, you'll
   126	see a screen of the programmers!  Shoot again and you'll be
   127	invincible, standing in the bank.  At the end of that round,
   128	you will start at the beginning, except you'll be in warp
   129	speed.
   130	
   131	
   132	
   133	DEFENDER OF THE CROWN
   134	
   135	To get 1,024 Knights:  After conquering a territory, press
   136	these four keys at the same time, while the drive is still 
   137	running:  H J K L  ... If you do it just right, you'll have
   138	1,024 knights both in your home and in your army.  Hey, this
   139	is good stuff!
   140	
   141	Another way was reported in which to get 1,024 Knights, but
   142	it doesn't seem to work:  After first picking the knight,
   143	when Robin Hood appears, type PATTERSON over and over until
   144	the map of England appears.  Don't press the Return key.  
   145	If this trick doesn't work the first time, try again.  
   146	I was only able to get this to work most of the time if,
   147	before typing  PATTERSON  over and over, I first typed in
   148	my name with no spaces:  GEORGEKNOCHEL   Yep, Twilight Zone!
   149	
   150	Another good trick for Defender of the Crown, for sword
   151	fighting, is to get the PD program called FUN-BUT
   152	(fun button), which when run lets you press the F1 key
   153	continuously instead of clicking on the mouse.
   154	(but then this is a hint, not a back door).
   155	
   156	
   157	
   158	DRAGON'S LAIR
   159	
   160	This will demo the ENTIRE game (about 18 minutes worth or a
   161	disk I/O error, whichever comes first).  You can't play it,
   162	just watch the whole game:  After the credits have finished
   163	loading, and are being displayed (the red light will still
   164	be on, but no loading is occurring), press the following six
   165	(6) keys, simultaneously:   <ESC> R / L N 7   
   166	Yes, all at the same time (use your nose if ya have to -
   167	just press ESC and hold, then press R and hold, etc.). 
   168	The screen will flash if you did it right.  THEN PRESS THE
   169	FIRE BUTTON on your joystick.  Sit back and watch all the
   170	animation.  (I couldn't - my disk 5 had an I/O error)
   171	
   172	
   173	
   174	DUNGEON MASTER
   175	
   176	To advance Ninjas a level, stand in a hall and throw all
   177	your weapons, then get them and repeat.  This also works
   178	with magic and Fighter levels:  cast a spell at the air,
   179	or slash and bash until you gain a level.
   180	
   181	
   182	
   183	F/A-18 INTERCEPTOR
   184	
   185	Select option "2 Free Flight, no enemy confrontation" from
   186	the main menu.  Then select zero instead of 1 to 4.  The
   187	screen will go into a spiral and scroll way south to 34 by
   188	117 degrees, placing your plane somewhere without a runway.
   189	To take off you have to use the afterburners.  117 degrees
   190	is the furthest south you'll be able to fly, but you can go
   191	in other directions.  (Is there more to this back door? hmm)
   192	
   193	
   194	
   195	FAERY TALE ADVENTURE
   196	
   197	Sometimes you can accumulate all the treasure you want by
   198	going near the item, press space bar, and keep pressing 'T'.
   199	You'll receive an infinite supply of that treasure.
   200	
   201	Save your position in a dungeon.  Then go through it until
   202	you don't have anymore keys.  Restore your position.  All 
   203	doors already opened will still be open, and you'll have a
   204	new supply of keys.  Repeat if needed.  Also works in cave.
   205	
   206	Jump on the turtle and start slashing.  Your bravery points
   207	will go up to infinity, but doesn't hurt the turtle or you.
   208	
   209	On the island with the Crystal Castle, press the right mouse
   210	button while talking to the Sorceress and your luck will go
   211	to 65.  "Ask"ing the Sorceress several times will normally
   212	boost your luck.
   213	
   214	If running low on green keys, use a secret entrance for the
   215	fort - it is on the left side, almost even with the door.
   216	
   217	
   218	HYBRIS
   219	
   220	Boot game and don't do anything until the high scores screen
   221	appears.  Then type COMMANDER and click the fire button.
   222	When it starts, wait a few moments and press the F10 key.
   223	If the extensions of your ship get flickery or glimmer,
   224	you're now invincible and have unlimited expansions and
   225	smart bombs.  Get to the other 6 levels of expansions by
   226	pressing F1 through F5 when you're in unexpanded mode, or
   227	capture the special "capsules" in the usual way.  Move to 
   228	other game levels (there are three) with the F8 key, and
   229	turn invincibility off or on with the F10 key.  No High
   230	scores are collected when you're invincible.
   231	
   232	
   233	
   234	KARATE KID II
   235	
   236	Press the  P  key in single player mode to be taken to the
   237	next screen.  You can go as far as the Final Encounter.  In
   238	2-player mode, you can go to the next-to-the-last screen.
   239	
   240	
   241	
   242	LEISURE SUIT LARRY
   243	
   244	Press ALT and X at the same time to bypass the proof-of-age
   245	questions.
   246	
   247	
   248	
   249	STARGLIDER  (not Starglider II):
   250	
   251	Boot and play as usual until launched and ready to do
   252	battle.  Then slow down until completely stopped in 
   253	space.  Press the F1 key to turn on the fixed sight, and
   254	press the backspace key to pause the game.  Now type:
   255	    js[space]arg[space]s     You should now be invincible!
   256	You'll know you're in invincible mode when you can
   257	repeatedly press the  P  key and get additional missiles (up
   258	to 9).  If the password didn't take the first time, try
   259	again.  To may have to dock and re-exit for it to work.
   260	Once invincible, your fuel will remain constant and shields
   261	will never be depleted.
   262	
   263	Also, a secret built-in 3D object viewer running in the 
   264	background is available by pressing the  z  key once you've
   265	entered the invincible mode.  Use the keyboard to pause [p],
   266	select [, and .] and manipulate objects - use all keys
   267	except q and ESC.  Use the mouse to change point of view
   268	and magnification and hold down the right button.  ....
   269	
   270	
   271	
   272	STARGLIDER II
   273	
   274	Once the game has started, press  F  for fixed sights and
   275	then slow the ship to a halt.  Press BACKSPACE to pause, and
   276	type the words:  WERE ON A MISSION FROM GOD      (really!)
   277	(The article did not have the apostrophe  '  in We're ...)
   278	
   279	Then press  1  (one) on the keyboard (not keypad).  Your
   280	shield and energy levels will drop to a fixed point.  Press
   281	the letter  K  to get all the weapons in the game, including
   282	the neutron bomb.  If you run low on weapons, you can get
   283	them all back by repeating the process.  Onward into battle,
   284	young soldiers!
   285	
   286	
   287	
   288	SWORD OF SODAN
   289	
   290	Type  NANCY  then press RETURN on the high scores screen for
   291	unlimited lives!
   292	
   293	
   294	
   295	TEST DRIVE
   296	
   297	Holding down the joystick button while going around curves
   298	prevents you from hitting the wall or going off the cliff.
   299	
   300	
   301	
   302	THREE STOOGES
   303	
   304	To really slow down "the hand" which selects the scenes, do
   305	the slapping game and pull Curly's ear: pull it continuously
   306	until the time runs out. 
   307	
   308	
   309	
   310	XENON
   311	
   312	Let yourself be killed off at the beginning of the 2nd stage
   313	of the 2nd level, and all aliens in the round are destroyed.
   314	
   315	
   316	
   317	Press [ENTER] to continue...
   318
