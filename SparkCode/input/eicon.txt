     1	Montreal, Canada February 17, 1992 Eicon Technology today announced
     2	shipment of Access for OS/2 and of its latest version of Access for
     3	Windows 3.11. These are complete 3270 terminal and printer emulation
     4	packages for OS/2 Presentation Manager and Microsoft Windows 3.0.
     5	Standalone or LAN-based PCs can connect to multiple IBM hosts at different
     6	locations to exchange information at the same time as they run other
     7	OS/2-based or Windows-based applications.
     8	
     9	Support for Industry Standard Communications Platforms: Access for Windows
    10	and Access for OS/2 are workstation-resident emulation software. A
    11	workstation running either program can connect to an IBM host and
    12	establish up to 32 simultaneous display and/or printer sessions across
    13	different SNA platforms:
    14	
    15	Access for Windows 
    16	------------------
    17	Eicon Technology SNA Gateway 
    18	Direct Token-Ring 
    19	IBM PC 3270 Emulation 
    20	
    21	Access for OS/2 
    22	---------------
    23	Eicon Technology SNA Gateway 
    24	Direct Token-Ring 
    25	IBM DFT Coax (or compatibles) 
    26	
    27	Unique in the market, Eicon Technology's direct Token-Ring option enables a
    28	single Access workstation to establish connections with up to three
    29	different Token-Ring attached hosts.
    30	
    31	"Access for OS/2 is the most flexible and easy to use OS/2 emulation
    32	product I have seen. Also, Eicon Technology's implementation of the mouse
    33	emulation for the light pen will save Hillcrest Medical thousands of
    34	dollars this year alone", says John Schmidt, Director, Clinical Systems,
    35	of Hillcrest Medical Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
    36	
    37	Enhancements and Features: 
    38	
    39	Enhancements and features include new editing features, new keyboard and
    40	macro functions, and complete Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) support for
    41	display and printer sessions.
    42	
    43	* New editing features provide users with the ability to select the data
    44	format (text or bitmap) for copying from host sessions to GUI-based
    45	applications.
    46	
    47	* Keyboard setup enables users to configure the keyboard for PC AT, 101/102
    48	Enhanced, Keytronic KB 3270 Plus, ICL 122, Toshiba 3200/5200 and others.
    49	Users can also customize their keyboard maps.
    50	
    51	* The numeric keypad to the extreme right can be remapped separately from
    52	the keyboard with 3270 functions, Access for Windows and Access for OS/2
    53	macros and desktop functions (e.g.: File & Open), providing the user with
    54	total keyboard mapping options.
    55	
    56	* Macro facility automatically records a sequence of commands and
    57	keystrokes to a file as it is being performed by the user. To rerun that
    58	same sequence, the user simply calls up the macro. No programming is
    59	required to write the macro.
    60	
    61	* DDE is now supported under printer sessions. Our current DDE support
    62	enables GUI-based applications to automatically retrieve data page-by-page
    63	and examine it before it goes to print. Eight DDE connections per display
    64	session are supported.
    65	
    66	Compatibility: 
    67	
    68	Both Access for Windows and Access for OS/2 present the identical graphical
    69	user interface. Users can run them on the same LAN as Eicon Technology's
    70	DOS emulations with Eicon Technology SNA Gateways or IBM's Token-Ring
    71	connections. The family of Access emulation products offers users a single
    72	solution to meet their 3270 requirements.
