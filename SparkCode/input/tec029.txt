     9	The HP 95LX is palmtop computer that runs under MS-DOS 3.2.  It has 1mb of 
    10	on-board RAM that is configurable between RAM and disk drive.  An example 
    11	would be configuring 256k of this on-board RAM as system RAM and the 
    12	Remaining 768k as the C: drive. There are RAM cards available which vary in 
    13	size from 512k to 1.5mb.  These have their own battery to maintain the data 
    14	and are treated just like floppies.  There is a slot on the left side of the 
    15	HP 95LX which  accepts the cards and is referenced as drive A:. This Note
    16	presents a procedure for "Stacking" this A: RAM card. 
    17	
    18	The 95LX Filer/File Transfer Utility allows file copies, deletes etc.  
    19	It allows you to run applications, gives a shell to the DOS prompt, and 
    20	allows connection between the HP 95LX and serial port on a desktop machine 
    21	which runs a package called the Connectivity Pack.  The Connectivity Pack 
    22	allows you to copy files between the two machines.  This procedure involves 
    23	the use of the Filer and Connectivity Pack, but does not give detailed 
    24	instruction on their use.  Please refer to the 95LX documentation.  
    25	
    26	Note:
    27	There is an external drive made by PAMCO  that can connect to a desktop 
    28	machine via the parallel port that allows a desktop machine to directly 
    29	access the RAM cards for the HP 95LX.  The current device driver for 
    30	these drives is NOT compatible with Stacker.  PAMCO is currently looking 
    31	into this situation.
    32	
    33	PROCEDURE:
    34	
    35	Due to the lack of RAM on the HP 95LX the Stacker Install will not run.
    36	Therefore, a desktop machine is required for part of this procedure.  
    37	
    38	1. On the desktop machine, run Stacker's Install program to personalize
    39	   the files and copy them to the hard drive.  After this is done, escape
    40	   out of Install without creating a drive.
    41	
    42	2. Use the following command to build an empty Stacker drive on the desktop
    43	   machine.
    44	     SCREATE C:\STACVOL.DSK /S=1.5 /R=4.0
    45	
    46	This will create a 1.5mb Stacvol file with an anticipated compression ratio
    47	of 4.0 to 1 to accomodate the high compression ratio of Lotus 1-2-3 files.
    48	(The /S= specifies the size of the RAM card in MBytes. The size may vary
    49	depending on the size of the RAM card. 
    50	
    51	3. Use Sattrib to remove the hidden, system and read-only attributes of
    52	   the Stacvol file with the following command:
    53	       SATTRIB -R -H -S C:\STACVOL.DSK
    54	
    55	4. On the HP 95LX, while in the Filer utility, choose SYSTEM to get
    56	   to a DOS prompt.
    57	
    58	5. Make certain there is no data on the RAM card which should be in drive A:
    59	
    60	6. At the root directory of drive C: on the HP 95LX add the following 
    61	   line to the CONFIG.SYS file: (If a Config.sys does not exist, create
    62	   one by typing:  Copy con Config.sys <Enter>...then add the device 
    63	   line <Enter>...then press <ctrl z> to save the file)
    64	
    65	   DEVICE=C:\STACKER.COM @
    66	
    67	9. Using the Connectivity Pack on the desktop machine and the Filer/File
    68	   transfer utility on the 95 LX, transfer STACKER.COM and SCHECK.EXE to
    69	   the Root directory of the 95LX.  
    70	
    71	10. Transfer STACVOL.DSK from the desktop machine to the RAM card in drive A: 
    72	
    73	11. Re-boot the HP 95LX to load the Stacker device driver.
    74	
    75	12. Mount the A: Stacker drive by typing  STACKER A   at the
    76	    DOS prompt.  Conversely, you may unmount by typing STACKER -A .
    77	    You may want to create batch files including these commands so the
    78	    Stacker drives may be mounted and unmounted directly from the Filer.
