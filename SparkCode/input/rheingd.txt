    11	    Social Contracts, Reciprocity, and Gift Economies in Cyberspace
    12	
    13	    The network of communications that constitutes a virtual community
    14	can include the exchange of information as a kind of commodity, and
    15	the economic implications of this phenomenon are significant; the
    16	ultimate social potential of the network, however, lies not solely in
    17	its utility as an information market, but in the individual and group
    18	relationships that can happen over time. When such a group accumulates
    19	a sufficient number of friendships and rivalries, and witnesses the
    20	births, marriages, and deaths that bond any other kind of community,
    21	it takes on a definite and profound sense of place in people's minds.
    22	Virtual communities usually have a geographically local focus, and
    23	often have a connection to a much wider domain. The local focus of my
    24	virtual community, the WELL, is the San Francisco Bay Area; the wider
    25	locus consists of hundreds of thousands of other sites around the
    26	world, and millions of other communitarians, linked via exchanges of
    27	messages into a meta-community known as "the net."
    28	
    29	    The existence of computer-linked communities was predicted twenty
    30	years ago by J.C.R. Licklider and Robert Taylor, who as research
    31	directors for the Department of Defense, set in motion the research
    32	that resulted in the creation of the first such community, the
    33	ARPAnet: "What will on-line interactive communities be like?"
    34	Licklider and Taylor wrote, in 1968: "In most fields they will consist
    35	of geographically separated members, sometimes grouped in small
    36	clusters and sometimes working individually. They will be communities
    37	not of common location, but of common interest..."
    38	
    39	    My friends and I sometimes believe we are part of the future that
    40	Licklider dreamed about, and we often can attest to the truth of his
    41	prediction that "life will be happier for the on-line individual
    42	because the people with whom one interacts most strongly will be
    43	selected more by commonality of interests and goals than by accidents
    44	of proximity." I still believe that, but I also know that life also
    45	has turned out to be unhappy at times, intensely so in some
    46	circumstances, because of words on a screen. Events in cyberspace can
    47	have concrete effects in real life, of both the pleasant and less
    48	pleasant varieties. Participating in a virtual community has not
    49	solved all of life's problems for me, but it has served as an aid, a
    50	comfort and an inspiration at times; at other times, it has been like
    51	an endless, ugly, long-simmering family brawl.
    52	
    53	    I visit the WELL both for the sheer pleasure of communicating with
    54	my newfound friends, and for its value as a practical instrument
    55	forgathering information on subjects that are of momentary or enduring
    56	importance, from child care to neuroscience, technical questions on
    57	telecommunications to arguments on philosophical, political, or
    58	spiritual subjects. It's a bit like a neighborhood pub or coffee shop.
    59	It's a little like a salon, where I can participate in a hundred
    60	ongoing conversations with people who don't care what I look like or
    61	sound like, but who do care how I think and communicate. There are
    62	seminars and word fights in different corners. And it's all a little
    63	like a groupmind, where questions are answered, support is given,
    64	inspiration is provided, by people I may have never heard from before,
    65	and whom I may never meet face to face.
    66	
    67	    Because we cannot see one another, we are unable to form
    68	prejudices about others before we read what they have to say: Race,
    69	gender, age, national origin and physical appearance are not apparent
    70	unless a person wants to make such characteristics public. People who
    71	are thoughtful but who are not quick to formulate a reply often do
    72	better in CMC than face to face or over the telephone. People whose
    73	physical handicaps make it difficult to form new friendships find that
    74	virtual communities treat them as they always wanted to be treated --
    75	as thinkers and transmitters of ideas and feeling beings, not carnal
    76	vessels with a certain appearance and way of walking and talking (or
    77	not walking and not talking). Don't mistake this filtration of
    78	appearances for dehumanization: Words on a screen are quite capable of
    79	moving one to laughter or tears, of evoking anger or compassion, of
    80	creating a community from a collection of strangers.
    81	
    82	    How does anybody find friends? In the traditional community, we
    83	search through our pool of neighbors and professional colleagues, of
    84	acquaintances and acquaintances of acquaintances, in order to find
    85	people who share our values and interests. We then exchange
    86	information about one another, disclose and discuss our mutual
    87	interests, and sometimes we become friends. In a virtual community we
    88	can go directly to the place where our favorite subjects are being
    89	discussed, then get acquainted with those who share our passions, or
    90	who use words in a way we find attractive. In this sense, the topic is
    91	the address: You can't simply pick up a phone and ask to be connected
    92	with someone who wants to talk about Islamic art or California wine,
    93	or someone with a three year old daughter or a 30 year old Hudson; you
    94	can, however, join a computer conference on any of those topics, then
    95	open a public or private correspondence with the previously-unknown
    96	people you find in that conference. You will find that your chances of
    97	making friends are magnified by orders of magnitude over the old
    98	methods of finding a peer group.
    99	
   100	    You can be fooled about people in cyberspace, behind the cloak of
   101	words. But that can be said about telephones or face to face
   102	communications, as well; computer-mediated communications provide new
   103	ways to fool people, and the most obvious identity-swindles will die
   104	out only when enough people learn to use the medium critically. Sara
   105	Kiesler noted that the word "phony" is an artifact of the early years
   106	of the telephone, when media-naive people were conned by slick talkers
   107	in ways that wouldn't deceive an eight-year old with a cellular phone
   108	today.
   109	
   110	    There is both an intellectual and an emotional component to CMC.
   111	Since so many members of virtual communities are the kind of
   112	knowledge-based professionals whose professional standing can be
   113	enhanced by what they know, virtual communities can be practical,
   114	cold-blooded instruments. Virtual communities can help their members
   115	cope with information overload. The problem with the information age,
   116	especially for students and knowledge workers who spend their time
   117	immersed in the info-flow, is that there is too much information
   118	available and no effective filters for sifting the key data that are
   119	useful and interesting to us as individuals. Programmers are trying to
   120	design better and better "software agents" that can seek and sift,
   121	filter and find, and save us from the awful feeling one gets when it
   122	turns out that the specific knowledge one needs is buried in 15,000
   123	pages of related information.
   124	
   125	    The first software agents are now becoming available (e.g., WAIS,
   126	Rosebud), but we already have far more sophisticated, if informal,
   127	social contracts among groups of people that allow us to act as
   128	software agents for one another. If, in my wanderings through
   129	information space, I come across items that don't interest me but
   130	which I know one of my worldwide loose-knit affinity group of online
   131	friends would appreciate, I send the appropriate friend a pointer, or
   132	simply forward the entire text (one of the new powers of CMC is the
   133	ability to publish and converse with the same medium). In some cases,
   134	I can put the information in exactly the right place for 10,000 people
   135	I don't know, but who are intensely interested in that specific topic,
   136	to find it when they need it. And sometimes, 10,000 people I don't
   137	know do the same thing for me.
   138	
   139	    This unwritten, unspoken social contract, a blend of strong-tie
   140	and weak-tie relationships among people who have a mixture of motives,
   141	requires one to give something, and enables one to receive something.
   142	I have to keep my friends in mind and send them pointers instead of
   143	throwing my informational discards into the virtual scrap-heap. It
   144	doesn't take a great deal of energy to do that, since I have to sift
   145	
   146	that information anyway in order to find the knowledge I seek for my
   147	own purposes; it takes two keystrokes to delete the information, three
   148	keystrokes to forward it to someone else. And with scores of other
   149	people who have an eye out for my interests while they explore sectors
   150	of the information space that I normally wouldn't frequent, I find
   151	that the help I receive far outweighs the energy I expend helping
   152	others: A marriage of altruism and self-interest.
   153	
   154	    The first time I learned about that particular cyberspace power
   155	was early in the history of the WELL, when I was invited to join a
   156	panel of experts who advise the U.S. Congress Office of Technology
   157	Assessment (OTA). The subject of the assessment was "Communication
   158	Systems for an Information Age." I'm not an expert in
   159	telecommunication technology or policy, but I do know where to find a
   160	group of such experts, and how to get them to tell me what they know.
   161	Before I went to Washington for my first panel meeting, I opened a
   162	conference in the WELL and invited assorted information-freaks,
   163	technophiles, and communication experts to help me come up with
   164	something to say. An amazing collection of minds flocked to that
   165	topic, and some of them created whole new communities when they
   166	collided.
   167	
   168	    By the time I sat down with the captains of industry, government
   169	advisers, and academic experts at the panel table, I had over 200
   170	pages of expert advice from my own panel. I wouldn't have been able to
   171	integrate that much knowledge of my subject in an entire academic or
   172	industrial career, and it only took me (and my virtual community) a
   173	few minutes a day for six weeks. I have found the WELL to be an
   174	outright magical resource, professionally. An editor or producer or
   175	client can call and ask me if I know much about the Constitution, or
   176	fiber optics, or intellectual property. "Let me get back to you in
   177	twenty minutes," I say, reaching for the modem. In terms of the way I
   178	learned to use the WELL to get the right piece of information at the
   179	right time, I'd say that the hours I've spent putting information into
   180	the WELL turned out to be the most lucrative professional investments
   181	I've ever made.
   182	
   183	    The same strategy of nurturing and making use of loose
   184	information-sharing affiliations across the net can be applied to an
   185	infinite domain of problem areas, from literary criticism to software
   186	evaluation. It's a neat way for a sufficiently large, sufficiently
   187	diverse group of people to multiply their individual degree of
   188	expertise, and I think it could be done even if the people aren't
   189	involved in a community other than their company or their research
   190	specialty. I think it works better when the community's conceptual
   191	model of itself is more like barn-raising than horse-trading, though.
   192	Reciprocity is a key element of any market-based culture, but the
   193	arrangement I'm describing feels to me more like a kind of gift
   194	economy where people do things for one another out of a spirit of
   195	building something between them, rather than a spreadsheet-calculated
   196	quid pro quo. When that spirit exists, everybody gets a little extra
   197	something, a little sparkle, from their more practical transactions;
   198	different kinds of things become possible when this mindset pervades.
   199	Conversely, people who have valuable things to add to the mix tend to
   200	keep their heads down and their ideas to themselves when a mercenary
   201	or hostile zeitgeist dominates an online community.
   202	
   203	    If you give useful information freely, without demanding tightly-
   204	coupled reciprocity, your requests for information are met more
   205	swiftly, in greater detail, than they would have been otherwise. The
   206	person  you help might never be in a position to help you, but someone
   207	else might be. That's why it is hard to distinguish idle talk from
   208	serious context-setting. In a virtual community, idle talk is context-
   209	setting. Idle talk is where people learn what kind of person you are,
   210	why you should be trusted or mistrusted, what interests you. An agora
   211	is more than the site of transactions; it is also a place where people
   212	meet and size up one another.
   213	
   214	    A market depends on the quality of knowledge held by the
   215	participants, the buyers and sellers, about price and availability and
   216	a thousand other things that influence business; a market that has a
   217	forum for informal and back-channel communications is a better-
   218	informed market. The London Stock Exchange grew out of the informal
   219	transactions in a coffee-house; when it became the London
   220	International Stock Exchange a few years ago, and abolished the
   221	trading-room floor, the enterprise lost something vital in the
   222	transition from an old room where all the old boys met and cut their
   223	deals to the screens of thousands of workstations scattered around the
   224	world.
   225	
   226	    The context of the informal community of knowledge sharers grew to
   227	include years of both professional and personal relationships. It is
   228	not news that the right network of people can serve as an inquiry
   229	research system: You throw out the question, and somebody on the net
   230	knows the answer. You can make a game out of it, where you gain
   231	symbolic prestige among your virtual peers by knowing the answer. And
   232	you can make a game out of it among a group of people who have dropped
   233	out of their orthodox professional lives, where some of them sell
   234	these information services for exorbitant rates, in order to
   235	participate voluntarily in the virtual community game.
   236	
   237	    Virtual communities have several drawbacks in comparison to face-
   238	to-face communication, disadvantages that must be kept in mind if you
   239	are to make use of the power of these computer-mediated discussion
   240	groups. The filtration factor that prevents one from knowing the race
   241	or age of another participant also prevents people from communicating
   242	the facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice that
   243	constitute the inaudible but vital component of most face to face
   244	communications. Irony, sarcasm, compassion, and other subtle but all-
   245	important nuances that aren't conveyed in words alone are lost when
   246	all you can see of a person are words on a screen.
   247	
   248	    It's amazing how the ambiguity of words in the absence of body
   249	language inevitably leads to online misunderstandings. And since the
   250	physical absence of other people also seems to loosen some of the
   251	social bonds that prevent people from insulting one another in person,
   252	misunderstandings can grow into truly nasty stuff before anybody has a
   253	chance to untangle the original miscommunication. Heated diatribes and
   254	interpersonal incivility that wouldn't crop up often in face to face
   255	or even telephone discourse seem to appear with relative frequency in
   256	computer conferences. The only presently available antidote to this
   257	flaw of CMC as a human communication medium is widespread knowledge of
   258	this flaw -- aka "Netiquette."
   259	
   260	    Online civility and how to deal with breaches of it is a topic
   261	unto itself, and has been much-argued on the WELL. Degrees of outright
   262	incivility constitute entire universes such as alt.flame, the Usenet
   263	newsgroup where people go specifically to spend their days hurling
   264	vile imprecations at one another. I am beginning to suspect that the
   265	most powerful and effective defense an online community has in the
   266	face of those who are bent on disruption might be norms and agreements
   267	about withdrawing attention from those who can't abide by even loose
   268	rules of verbal behavior. "If you continue doing that," I remember
   269	someone saying to a particularly persistent would-be disrupter, "we
   270	will stop paying attention to you." This is technically easy to do on
   271	Usenet, where putting the name of a person or topic header in a "kill
   272	file" (aka "bozo filter") means you will never see future
   273	contributions from that person or about that topic. You can simply
   274	choose to not see any postings from Rich Rosen, or that feature the
   275	word "abortion" in the title. A society in which people can remove one
   276	another, or even entire topics of discussion, from visibility. The
   277	WELL does not have a bozo filter, although the need for one is a topic
   278	of frequent discussion.
   279	
   280	
   281	
   282	
   283	    Who Is The WELL?
   284	
   285	    One way to know what the WELL is like is to know something about the
   286	kind of people who use it. It has roots in the San Francisco Bay Area,
   287	and in two separate cultural revolutions that took place there in past
   288	decades. The Whole Earth Catalog originally emerged from the
   289	counterculture as Stewart Brand's way of providing access to tools and
   290	ideas to all the communes who were exploring alternate ways of life in
   291	the forests of Mendocino or the high deserts outside Santa Fe. The Whole
   292	Earth Catalogs and the magazines they spawned, Co-Evolution Quarterly
   293	and Whole Earth Review, have outlived the counterculture itself, since
   294	they are still alive and raising hell after nearly 25 years. For many
   295	years, the people who have been exploring alternatives and are open to
   296	ideas that you don't find in the mass media have found themselves in
   297	cities instead of rural communes, where their need for new tools and
   298	ideas didn't go away.
   299	
   300	    The Whole Earth Catalog crew received a large advance in the mid-
   301	1980s to produce an updated version, a project involving many
   302	geographically-separated authors and editors, many of whom were using
   303	computers. They bought a minicomputer and the license to Picospan, a
   304	computer conferencing program, leased an office next to the magazine's
   305	office, leased incoming telephone lines, set up modems, and the WELL was
   306	born in 1985. The idea from the beginning was that the founders weren't
   307	sure what the WELL would become, but they would provide tools for people
   308	to build it into something useful. It was consciously a cultural
   309	experiment, and the business was designed to succeed or fail on the
   310	basis of the results of the experiment. The person Stewart Brand chose
   311	to be the WELL's first director -- technician, manager, innkeeper, and
   312	bouncer -- was Matthew McClure, not-coincidentally a computer-savvy
   313	veteran of The Farm, one of the most successful of the communes that
   314	started in the sixties. Brand and McClure started a low- rules,
   315	high-tone discussion, where savvy networkers, futurists, misfits who had
   316	learned how to make our outsiderness work for us, could take the
   317	technology of CMC to its cultural limits.
   318	
   319	    The Whole Earth network -- the granola-eating utopians, the solar-
   320	power enthusiasts, serious ecologists and the space-station crowd,
   321	immortalists, Biospherians, environmentalists, social activists -- was
   322	part of the core population from the beginning. But there were a couple
   323	of other key elements. One was the subculture that happened ten years
   324	after the counterculture era -- the personal computer revolution.
   325	Personal computers and the PC industry were created by young iconoclasts
   326	who wanted to have whizzy tools and change the world. Whole Earth had
   327	honored them, including the outlaws among them, with the early Hacker's
   328	Conferences. The young computer wizards, and the grizzled old hands who
   329	were still messing with mainframes, showed up early at the WELL because
   330	the guts of the system itself -- the UNIX operating system and "C"
   331	language programming code -- were available for tinkering by responsible
   332	craftsmen.
   333	
   334	    A third cultural element that made up the initial mix of the WELL,
   335	which has drifted from its counterculture origins in many ways, were the
   336	deadheads. Books and theses have been written about the subculture that
   337	have grown up around the band, the Grateful Dead. The deadheads have a
   338	strong feeling of community, but they can only manifest it en masse when
   339	the band has concerts. They were a community looking for a place to
   340	happen when several technology-savvy deadheads started a "Grateful Dead
   341	Conference" on the WELL. GD was so phenomenally successful that for the
   342	first several years, deadheads were by far the single largest source of
   343	income for the enterprise.
   344	
   345	    Along with the other elements came the first marathon swimmers in
   346	the new currents of the information streams, the futurists and writers
   347	and journalists. The New York Times, Business Week, the San Francisco
   348	Chronicle, Time, Rolling Stone, Byte, the Wall Street Journal all have
   349	journalists that I know personally who drop into the WELL as a listening
   350	post. People in Silicon Valley lurk to hear loose talk among the pros.
   351	Journalists tend to attract other journalists, and the purpose of
   352	journalists is to attract everybody else: most people have to use an old
   353	medium to hear news about the arrival of a new medium.
   354	
   355	    Things changed, both rapidly and slowly, in the WELL. There were
   356	about 600 members of the WELL when I joined, in the summer of 1985. It
   357	seemed that then, as now, the usual ten percent of the members did 80%
   358	of the talking. Now there are about 6000 people, with a net gain of
   359	about a hundred a month. There do seem to be more women than other parts
   360	of cyberspace. Most of the people I meet seem to be white or Asian;
   361	African-Americans aren't missing, but they aren't conspicuous or even
   362	visible. If you can fake it, gender and age are invisible, too. I'd
   363	guess the WELL consists of about 80% men, 20% women. I don't know
   364	whether formal demographics would be the kind of thing that most WELL
   365	users would want to contribute to. It's certainly something we'd
   366	discuss, argue, debate, joke about.
   367	
   368	    One important social rule was built into Picospan, the software that
   369	the WELL lives inside: Nobody is anonymous. Everybody is required to
   370	attach their real "userid" to their postings. It is possible to use
   371	pseudonyms to create alternate identities, or to carry metamessages, but
   372	the pseudonyms are always linked in every posting to the real userid. So
   373	individual personae -- whether or not they correspond closely to the
   374	real person who owns the account -- are responsible for the words they
   375	post. In fact, the first several years, the screen that you saw when you
   376	reached the WELL said "You own your own words."  Stewart Brand, the
   377	WELL's co-founder likes epigrams: "Whole Earth," "Information wants to
   378	be free." "You own your own words." Like the best epigrams, "You own
   379	your own words" is open to multiple interpretations. The matter of
   380	responsibility and ownership of words is one of the topics WELLbeings
   381	argue about endlessly, so much that the phrase has been abbreviated to
   382	"YOYOW," As in, "Oh no, another YOYOW debate."
   383	
   384	    Who are the WELL members, and what do they talk about? I can tell
   385	you about the individuals I have come to know over six years, but the
   386	WELL has long since been something larger than the sum of everybody's
   387	friends. The characteristics of the pool of people who tune into this
   388	electronic listening post, whether or not they every post a word in
   389	public, is a strong determinant of the flavor of the "place." There's a
   390	cross-sectional feeling of "who are we?" that transcends the
   391	intersecting and non-intersecting rings of friends and acquaintances
   392	each individual develops.
   393	
   394	    My Neighborhood On The WELL
   395	
   396	    Every CMC system gives users tools for creating their own sense of
   397	place, by customizing the way they navigate through the database of
   398	conferences, topics, and responses. A conference or newsgroup is like a
   399	place you go. If you go to several different places in a fixed order, it
   400	seems to reinforce the feeling of place by creating a customized
   401	neighborhood that is also shared by others. You see some of the same
   402	users in different parts of the same neighborhood. Some faces, you see
   403	only in one context -- the parents conference, the Grateful Dead tours
   404	conference, the politics or sex conference.
   405	
   406	    My home neighborhood on the WELL is reflected in my ".cflist," the
   407	file that records my preferences about the order of conferences I visit.
   408	It is always possible to go to any conference with a command, but with a
   409	.cflist you structure your online time by going from conference to
   410	specified conference at regular intervals, reading and perhaps
   411	responding in several ongoing threads in several different places.
   412	That's the part of the art of discourse where I have found that the
   413	computer adds value to the intellectual activity of discussing formally
   414	distinct subjects asynchronously, from different parts of the world,
   415	over extending periods, by enabling groups to structure conversations by
   416	topic, over time.
   417	
   418	    My .cflist starts, for sentimental reasons, with the Mind
   419	conference, the first one I hosted on the WELL, since 1985. I've changed
   420	my .cflist hundreds of times over the years, to add or delete
   421	conferences from my regular neighborhood, but I've always kept Mind in
   422	the lede. The entry banner screen for the Mind conference used to
   423	display to each user the exact phase of the moon in numbers and ASCII
   424	graphics every time they logged in to the conference. But the volunteer
   425	programmer who had created the "phoon" program had decided to withdraw
   426	it, years later, in a dispute with WELL management. There is often a
   427	technological fix to a social problem within this particular universe.
   428	Because the WELL seems to be an intersection of many different cultures,
   429	there have been many experiments with software tools to ameliorate
   430	problems that seemed to crop up between people, whether because of the
   431	nature of the medium or the nature of the people. A frighteningly
   432	expensive pool of talent was donated by volunteer programmers to create
   433	tools and even weapons for WELL users to deal with each other. People
   434	keep giving things to the WELL, and taking them away. Offline readers
   435	and online tools by volunteer programmers gave others increased power to
   436	communicate.
   437	
   438	    The News conference is what's next. This is the commons, the place
   439	where the most people visit the most often, where the most outrageous
   440	off-topic proliferation is least pernicious, where the important
   441	announcements about the system or social events or major disputes or new
   442	conferences are announced. When an earthquake or fire happens, News is
   443	
   444	where you want to go. Immediately after the 1989 earthquake and during
   445	the Oakland fire of 1991, the WELL was a place to check the damage to
   446	the local geographic community, lend help to those who need it, and get
   447	first-hand reports. During Tienamen square, the Gulf War, the Soviet
   448	Coup, the WELL was a media-funnel, with snippets of email from Tel-Aviv
   449	and entire newsgroups fed by fax machines in China, erupting in News
   450	conference topics that grew into fast-moving conferences of their own.
   451	During any major crisis in the real world, the routine at our house is
   452	to turn on CNN and log into the WELL.
   453	
   454	    After News is Hosts, where the hottest stuff usually happens. The
   455	hosts community is a story in itself. The success of the WELL in its
   456	first five years, all would agree, rested heavily on the efforts of the
   457	conference hosts -- online characters who had created the character of
   458	the first neighborhoods and kept the juice flowing between one another
   459	all over the WELL, but most pointedly in the Hosts conference. Some
   460	spicy reading in the Archives conference originated from old hosts'
   461	disputes - and substantial arguments about the implications of CMC for
   462	civil rights, intellectual property, censorship, by a lot of people who
   463	know what they are talking about, mixed liberally with a lot of other
   464	people who don't know what they are talking about, but love to talk
   465	anyway, via keyboard and screen, for years on end.
   466	
   467	    In this virtual place, the pillars of the community and the worst
   468	offenders of public sensibilities are in the same group -- the hosts.
   469	At their best and their worst, this ten percent of the online population
   470	put out the words that the other ninety percent keep paying to read.
   471	Like good hosts at any social gathering, they make newcomers welcome,
   472	keep the conversation flowing, mediate disputes, clean up messes, and
   473	throw out miscreants, if need be. A WELL host is part salon keeper, part
   474	saloon keeper, part talk-show host, part publisher.  The only power to
   475	censor or to ban a user is the hosts' power. Policy varies from host to
   476	host, and that's the only policy. The only justice for those who misuse
   477	that power is the forced participation in weeks of debilitating and
   478	vituperative post-mortem.
   479	
   480	    The hosts community is part long-running soap opera, part town
   481	meeting, bar-room brawl, anarchic debating society, creative groupmind,
   482	bloody arena, union hall, playpen, encounter group. The Hosts conference
   483	is extremely general, from technical questions to personal attacks. The
   484	Policy conference is supposed to be restricted to matters of what WELL
   485	policy is, or ought to be. The part-delusion, part-accurate perception
   486	that the hosts and other users have strong influence over WELL policy is
   487	part of what feeds debate here, and a strong element in the libertarian
   488	reputation of the stereotypical WELLite. After fighting my way through a
   489	day's or hour's worth of the Hot New Dispute in News, Hosts, and Policy,
   490	I check on the conferences I host -- Info, Virtual Communities, Virtual
   491	Reality. After that my .cflist directs me, at the press of the return
   492	key, to the first new topic or response in the Parenting, Writers',
   493	Grateful Dead tours, Telecommunication, Macintosh, Weird, Electronic
   494	Frontier Foundation, Whole Earth, Books, Media, Men on the WELL,
   495	Miscellaneous, and Unclear conferences.
   496	
   497	    Grabbing attention in the Commons is a powerful act. Some people
   498	seem drawn to performing there; others burst out there in acts of
   499	desperation, after one history of frustration or another. Dealing with
   500	people who are so consistently off-topic or apparently deeply grooved
   501	into incoherence, long-windedness, scatology, is one of the events that
   502	challenges a community to decide what its values really are, or ought to
   503	be.
   504	
   505	    Something is happening here. I'm not sure anybody understands it
   506	yet. I know that the WELL and the net is an important part of my life
   507	and I have to decide for myself whether this is a new way to make
   508	genuine commitments to other human beings, or a silicon-induced illusion
   509	of community. I urge others to help pursue that question in a variety of
   510	ways, while we have the time. The political dimensions of CMC might lead
   511	to situations that would pre-empt questions of other social effects;
   512	responses to the need for understanding the power- relationships
   513	inherent in CMC are well represented by the Electronic Frontier
   514	Foundation and others. We need to learn a lot more, very quickly, about
   515	what kind of place our minds are homesteading.
   516	
   517	    The future of virtual communities is connected to the future of
   518	everything else, starting with the most precious thing people have to
   519	gain or lose -- political freedom. The part played by communication
   520	technologies in the disintegration of communism, the way broadcast
   521	television pre-empted the American electoral process, the power of fax
   522	and CMC networks during times of political repression like Tienamen
   523	Square and the Soviet Coup attempt, the power of citizen electronic
   524	journalism, the power-maneuvering of law enforcement and intelligence
   525	agencies to restrict rights of citizen access and expression in
   526	cyberspace, all point to the future of CMC as a close correlate of
   527	future political scenarios. More important than civilizing cyberspace is
   528	ensuring its freedom as a citizen-to-citizen communication and
   529	publication medium; laws that infringe equity of access to and freedom
   530	of expression in cyberspace could transform today's populist empowerment
   531	into yet another instrument of manipulation. Will "electronic democracy"
   532	be an accurate description of political empowerment that grows out of
   533	the screen of a computer? Or will it become a brilliant piece of
   534	disinfotainment, another means of manipulating emotions and
   535	manufacturing public opinion in the service of power.
   536	
   537	    Who controls what kinds of information is communicated in the
   538	international networks where virtual communities live? Who censors, and
   539	what is censored? Who safeguards the privacy of individuals in the face
   540	of technologies that make it possible to amass and retrieve detailed
   541	personal information about every member of a large population? The
   542	answers to these political questions might make moot any more abstract
   543	questions about cultures in cyberspace. Democracy itself depends on the
   544	relatively free flow of communications. The following words by James
   545	Madison are carved in marble at the United States Library of Congress:
   546	"A popular government without popular information, or the means of
   547	acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy, or perhaps
   548	both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance, and a people who mean to
   549	be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which
   550	knowledge gives." It is time for people to arm themselves with power
   551	about the future of CMC technology.
   552	
   553	    Who controls the market for relationships? Will the world's
   554	increasingly interlinked, increasingly powerful, decreasingly costly
   555	communications infrastructure be controlled by a small number of very
   556	large companies? Will cyberspace be privatized and parceled out to those
   557	who can afford to buy into the auction? If political forces do not seize
   558	the high ground and end today's freewheeling exchange of ideas, it is
   559	still possible for a more benevolent form of economic control to stunt
   560	the evolution of virtual communities, if a small number of companies
   561	gain the power to put up toll-roads in the information networks, and
   562	smaller companies are not able to compete with them.
   563	
   564	    Or will there be an open market, in which newcomers like Apple or
   565	Microsoft can become industry leaders? The playing field in the global
   566	telecommunications industry will never be level, but the degree of
   567	individual freedom available through telecommunication technologies in
   568	the future may depend upon whether the market for goods and services in
   569	cyberspace remains open for new companies to create new uses for CMC.
   570	
   571	    I present these observations as a set of questions, not as answers.
   572	I believe that we need to try to understand the nature of CMC,
   573	cyberspace, and virtual communities in every important context --
   574	politically, economically, socially , culturally, cognitively. Each
   575	different perspective reveals something that the other perspectives do
   576	not reveal. Each different discipline fails to see something that
   577	another discipline sees very well. We need to think as teams here,
   578	across boundaries of academic discipline, industrial affiliation,
   579	nation, to understand, and thus perhaps regain control of, the way human
   580	communities are being transformed by communication technologies.  We
   581	can't do this solely as dispassionate observers, although there is
   582	certainly a huge need for the detached assessment of social science.
   583	But community is a matter of the heart and the gut as well as the head.
   584	Some of the most important learning will always have to be done by
   585	jumping into one corner or another of cyberspace, living there, and
   586	getting up to your elbows in the problems that virtual communities face.
