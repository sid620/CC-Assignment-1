     1	BOSTON, Mass., February 11, 1992 -- Emerald Systems is demonstrating its
     2	newest network data management software, Xpress Librarian, here this week
     3	at Booth 2724 during NetWorld '92 Boston.
     4	
     5	Xpress Librarian is much more than a traditional backup/restore system.
     6	Designed for ease of use, it runs under Microsoft Windows in either
     7	standard or enhanced mode from the administrator's workstation and is the
     8	first such software with several advanced features, allowing disk
     9	grooming, file aging and archiving.
    10	
    11	With Xpress Librarian, users can select specific files or groups of files
    12	for off-line archival on the basis of several different user-specified
    13	criteria. The file-aging feature allows users to set aging criteria using
    14	a variety of parameters, including access or modification date. Thus,
    15	files that have been inactive for a given period of time easily can be
    16	archived to tape.
    17	
    18	Xpress Librarian also lets network administrators monitor how the server
    19	disk space is being used. The file usage utility allows them to search the
    20	network by individual user to determine how network space is being used --
    21	and who is using it. This is an important data management and network
    22	trouble-shooting tool.
    23	
    24	When a file needs to be restored, Xpress Librarian will direct the user to
    25	the exact location of every version of that file -- even if it resides on
    26	several different tapes. When the desired version is selected, Xpress
    27	Librarian will prompt the user for the correct tape and begin restoration
    28	of the file. When used with the Quick File Access feature found in many
    29	Emerald Systems tape drives, this process usually is completed in less
    30	than two minutes.
    31	
    32	"It's a joy to use," says the computer systems manager for a civil
    33	engineering and survey company in Grand Rapids, Mich., when asked how he
    34	liked Xpress Librarian. The network manager for a large department store
    35	chain headquartered in Seattle said he found Xpress Librarian
    36	"straightforward and easy to install and use."
    37	
    38	"We upgraded to Xpress Librarian primarily because it allows us to find
    39	files quickly," said the network administrator for an international
    40	management company in Atlanta, Ga.
    41	
    42	As Emerald Systems President and CEO James D. Norrod points out, "Xpress
    43	Librarian is the premier software product in our migration from being the
    44	industry's best developer of tape backup products to being the leading
    45	supplier of network data management solutions."
    46	
    47	The new network data management system is designed for mid- to high-range
    48	networks and supports a variety of hardware platforms, ranging from 250 MB
    49	1/4" tape to 5.0 GB 8mm systems. Xpress Librarian is compatible with other
    50	Emerald Systems software products and supports NetWare 2.15 and higher and
    51	DOS 3.3 and higher. It operates on a 286 or 386 workstation.
    52	
    53	Emerald Systems supplies high-quality network backup and data management
    54	solutions worldwide. For further information about Xpress Librarian,
