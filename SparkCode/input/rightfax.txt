     1	February 11, 1992, Boston, MA. Cracchiolo & Feder, Inc. today announced the
     2	release of RightFAX 2.0, a totally rewritten version of it's network fax
     3	solution. RightFAX 2.0 incorporates the benefits of client-server
     4	technology and a Windows 3.0 and 3.1 front-end -- improving performance
     5	and reducing support problems. "RightFAX 2.0 has been redesigned using
     6	more client-server technology than previous versions to provide a more
     7	robust solution for today' s demanding networks," said Bradley Feder,
     8	President of Cracchiolo & Feder, Inc.
     9	
    10	RightFAX 2.0 now supports a variety of fax boards including the Brooktrout
    11	TR-112 series and the Gammalink CP series. "Faxing is critical for
    12	communicating overseas. RightFAX' s support of these boards provides for
    13	more international connections, and the Gammalink CP-MC board addresses
    14	the needs of the MicroChannel market which adds depth to the RightFAX
    15	product line," said Joseph Cracchiolo, Vice President of R&D. RightFAX 2.0
    16	also includes additional international character set support.
    17	
    18	RightFAX 2.0 is a multi-channel network fax utility product that allows PC
    19	clients to send and receive fax documents from their network workstation.
    20	Outgoing documents can be faxed by printing them to a standard network
    21	print queue from any software application package. As for incoming faxes,
    22	RightFAX offers several routing options including Direct-Inward-Dial. The
    23	new version adds support of DTMF codes which enables callers to route
    24	faxes with tone or voice prompts. RightFAX 2.0's DTMF routing technology
    25	can also be configured to interface with PBX systems.
    26	
    27	Supporting NetWare, LAN Manager and OS/2 LAN Server, RightFAX 2.0 added a
    28	new Windows fax viewer which allows documents to be scaled, flipped, and
    29	edited in graphics mode. A new NetWare version of RightFAX utilizes an
    30	OS/2 based fax server for increased throughput. A NetWare fax server now
    31	supports up to 32 print queues on 32 file servers, supports up to 16 phone
    32	lines or a maximum of 8 fax boards, and services Windows, DOS, & OS/2
