   141	          Many of these programs are available on a local bulletin board
   142	          system (BBS) in your area.  This catalog may not contain all ASP

   144	          itself should be sent to the Association of Shareware Profes-

   146	          If you have a CompuServe account, you can also leave a message in

   151	          What is the ASP?
   152	
   153	          The Association of Shareware Professionals (ASP) was formed in
   154	          1987 to strengthen the future of 'shareware' (user-supported
   155	          software) as an alternative to software distributed under normal
   156	          retail marketing methods.  ASP members subscribe to a code of
   157	          ethics and are committed to the concept of shareware as a way of
   158	          marketing.  See page 6 if you'd like to join the ASP or learn
   159	          some more about us.
   160	
   161	          The ASP itself does NOT rate members' software for functionality
   162	          or usefulness.  That is for you -- the user -- to decide.  Share-
   163	          ware software, especially that which is authorized to carry the
   164	          ASP logo, can be tested on a try-before-you-buy basis.  If the
   165	          application doesn't fit your needs, you won't have to worry about
   166	          getting a refund.  (That's the beauty of the shareware marketing
   167	          concept.)

   173	               'These programs are produced by members of the Asso-
   174	               ciation of Shareware Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to
   175	               make sure that the shareware principle works for you.
   176	               If you are unable to resolve a shareware-related problem
   177	               with an ASP member by contacting the member directly,
   178	               ASP may be able to help.  The ASP Ombudsman can help you
   179	               resolve a dispute or problem with an ASP member, but
   180	               does not provide technical support for members'
   181	               products.  Please write to the ASP Ombudsman at P.O. Box
   182	               5786, Bellevue, WA 98006 or send a Compuserve message
   183	               via easyplex to ASP Ombudsman 70007,3536'

   185	
   186	          Tips & Hints
   187	
   188	          If you have questions about a particular product, check in the
   189	          index to see if there is a cross-reference for the program.  An
   190	          entire appendix is devoted to authors' addresses & telephone
   191	          numbers.  You might be able to get some help from them.
   192	
   193	          New or updated programs are marked with '[***]' in the far right
   194	          corner.  You can use your favorite word processor to hunt for
   195	          that string so you can see what's changed since last month.
   196	
   197	          The 'BBS filename' shown with each product is the author's
   198	          preferred spelling for the filename and it usually has some sort
   199	          of connection to the program's version number.  If your local BBS
   200	          has an earlier version of the program, it will probably be under
   201	          a different filename.  Even if it is the current version, some
   202	          people upload the file as a different filename.  You would be
   203	          wise to search for variations in spelling.  Your local BBS sysop
   204	          can tell you how to do this.
   205	
   206	          ASP authors are only human, and they sometimes forget to supply
   207	          all information before this list goes out.  We apologize if you
   208	          see '??' where there should be a piece of information.
   209	
   210	          Some applications are contained in multiple files, but you should
   211	          be warned of this in the description.
   212	
   213	          Be sure to check the file size BEFORE you begin downloading.
   214	          Many of these products are bigger than 100k, and some are bigger
   215	          than 200k.  Find out how big the file is before you go for it.
   216	
   217	          A few applications have what can be described as 'conditional'
   218	          fees.  Some may only need to be registered if the program will be
   219	          used in making a profit.  Others may offer source code to the
   220	          program for a higher fee.  The price you see here may not always
   221	          be the price you have to pay -- it could be higher or lower.  It
   222	          'pays' to read the fine print in the documentation provided with
   223	          any shareware application.
   224	
   225	          Enjoy the catalog.

  4153	          This appendix is designed to let you find the name & address of
  4154	          ASP authors & companies with a product you'd like to know more
  4155	          about.  Some offer non-registered evaluation disks through the

  4157	          call for more information.

  4159	               Shareware is as safe as commercial software if obtained

  4164	          You can manually search this appendix for information about a
  4165	          product, or you can use the index to find the right page.  All
  4166	          you need to know is the name of the product (not the name of the
  4167	          file).  Product names are almost always noted in the description.
  4168	
  4169	          One final note: this appendix is "free format".  Authors can say
  4170	          whatever they like as long as they don't go over four lines.  We
  4171	          encourage them to include an address and maybe a phone number,
  4172	          but it's up to them.  What you see here is exactly what they told
  4173	          us to put in the appendix.

  4175	          We hope you find this appendix to be useful.

  4859	                                DISK VENDOR ADDRESSES
  4860	
  4861	          This appendix is designed to let you find the name & address of
  4862	          disk vendors who maintain an associate membership in the ASP.
  4863	          Every one of these disk vendors meets the ASP's minimum standards
  4864	          for business ethics in the field of disk copying services.
  4865	
  4866	               Shareware is as safe as commercial software if obtained
  4867	               directly from an author or from a vendor or BBS who has
  4868	               gotten the disk directly from the author.
  4869	                              -- an official ASP statement on shareware
  4870	
  4871	          Disk vendors, especially ASP-approved disk vendors, provide a
  4872	          much-needed service in the growing shareware market.  They help
  4873	          spread the word about shareware by offering a copying service for
  4874	          those without modems.  They keep up to date with current versions
  4875	          of the best shareware programs on the market.  Many disk vendors
  4876	          offer a free complimentary catalog of products, a toll-free order
  4877	          line, and more.
  4878	
  4879	          A final note: this appendix is "free format".  Disk vendors can
  4880	          say whatever they want if they keep it in the space provided.
  4881	          What you see here is exactly what they told us to write.
  4882	
  4883	          We hope you find this appendix to be useful.

  5529	                              PROGRAMS NO LONGER IN ASP
  5530	
  5531	          The Association of Shareware Professionals, like most organiza-
  5532	          tions, occasionally loses members.  This is a list of shareware
  5533	          products and disk vendors that were at one time covered by ASP's
  5534	          guidelines but are no longer.
  5535	
  5536	          We hope you find this appendix to be useful.
  5537	
  5538	
  5539	          Shareware products
  5540	
  5541	          In some cases, authors voluntarily retire a program and no longer
  5542	          support it.  These authors usually remain in the ASP and, as
  5543	          members, agree to return all money sent in for the product from
  5544	          that point on.
