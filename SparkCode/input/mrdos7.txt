     3	BATCH FILES
     4	-----------
     5	These are user created files that have the extension .BAT
     6	
     7	The file itself contains lines of DOS commands.  Some think of these
     8	files as "macros".  They can be created with an ASCII text editor
     9	including the built in EDLIN editor (see below), or can be created from "the
    10	console" (keyboard) via COPY CON.
    11	
    12	These are very useful for program startups.
    13	
    14	Use the TYPE command to view the contents of a batch file:
    15	
    16	C:\>TYPE 123.BAT
    17	
    18	   c:\
    19	   cd\lotus
    20	   123
    21	   cd\
    22	   cls
    23	
    24	Use the PRINT command to print out the contents of a batch file:
    25	
    26	C:\>PRINT AUTOEXEC.BAT
    27	
    28	The PRINT command is like the TYPE command except it is an external DOS
    29	command and send output to the printer instead of the screen.  Another
    30	approach using redirection discussed earlier would be:
    31	
    32	C:\>TYPE AUTOEXEC.BAT >PRN
    33	
    34	
    35	AUTOEXEC.BAT
    36	------------
    37	This user created, optional batch file is sought out by DOS when the
    38	system is BOOTed.  If this file is on the BOOT disk, DOS will
    39	AUTOmatically open it and EXECute it.
    40	
    41	This is outstanding way to automate the execution of certain DOS
    42	commands like DATE, TIME, PATH, PROMPT, etc - which should be done
    43	EVERY time the system is booted.
    44	
    45	EX:
    46	
    47	          date
    48	          time
    49	          path c:\;c:\dos;c:\batch;c:\utility
    50	          subst e: c:\dbase\dbfiles
    51	          prompt $p$g
    52	          cls
    53

    59	
    60	CONFIG.SYS
    61	----------
    62	This too is an ASCII file created and viewed like AUTOEXEC.bat.  It
    63	also is optional and is sought out by DOS when the system is BOOTed. HOWEVER,
    64	the command lines that this file uses ARE NOT DOS type commands found in .BAT
    65	files.  Rather, these are special CONFIGuration SYStem commands.
    66	
    67	CONFIGuration SYStem commands are needed to define certain hardware
    68	parameters.  For example, if your system uses special size disk drives,
    69	extra printers, extra modems, extra input devices (joysticks, mouse),
    70	RAM disks, etc.
    71	
    72	EX:  CONFIG.sys
    73	
    74	        FILES = 20
    75	        BUFFERS = 15
    76	
    77	In this example, FILES = 20 means that DOS will allow up to 20 files opened
    78	simultaneously.  If this line were not present in CONFIG.SYS, DOS would only
    79	allow up to 7 files.  Do we need up to 20?  Certain programs (dBASE,
    80	Accounting, etc) state early in their manuals that this parameter needs to be
    81	set at 20 for the software to operate correctly.
    82	
    83	The BUFFERS = 15 defines a staging area within RAM for portions of files that
    84	are not on the screen yet.  For example, in an Accounting program if you told
    85	the computer to bring up the last 10 invoices entered, it would display these
    86	10 invoices.  However, unknown to you it actually took the last 30 invoices in
    87	anticipation that you would want to see them right away also.  The extra 20
    88	that the system brought into RAM are sitting within the BUFFERS.  DOS allows
    89	this and does this as a way to speed up the system.  Items that are sitting in
    90	RAM can be accessed seemingly instantly versus items that must be sought from
    91	a disk.
    92	
    93	If not told, DOS automatically sets BUFFERS to 3.  If BUFFERS are so useful,
    94	why not set them to their maximum of 99?  The reason is that DOS is guessing
    95	which information you will need next.  If it guesses wrong - for example the
    96	next invoice you wish to look at is 1500 ago, it must first check all the
    97	BUFFERS before realizing that it will have to go to the disk to retrieve the
    98	needed information.  It actually slows the process down in this case.  Most
    99	purchased software will note if this command is needed and what to set it to.
   100	BUFFERS = 15 is a common level to operate at.
   101	
   102	
   103	EDLIN
   104	-----
   105	Edlin is a LINe EDitor supplied with the DOS disks.  It is a very basic word
   106	processor that allows the creation and editing of Batch Files including
   107	AUTOEXEC.BAT and the CONFIG.SYS file.  These files are like documents that the
   108	computer reads and interprets.  Each line of these files contains a single
   109	thought for the computer.  EDLIN is a device to create these documents.
   110	                                                                                
   111	
   112	
   113	
   114	
   115	
   116	To enter the EDLIN environment you type the word EDLIN followed by the name of
   117	the file you wish to create or edit:
   118	
   119	        C:\>EDLIN CONFIG.SYS
   120	
   121	An asterisk will appear:
   122	
   123	  *
   124	
   125	You will type the letter  I  and press enter to go into the Insert mode:
   126	
   127	  *I
   128	
   129	The computer responds with:
   130	
   131	       1:*
   132	
   133	This 1 refers to line 1 of the CONFIG.SYS you are now creating.  You will now
   134	just type each line and press enter.  When finished you will press the <F6>
   135	key to return to the furthest left asterisk:
   136	
   137	       1:*FILES = 20
   138	       2:*BUFFERS = 15
   139	       3:<F6>
   140	  *
   141	
   142	At this asterisk you will now type  E  and press enter to  End the process and
   143	save what you just created:
   144	
   145	  *E
   146	
   147	C:\>
   148	
   149	Other EDLIN commands from the left most asterisk:
   150	
   151	  *L      - this would List on the screen the entire contents of the
   152	            file being edited
   153	
   154	  *3D     - this would delete line #3 from the file
   155	
   156	  *4I     - this would allow inserting a new command beginning at line #4
   157	
   158	  *5      - this would allow making changes to line #5
   159	
   160	
   161	EDLIN is adequate for creating and editing small Batch type files.  We saw
   162	earlier that there is another technique for creating these files utilizing the
   163	COPY CON  command.  It is even more limited than EDLIN.
   164	
   165	
   166	
   167	BACKUP and RESTORE
   168	------------------
   169	Periodically the entire hard drive or at least the subdirectories
   170	containing data files should be BACKed-UP onto floppies or tape for
   171	safe storage in the event of a hard drive crash or accidental erasure.
   172	
   173	Should that happen, the files are then simply RESTOREd.
   174	                                                                                
   175	
   176	
   177	
   178	
   179	
   180	DOS provides two commands to accomplish this - BACKUP and RESTORE
   181	commands.  Unfortunately, these are slow and problematic.  The world is
   182	full of third party alternatives that are far superior in speed, ease
   183	of use, data compression, and ability to incorporate into batch files
   184	so the operator only need to "kick-off" a batch file and have a supply
   185	of floppies nearby to complete.
   186	
   187	EX: Using DOS commands:
   188	
   189	     C:\>BACKUP C:\lotus\*.wks A:  /S  /M
   190	
   191	"A" is the DESTINATION drive
   192	 C:\lotus  is the SOURCE directory
   193	 *.wks   specifies any files with an extension  .wks  (worksheet files)
   194	
   195	 /S      specifies any Subdirectories beneath \LOTUS directory
   196	         (that contain *.wks files)
   197	
   198	 /M      only the files that have been Modified since Last BACKUP (using the
   199	         same disk set as last used during the BACKUP)
   200	
   201	
   202	NOTE: Have a supply of disks for the "A" drive ready.  These floppies do not
   203	have to be formatted.  If more than 1 is required, be sure to number in
   204	sequence.  This process will erase whatever used to be on the disk.
   205	
   206	Now, if the files need to be restored to the hard drive due to failure
   207	or erasure:   Start out with "disk #1" in the "A" drive.
   208	
   209	     A:\>RESTORE A: C:\lotus\*.wks  /S  /M
   210	
   211	"A" is now the SOURCE
   212	
   213	 /M     only files Modified or Deleted since they were backed up
   214	
   215	
   216	These commands were designed for emergency situations.  It is better than
   217	nothing.  Many wish to use them as a way to transfer a large group of files
   218	from one machine to another.  This will only work if the version of DOS on
   219	each machine is identical.
   220	
   221	Another problem is that you end up with a very large number of disks.  There
   222	is no data compression (which most competing products provide) which results
   223	in up to 50% fewer backup disks.
   224	
   225	A final hazard:  If you end up with 20 disks, and disk number 10 is lost or
   226	destroyed, you may never be able to access disks 11-20 or 1-9.  The 20 disk
   227	set is like one continuous floppy disk.  By destroying 1 disk, it is like you
   228	destroyed the giant continuous floppy.  This is not true of competing products
   229	like FASTBACK, PCTOOLS or NORTON UTILITIES.
   230	                                                                                
   231	
   232	
   233	
   234	
   235	
   236	XCOPY
   237	-----
   238	Beginning with DOS 3.2, the XCOPY command is a useful hybrid of the COPY
   239	command and the BACKUP/RESTORE mess.  It addresses the issue that COPY cannot
   240	copy more files than a disk can hold.  But, XCOPY cannot copy a single file
   241	that is larger than a single disk like the BACKUP command can.
   242	
   243	
   244	C:\>XCOPY C:\*.* a:  /S /M /D:mm-dd-yy
   245	
   246	
   247	The options:   /S    - includes all subdirectories hung from the current one
   248	                       (in the case shown we are in the root directory)
   249	
   250	               /M    - includes only files that have been modified since the
   251	                       last XCOPY was performed
   252	
   253	               /D:mm-dd-yy   - include only files with a date greater or
   254	                               equal to the one specified
   255	
   256	
   257	XCOPY is:   - Faster than the COPY or BACKUP commands
   258	            - Able to transfer entire directories like BACKUP can
   259	            - Copy files selectively by modification status or date
   260	            - Able to use the COPY command (which is DOS version independent)
   261	              to copy individual files at a later date - unlike BACKUP
   262	            - Unable to copy single files that are larger than a single disk
   263	              (BACKUP is able to do this - remember the 1 continuous disk
   264	               concept)
   265	            - Target disks must be formatted
   266	
   267	
   268	HARD DISK ORGANIZATION PRINCIPALS
   269	---------------------------------
   270	
   271	     1. Put only directories in the Root directory except;
   272	        Command.com, Config.sys, Autoexec.bat
   273	
   274	     2. Use many batch files.  Put them in a \BATCH subdirectory
   275	
   276	     3. Keep the PATH command short in autoexec.bat
   277	        PATH = c:\DOS;c:\BATCH;c:\UTILITY
   278	
   279	     4. Keep the directories sorted (use third party software tools)
   280	
   281	     5. Defragment files on a regular basis - use some third party
   282	        software; PC-TOOLS, NORTON UTILITIES, VOPT, etc
   283
