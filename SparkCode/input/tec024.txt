     9	The STACKER device driver, STACKER.COM , requires a modest amount of
    10	resident conventional memory.  The resident size of the Stacker device
    11	driver depends on the Stacker product being used, and on the way
    12	Stacker is configured.  During the initialization phase, as it is
    13	loading and mounting the STACKER drives, it requires slightly more
    14	memory than when resident.
    15	
    16	Refer to the following tables to determine how much memory the Stacker
    17	device driver requires.  These numbers should be used as guidelines.
    18	Once Stacker is installed, observe the STACKER.COM display as the
    19	system starts to see the exact amount of memory the driver is using.
    20	
    21	STACKER 2.0
    22	This table represents memory required for each Stacker product with a
    23	single Stacker drive using 8k clusters.  It also shows the requirements
    24	on a system where Stacker is using EMS memory.  When Stacker is
    25	configured to use available EMS memory, it will use 64k of EMS for its
    26	cache and buffers.

    30	     2.0 Software            26K/(40K)               41K/(47K)
    31	  AT/16, MC/16, XT/8         14K/(40K)               30K/(41K)
    32	
    33	Additional Stacker Drives:
    34	If using more than one Stacker drive, the device driver will consume
    35	slightly more memory to map each additional drive.
    36	
    37	       Product                With EMS              Without EMS
    38	         All                    1.2K                    3 K
    39	
    40	4K vs. 8K Clusters:
    41	A default cluster size of 8k offers better compression than 4k .
    42	However, the device memory required to achieve the better compression
    43	is slightly greater than the 4k option.  With 4k clusters, the base
    44	driver size is reduced by the amount in the table below.
