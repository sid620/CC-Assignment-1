     8	Supra Breaks Price Barrier With Powerful SupraFAXModems 14,400 bps Fax
     9	and Data (V.32bis) Modem for only $399
    10	
    11	ALBANY, OR, January 1992 A wide range of features fax, data, voice,
    12	caller ID, unique status display, small case, and very attractive price
    13	all combine to make the new SupraFAXModem family of modems from Supra
    14	Corporation an intriguing new opportunity for computer users.  The
    15	SupraFAXModem V.32bis features 14,400 bps fax and data for $399.95
    16	retail, and the SupraFAXModem V.32 features 9600 bps fax and data for
    17	$299.95 retail.
    18	
    19	On the fax side, both modems feature Class 1 and 2 commands,
    20	compatibility with Group 3 fax machines, and the ability to send and
    21	receive faxes directly from the computer.  On the data side, both modems
    22	support communication at speeds ranging from 300 bps to 14,400 bps (9600
    23	bps for the SupraFAXModem V.32), plus they also support CCITT V.42bis,
    24	MNP 2-5, and MNP 10 data compression and error correction protocols.
    25	When using V.42bis (4:1 compression), the SupraFAXModem V.32bis provides
    26	up to 57,600 bps throughput, and the SupraFAXModem V.32, up to 38,400
    27	bps throughput.
    28	
    29	Both modems also feature a revolutionary status display, which allows
    30	for an unlimited number of status messages.  In a display that looks
    31	similar to a digital clock, the modems presently give the user up to 25
    32	different messages, conveying things like connection rate and type (FX),
    33	dialing (DI), ringing (RI), and transmission error (TE). This display is
    34	a great advantage compared with most other modems, whose finite number
    35	of indicator lights limit how much information they can convey to the
    36	user.
    37	
    38	All of these features are packed into a case about the size of two decks
    39	of playing cards placed side by side (1" x 4.5" x 6.5") a case that is
    40	half the size of many other V.32 and V.32bis modems.
    41	
    42	All that's needed to use an external SupraModem is a computer
    43	(or terminal) with an RS-232C interface, communications software, and a
    44	cable to connect the modem to the computer.  Everything else is
    45	included:  the modem, operatorUs manual, quick-reference card, power
    46	adapter, and telephone cable.
    47	
    48	Voice & Caller ID
    49	
    50	SupraFAXModems also support two important features voice and caller ID
    51	that can be enabled through low-cost, user-installable firmware upgrades
    52	available mid-1992. The voice feature allows the modems to send and
    53	receive digitized voice and implement several voice functions.  The
    54	modems can compress and uncompress voice data for efficient storage,
    55	generate and recognize touch tones, and sample at various frequencies,
    56	depending on the quality level desired.  This feature will be useful for
    57	interactive applications such as voice mail, answering machines, and
    58	digital announcers. Caller ID (where available) allows the number from
    59	which an incoming call was dialed to be displayed on the user's screen
    60	before the call is answered. This will be useful for secure
    61	communications, automatic identification of incoming calls, and
    62	interactive voice applications.
    63	
    64	Innovation & Chip Sets Combine For Killer Pricing At $299.95 and $399.95
    65	retail, respectively, the SupraFAXModem V.32 and SupraFAXModem V.32bis
    66	are about 1/2 to 1/3 the price of similar modems.  Supra is able to
    67	offer these prices because of innovative designs and state-of-the-art
    68	chip sets from Rockwell International.
    69	
    70	"We are very excited about the power we're putting into our customers'
    71	hands, and the outstanding quality we are able to deliver at these very
    72	affordable prices," said John Wiley, President of Supra Corporation.
    73	
    74	In addition to the stand-alone modems, packages that include cables and
    75	software will be available for IBM PC and Macintosh computers.  IBM PC
    76	internal models will also be available.
    77	
    78	About Supra Corporation
    79	
    80	Supra Corporation, based in Albany, Oregon, has been providing personal
    81	computer users with high-quality, low-cost peripherals since 1985.  The
    82	SupraFAXModems (including the previously announced 9600 bps fax/2400 bps
    83	data SupraFAXModem Plus) are the latest additions to the popular
    84	SupraModem family. Since the original SupraModem 2400 was introduced in
    85	1987, SupraModems have been popular among consumers looking for
    86	excellent value in a reliable modem, and have been recommended by a
    87	variety of sources, from respected PC Magazine and MacUser columnist
    88	John C. Dvorak to the Berkeley Macintosh User's Group (BMUG). In
    89	addition to manufacturing a complete line of fax and data modems, Supra
    90	makes a variety of peripherals for Commodore Amiga computers.
