     1	Regarding the file "24to96.zip", which "explains" how to increase the speed
     2	of a 2400 baud modem to 9600:
     3	
     4	THIS FILE IS EITHER A HOAX OR ABSOLUTELY THE WORST TECHNICAL DOCUMENT EVER
     5	WRITTEN.    DON'T TRY IT!!!!!!
     6	
     7	In my opinion, it originated as a hoax, but since I know of two cases where
     8	it has resulted in the destruction of perfectly good 2400 bps modems, I
     9	thought I would write up this "rebuttal", and encourage all to ignore the
    10	24to96 file, as well as remove it from the BBS's it has shown up on.
    11	
    12	The problem with this type of "joke" is, unless the reader is fairly
    13	technical and knows something about chips and especially about modems, it
    14	almost sounds as though it would work!  That has been true in the two cases
    15	I know of.  The instructions sounded plausible to a couple of newcomers to
    16	electronics, and caused them to open up their modems, and when they found a
    17	slight match between their modems construction and the 24to96 instructions,
    18	they jumped in and hacked away.  The fact that these files were retrieved
    19	from BBS's with solid reputations for policing the quality and authenticity
    20	of the files gave the experimenter's confidence they would not have felt had
    21	they retrieved the data from the National Enquirer! In addition, overly
    22	enthusiastic uploaders have added testimonials to the explanation of the file
    23	(maybe to enhance the joke?) such as "I've tried this and it really works!". 
    24	If they have, they should contact me, and we will start up another company to
    25	build 9600 modems this new and revolutionary way which will surely blow all
    26	competitors away, since the chips listed are 1/6th the cost of the next
    27	cheapest 9600 bps chip set.
    28	
    29	Lest you wonder why I think I know so much about this, my credentials: 
    30	
    31	degree: BS Electronics Engineering/Mathematics, AAA ranked University
    32	20+ years engineering experience
    33	7 years modem design experience
    34	have designed 40+ modems using the chips in the 24to96 file
    35	founder of three modem companies now in business
    36	
    37	[haven't bragged that much in 20 years!]
    38	
    39	Specific problems in "24to96" (other than horrible english and grammar):
    40	
    41	(1) The INTEL part numbers called out are not INTEL part numbers.  They are
    42	probably manufacturer's part numbers for a particular Hayes clone modem, but,
    43	they could just as easily be spare tires for a volvo motorcycle!
    44	
    45	(2) The SC11005 chip called out in the instructions is also not an INTEL
    46	number; it is a SIERRA number.  Specifically, it is a SIERRA V.22 bis modem
    47	filter (don't recall all the exact specs).
    48	
    49	(3) They instruct you to remove the SIERRA SC11005 chip and replace it with
    50	an SC11020.  In the first place, the SC11020 is essentially a custom
    51	microprocessor (not a filter of any sort), in the second place, the SC11020
    52	has about twice as many pins as the SC11005!  Not to mention it uses
    53	different power supply connections and voltages and may possible blow up if
    54	you could get it rigged in just right.  An experienced technician would
    55	notice that right off, but again, some have just enough experience to feel
    56	they can do this, but do not realize what is going on until they have already
    57	hacked the SC11005 (or some other part) out of the modem (if they even FOUND
    58	one in the first place!).
    59	
    60	(4) To the best of my knowledge, there is no way to upgrade a V.22bis modem
    61	to any kind of 9600 bps modem no matter what you do.  It is not a matter of
    62	"bandwidth".
    63	
    64	(5) I tried unsuccessfully for 4 years to buy chips from US Robotics.  Why
    65	would they sell cheap upgrades instead of expensive HST modems?
    66	
    67	(6) "Optional Lap-M error correction".  
    68	    This is the only part of the instructions that won't hurt your modem,
    69	though it is definitely NOT V.42 anything.  You may recognize this as the
    70	"noise filter" circuit explained in a number of BBS files over the past
    71	couple of years.
    72	    Since Lap-M error correction is a SOFTWARE function, it goes without
    73	saying that you cannot add Lap-M error correction to a modem simply by adding
    74	a series RC network between tip and ring on the phone jack!
    75	    To add Lap-M error correction requires the addition of software requiring
    76	thousands of man hours to write and debug, and a microprocessor capable of
    77	executing the software in real time.  At 9600 bps this is no small
    78	requirement!
    79	
    80	(7) A 9600 bps modem requires support circuitry at least 10 times better
    81	(higher quality, lower distortion, better echo-canceling, etc.) than 2400 bps
    82	modems.  Dropping a 9600 bps modem chip set into a 2400 design would barely
    83	function and would probably fail miserably in actual use, provided of course
    84	such a thing were even possible.
    85	           **************************************************
    86	Now, if you had already figured out this file was a joke, Congratulations! 
    87	You are officially designated a technical sophisticrat! But, remember, most
    88	modem users are not technical and will not be able to see through this as
    89	easily as you did.  If two people who knew me and could call for help have
    90	ruined modems over this irresponsible document, how many others did also, and
    91	could not call for help?  (BTW, another guy mentioned to me he was going to
    92	try it and I talked him out of it--that makes three I know of).  This is a
    93	reckless joke, and I consider it a "HARDWARE VIRUS" document; those who
    94	originate and promote such things are no better than those who write and
    95	spread viruses.
    96	
    97	If you had not seen through this document, I am glad you took the time to
    98	download and read this.  Please, NO MATTER HOW MUCH SENSE THIS ALL MAKES TO
    99	YOU, DO NOT TRY TO DISASSEMBLE AND UPGRADE YOUR MODEM USING THESE
   100	INSTRUCTIONS!  In fact, even if you  managed to add V.42bis to your modem
   101	somehow, unless you purchase a license from IBM, UniSys and British Telecom
   102	to use it, IT WOULD BE PIRATED SOFTWARE AND YOU WOULD BE A SOFTWARE PIRATE. 
   103	V.42/bis is owned and licensed by IBM, UniSys and British Telecom; their
   104	license fees are substantial and are included in the cost of a V.42/bis
   105	capable modem.
   106	
   107	If you still want to try it, at least find a friend or solicit the help of a
   108	student or ???  They won't be able to do the upgrade either, but maybe THEY
   109	can convince you this is baloney!
   110	
   111	
   112	I don't usually "go public" this directly.  When I first read this file I
   113	thought it was intended to be serious.  When I read it again I knew it was
   114	obviously a joke.  When people started taking it seriously and suffering from
   115	it I became angry.  I ought to actually publish instructions for upgrading
   116	from 2400 bps to 9600 bps.  I think it would parallel the recipe I once
   117	learned for cooking common lake Carp (a "trash" fish in the U.S.):
   118	
   119	           Clean the Carp
   120	           Lay it out flat on a redwood shingle
   121	           Generously season with salt, pepper and dill
   122	           Place in a 400 degree oven and cook for 3 hours
   123	
   124	           To eat, throw away the carp and eat the shingle!
   125	
   126	The modem instructions would be:
   127	
   128	           Remove all interior components from your 2400 bps modem
   129	           Retain the case, power switch and lights
   130	           Put the 9600 bps sub-section you purchased into the case
   131	           Screw it down and connect up the switch and the lights
   132	           Throw out the 2400 bps modem
   133	
   134	Well, that's about it.  I've done my bit for the modem world, saved it from
   135	a terrible fate, right?
   136	
   137	Well, maybe not...............
