    15	"What applications that require ISDN can't already run with existing
    16	products like switched 56 kbit, and 14,400 modems?"
    17	
    18	Switched 56 kilobit service has the same order of bandwidth as 64 kbit
    19	ISDN, but its availability is strikingly different.  Switched 56 is not
    20	intended to be a residential service.  Our vision of ISDN is that you
    21	simply order it the way you order an additional voice-grade phone line.
    22	Further, we believe ISDN must be priced like voice telephone service.
    23	Switched 56 is not priced like voice service.  It is much more
    24	expensive.  ISDN must be ubiquitous and affordable.  Switched 56, while
    25	useful for businesses which can afford expensive installation and fees
    26	is not.
    27	
    28	The ISDN rate of 64 kb is at the critical threshold which will permit
    29	interactive multimedia using video and audio compression.  14.4 is
    30	simply too slow, even with compression, for videotelephony, much less
    31	other more demanding forms of video.  Before it is argued that the
    32	effective rate of a V.32bis modem is not 14.4 kb, but 14.4 kb plus
    33	compression effects, let me point out that the same compression
    34	techniques can and will be applied over 64 kb ISDN lines, boosting its
    35	effective rate by an equivalent factor of two to four.
    36	
    37	While it is still considered heretical in some quarters to assert that
    38	VHS-quality video will be possible over a 64 kb line, there is a growing
    39	consensus among researchers at the cutting edge of work in this area
    40	that that is exactly where we are headed.  In such a scenario, using
    41	desktop personal computers of the year 1995 as video production studios,
    42	everyone with access to a PC and ISDN potentially becomes a video
    43	producer, with ISDN as the switched distribution network providing video
    44	dial-tone.  This will open the floodgates of innovation in video,
    45	acheiving the richness of video (not passive, but interactive) with the
    46	type of diversity heretofore associated only with print.
    47	
    48	Beyond ISDN are other protocols which can run over copper-pairs, such as
    49	ADSL, which runs at 300 kb /second.  More on that later.

   141	Subject: Initial Positive Response to the Open Platform Proposal
   142	From: mkapor (Mitch Kapor)
   143	Sender: ckd
   144	
   145	The initial response to the Open Platform concept has been extremely
   146	positive in many quarters.
   147	
   148	1. Congress 
   149	 
   150	In a letter to Mitchell Kapor from the Chairman of the Subcommittee with
   151	primarily jurisdiction over telecommunications policy dated November 5,
   152	1991,  Representative  Edward J. Markey complemented Mitchell Kapor on his
   153	"insights on the development of a national public information
   154	infrastructure" which "were appreciated greatly by myself and the Members
   155	of the Subcommittee." 
   156	
   157	Chairman Markey, writing to Mitch Kapor as a representative of the computer
   158	industry, called for other leaders in the industry to participate more
   159	actively in the policy process.  The letter states:
   160	
   161	"In crafting the right policies [for the telephone network], the assistance
   162	of you and your colleagues in the computer industry is critical if we are
   163	to bring the benefits of advanced information technology to the American
   164	public.  As I said at the hearing, we need to pursue policies that
   165	encourage the Bell companies to work with other sectors of the
   166	communications industry to create a consumer-oriented, public information
   167	network. Please let me or my staff know what policies you and others in the
   168	computer industry believe would best serve the public interest in creating
   169	a reasonably priced, widely available network in which competition is open
   170	and innovation rewarded.  I also want to learn what lessons from the
   171	computer industry over the past ten to fifteen years should apply to the
   172	current debate on structuring the information and communications networks
   173	of the future....I ask your help in gaining input from the computer
   174	industry so that the Subcommittee can shape policies that will bring this
   175	spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship to the information services
   176	industry.  
   177	
   178	Key members on the Senate Commerce Committee have also expressed serious
   179	interest in the proposal and for it to be further developed in cooperation
   180	with others in the computer industry.  We have agreed to reach out to
   181	leaders in the computer industry such as yourself to obtain your input and
   182	seek your participation in this policy process.
   183	
   184	
   185	2. Communications Industry
   186	
   187	Since unveiling the proposal, Mitchell Kapor and Jerry Berman, EFF's
   188	Washington Office Director, have met with top officials of many of the
   189	communications and electronic publishing firms involved in the current
   190	debate, including the American Newspaper Publishers Association, the
   191	National Cable Television Association, Dun and Bradstreet, AT&T, and the
   192	Electronic Publishers Association.  All have expressed enthusiasm about the
   193	Open Platform concept and have urged that we develop the proposal in more
   194	detail.  They want to know if it is both economically and technically
   195	feasible to deploy a feature rich ISDN or whether innovation must await the
   196	full and costly deployment of  residential fiber optics.
   197	
   198	
   199	3. Consumer Groups
   200	
   201	On November 25, 1991 the Communications Policy Forum, a consumer forum
   202	cosponsored by the Consumer Federation of American, the Electronic Frontier
   203	Foundation, and the American Civil Liberties Union, met to discuss the
   204	future of telecommunications policy in the wake of the court's decision to
   205	permit the RBOCS to engage in information services.  At this meeting, EFF
   206	presented the Open Platform Proposal as a necessary part of any legislation
   207	that seeks both to establish fair competition as well as innovative health,
   208	education, and other information services.   Consumer groups expressed
   209	great interest in the idea and called on EFF to develop its concept further
   210	and to use the Communications Policy Forum as a mechanism for developing a
   211	more detailed open platform design for further consumer review in early
   212	1992.

   227	[Tim Gorman <71336.1270@compuserve.com> provides the following useful
   228	tutorial on ISDN in the telephone network. -MK]
   229	 
   230	Probably the first comment that needs to be made about ISDN availability is
   231	the capability of the network to provide the service. There are several
   232	pieces of the network involved in providing the service and all must be
   233	available or none of the rest are useful. Basically these consist of:
   234	    1. local subscriber outside plant facilities
   235	        a. copper pairs
   236	        b. Subscriber carrier (either copper or fiber based)
   237	    2. Central Office line card modules (and corresponding line cards)
   238	    3. Central office line concentrating modules (primarily software)
   239	    4. Central office interoffice trunk modules
   240	    5. Central office switch generics
   241	 
   242	 
   243	Central office
   244	---------------
   245	 
   246	First, some generic background on central office switch architecture is
   247	needed. For the most part, the following descriptions apply to all
   248	digital central offices regardless of vendor.

   272	 
   273	The line card module, concentrating module, and switch fabric module are
   274	all
   275	smart, highly sophisticated pieces of equipment. Although some call them
   276	"multiplexing" equipment, in essence they are all dedicated purpose
   277	computers. As such, they all have software (or firmware or whatever is
   278	appropriate to the vendors architecture and jargon) which dictate their
   279	operation. In many cases, this software is arranged as various packages or
   280	"features" that are licensed (via a right-to-use fee) from the vendor.
   281	These
   282	software features include software for the various module operations as
   283	well
   284	as for the CPU "generic" software. ISDN functionality is usually included
   285	as
   286	one or more of these features (e.g. basic ISDN, D-channel packet, D-channel
   287	backup could all be different feature packages).
   288	 
   289	There may be multiple physical variants of each module for use in providing
   290	different serving arrangements in different switches. These may also many
   291	times be distinguished by different pricing levels. At least one vendor has
   292	available a standard, analog line card/line drawer/line frame module and a
   293	different ISDN, 2B1Q compatible line card/line drawer/line frame module.
   294	The
   295	2B1Q ISDN line frame module is to be upgraded in 1992 to be physically and
   296	software compatible with all standard analog line cards as well as the ISDN
   297	2B1Q line cards.
   298	 
   299	 
   300	Network
   301	-----------
   302	 
   303	Making ISDN a viable service will require providing the right physical
   304	equipment and software in the network. Individual physical pieces that
   305	will need to be considered are:
   306	 
   307	    a. line terminating equipment
   308	    b. interoffice trunking equipment (for 64kb clear channel signaling)
   309	    c. interoffice facilities (for 64kb clear channel signaling)
   310	    d. subscriber loop carrier equipment
   311	 
   312	 
   313	It is probable that most existing line terminating equipment is not ISDN
   314	capable. The primary reason in most cases will probably have to do with the
   315	need for splitting off the D-channel signaling and routing it through the
   316	switch to the necessary processing modules. Most existing line module
   317	equipment just doesn't provide for this. This does, of course, depend on
   318	the switch vendors equipment design.
   319	 
   320	Most trunk interface module equipment now in use is not 64kb clear channel
   321	signaling capable. For at least two major switch vendors, making the
   322	equipment capable will not require provisioning new equipment modules but
   323	will require adding "common equipment" to the existing modules. The common
   324	equipment consists of additional plug-in boards providing the necessary
   325	functionality. The major problem with this upgrade is the complexity of
   326	adding these plug-ins. If you have a trunk interface module that handles
   327	twenty DS-1 lines and they are all in service only two approaches are
   328	available. You can obtain "turn-down releases" on all of the circuits,
   329	busy them out, perform appropriate maintenance activity on the interface
   330	module, add the new circuit packs, download any needed software to the
   331	trunk interface peripheral, and then reverse the previous steps to put the
   332	circuits back in service. The alternative is to provide a "conversion"
   333	trunk interface module (properly equipped of course), transition all DS-1
   334	lines from the next module to be converted to the conversion module,
   335	convert
   336	the just vacated one, and then continue the process with the next module in
   337	line and the one that was just converted. Both methods are VERY manpower
   338	intensive and therefore expensive to perform. It is also not a quick
   339	process
   340	in terms of overall interval. Manpower must be allocated to this task when
   341	other, higher priority service-impacting activities are not pending.
   342	 
   343	Providing full ISDN capability in the interoffice facility network is much
   344	like providing it in the central office trunk interface modules.
   345	Multiplexing
   346	equipment, fiber terminating bays, line repeaters, etc. must be changed out
   347	or upgraded. The major complicating factor here is the number of circuits
   348	that can be involved and the resulting service impacts.
   349	 
   350	Subscriber Loop Carrier
   351	--------------------------
   352	 
   353	Subscriber Loop Carrier (SLC) was developed to take advantage of DS1
   354	signaling to save outside plant investment. By using two pairs to provide
   355	a DS1 span with a capability of 24 circuits, a savings of 22 pairs could be
   356	realized. Most Subscriber Loop Carrier (SLC) equipment being provided today
   357	operates much in the same fashion as standard T-1 equipment. This means
   358	each
   359	individual module provides some kind of grouping of 24 56kb lines.
   360	Different
   361	vendors provide different line capacities such as AT&T's SLC-96 (tm?)
   362	equipment. In order to provide full ISDN capability the equipment must
   363	first
   364	be upgraded to provide 64kb channel service instead of 56kb. Then the
   365	appropiate plug-in cards must be installed to interface with the actual
   366	pair
   367	going toward the subscribers location. The major concern in this serving
   368	arrangement will be the impact on equipment quantities. To serve 2B+D at a
   369	160kb rate will probably require three channels (64kb * 3 = 192kb) on the
   370	SLC module. A large penetration of ISDN could result in having to increase
   371	equipment investment to a level of about three times what it is now. Some
   372	investigation also is needed to determine if ISDN and standard analog lines
   373	can co-exist on the same SLC module. If not, even a small penetration of
   374	ISDN could result in a large requirement for additional equipment.
   375	 
   376	Generic SLC architecture looks as follows:
   377	 
   378	                                                                        24

   392	 
   393	 
   394	The arrangement shown here is what is generically termed "dedicated" mode.
   395	Each subscriber has a channel to the switch available at all times. Most
   396	vendors offer enough intelligence in their terminals (usually via
   397	additional
   398	plug-ins) to also provide concentration ratio's ranging from 48 subscribers
   399	vying for 24 channels (2:1) to as high as 5:1. This would mean that of the
   400	120 customers connected to the remote terminal, only 24 could have calls in
   401	progress at once.
   402	 
   403	One primary reason for for SLC equipment not being exactly like standard T1
   404	systems is the need to provide for additional signaling modes required in
   405	the
   406	loop plant. Interoffice trunk signaling generally uses what is termed
   407	2-State
   408	signaling. The far end can signal you as either off-hook or on-hook
   409	(busy/idle, seizure/idle, etc.) Similarly, you can signal the far end an
   410	off-hook or on-hook. Physically, this signaling can take many forms: loop
   411	closed/loop open, battery reversal/normal battery, E lead ground/E lead
   412	open,
   413	etc. Basic station service typically uses 3-State signaling from the
   414	Central
   415	Office (CO) toward the station and 2-State from the station to the CO. The
   416	CO
   417	needs to signal battery applied to the line, battery not applied to the
   418	line,
   419	and alerting (usually ringing voltage). Special stations such as ground
   420	start
   421	lines or coin lines can use 3-State signaling or even higher (the CO needs
   422	to signal a coin station for coin collect, coin return, dialing pad enable,
   423	dialing pad disable, and ringing among others). This requires the SLC
   424	equipment to encode the signaling information in the PCM bitstream
   425	differently than standard T1.
   426	 
   427	As an enhancement to this service, some switch vendors make what is termed
   428	"integrated" SLC modules for their switches. All this really does is take
   429	the
   430	central office terminal and integrate it directly into the switch
   431	architecture. The DS1 lines from the remote terminal can then be terminated
   432	directly on the central office switch. This architecture has never "caught
   433	on" in this area because of the difficulty in maintaining load balance
   434	objectives (i.e. you can't move a high usage line to a low usage line
   435	interface module to keep switch usage in balance without moving at least
   436	23 other customers).

   474	Instead of the fiber shown in this drawing, digital radio or cable based
   475	T1,
   476	T1C, and T2 may be used in the interoffice plant.
   477	 
   478	Each piece of equipment in this arrangement must be capable of 64kb clear
   479	channel signaling or it cannot be made available on an end-to-end basis.
   480	For
   481	service protection, the trunk paths between two end points are usually
   482	spread over as wide a range of equipment as possible. Thus, providing 64kb
   483	clear
   484	channel capability for certain interoffice connections may involve updating
   485	a significant amount of equipment in the central office.

   503	
   504	
   505	> [Tim Gorman <71336.1270@compuserve.com> provides the following useful
   506	> tutorial on ISDN in the telephone network. -MK]
   507	
   508	Tim left off the subscriber end, perhaps because this is more common
   509	knowledge.  But I'll fill it in anyway...
   510	    
   511	Everyone knows that ISDN carries synchronous 2B+D, and that each B is
   512	64Kbps packet or circuit switched, and the D is 16Kbps packet
   513	switched.  Synchronous means that the data is constantly flowing at
   514	the specified rate.  Most modems in use today use asynchronous
   515	transmission, which means that each chunk of information has a
   516	starting indication and an ending indication.
   517	
   518	Packet switched means that the stream of bits is formatted
   519	into packets, and each packet is transported as a unit.  Circuit
   520	switched means that the stream of bits goes from one end to another
   521	without being interpreted by the switching equipment.
   522	
   523	There are two different flavors of 2B+D: U and T.  ANSI has defined
   524	two different interfaces in the customer's premises, T (or S/T) and U.
   525	The U interface connects directly to the switch over a 0 to 18,000 foot
   526	loop, and uses one pair.  The T interface connects to the U interface
   527	through a signal converter called an NT1.  It uses two pair (transmit and
   528	receive) and runs at most 1,000 feet.
   529	
   530	The U interface is electrically more sophisticated.  The transmission
   531	rate is 80Kbaud and each pair of bits is encoded into four different
   532	voltage levels.  This makes the data rate 160Kbps, plus it transmits
   533	and receives in both directions at the same time.  It does this by
   534	knowing what it's sending, and subtracting that from what it's
   535	receiving.  Then it digitally filters the result.  This is necessary
   536	because the local loop to your premises may contain multiple changes
   537	in impedance.  That happens when your wire gauge changes, or you have
   538	a tee connection.  These impedance changes muddy the digital signal.
   539	
   540	There can be only one device on the U interface, most probably an NT1.
   541	The T interface, on the other hand, can be shared between multiple
   542	devices.  This is done because you can hang a telephone, a modem, and
   543	a FAX machine off the same phone line.  When a FAX machine calls you,
   544	your FAX machine answers.  When a modem calls you, your modem answers,
   545	etc.
   546	
   547	There are three concerns with ISDN:
   548	
   549	  o Powering
   550	  o Wiring
   551	  o Extensions
   552	
   553	Powering
   554	
   555	The current telephone network (POTS -- Plain Old Telephone Service
   556	[seriously]) is powered by the central office.  Ever notice that your
   557	phone has a "REN"?  That stands for Ringer Equivalence Number.  It's
   558	given in units of the standard telephone bell.  Your central office
   559	can ring about five of these bells.  If the total of all your RENs is
   560	over five, then your phone may not ring.
   561	
   562	ISDN, on the other hand, uses no power from the central office.  That seems
   563	like an advantage, but what happens when you lose local power.  The central
   564	office still runs because it has its own batteries.  But you can't make
   565	calls unless you have your ISDN sets on a UPS.
   566	
   567	Wiring
   568	
   569	POTS phones can and have been wired willy-nilly, in a star configuration,
   570	or bus.  Because only two wires are necessary, sometimes only two wires
   571	work.
   572	
   573	ISDN, on the other hand, requires a single stretch of wire with terminators
   574	on both ends, and it requires four wires.
   575	
   576	Extensions
   577	
   578	POTS sets can join into an existing phone call simply by going off hook.
   579	Only one ISDN set can communicate on a B channel at a time.  That means
   580	that only the originating or receiving set can communicate.  All the
   581	other sets cannot transmit or receive.
   582	
   583	--russ <nelson@clutx.clarkson.edu> I'm proud to be a humble Quaker.
   584	Peace is not the absence of war.  Peace is the presence of a system for
   585	resolving conflicts before war becomes necessary.  War never creates peace.

   598	Subject: Article on "The Argument Against ISDN"
   599	
   600	...Let's set the mirrors aside and see what we really have with ISDN:
   601	 ISDN provides 64 kilobit digital, full-duplex data. It does so to any
   602	 other ISDN line when using a carrier that is fully digital, compatible
   603	 and offers the service.
   604	 ISDN provides point-to-point connections, similar to a telephone.
   605	 Connections can be established in a few seconds.
   606	 ISDN provides several enhanced features, such as calling line 
   607	 identification and data privacy....
   608	Telephone companies invariably fear new technology.... New technology
   609	upsets rate structures. And new technology upsets *the natural order of 
   610	things.*
   611	ISDN is a new technology.... ISDN represents competition to local 
   612	dialtone loops.... There are many questions. The traditional telco 
   613	response is simple: Charge a high enough price that these concerns 
   614	simply go away because of the profits generated....
   615	implementation of ISDN has involved changing out central office lines. 
   616	Designing $1000 boxes for the customer end. It has meant converting the 
   617	*entire* public nationwide network to an all-digital one. In short, ISDN 
   618	was designed to take more than a decade to implement....
   619	ISDN has some serious "reality checks" to go through to succeed. And
   620	unless it can pass that reality check, it will be increasingly a fantasy. 
   621	Back when it was just a dream, it might have made sense to charge twice 
   622	as much for an ISDN call....
   623	But today, modems are equally fast, and thus ISDN *cannot* cost more per 
   624	minute if it is to succeed in the mainstream marketplace.
   625	Because not everybody has ISDN lines to every desktop, ISDN has less 
   626	effective connectivity than a modem. And this, too, reduces the value of 
   627	ISDN.
   628	Because telephone companies are in no position to prevent independent 
   629	competitive technology from being introduced, they will have to compete. 
   630	The cost of installing an ISDN line must be low.... The cost of ISDN 
   631	terminal equipment must be lowered....
   632	What can be done to preserve the potential benefits of ISDN's ubiquitous 
   633	digital service...?
   634	ISDN is better suited for some types of data than modems will be for 
   635	perhaps another five years.... ISDN achieves its 64,000 bits per second 
   636	speed *without* compression. This could be a tellingly significant 
   637	point.... ISDN can combine a voice line with a data line for 
   638	simultaneous use. This can eliminate the need for a second line....
   639	ISDN, being a network service, may combine to offer X.25-like capability. 
   640	This means that a single ISDN termination could maintain many 
   641	simultaneous "virtual" connections through a packet-switched network....
   642	To widely succeed, ISDN needs an aggressive posture. Terminal equipment 
   643	costs must be affordable(or lower), per minute rate charges must be 
   644	comparable(or lower), and efforts need to be made to achieve 
   645	compatability with existing software.
   646	Otherwise, ISDN will merely service your Group IV FAX machine and your 
   647	desktop video system. Maybe this is enough for your telephone company. 
   648	But is it really enough for you?...

   667	From: <frankston!Bob_Frankston@world.std.com> (by way of mkapor@eff.org (Mitch
   668	 Kapor))
   669	Subject: Re: What is ISDN Good For?
   670	
   671	
   672	It seems that the main attribute of interest in ISDN is the (relatively)
   673	high 
   674	bandwidth.  Actually, this it is modest compared with other media (such as 
   675	cable TV and newspapers), but still better than standard phone lines.
   676	
   677	But there are other aspects that I'm more concerned about including:
   678	
   679	* Ideally, ISDN should provide peer protocols between my premises equipment
   680	
   681	and the central offices in terms of controlling connections and accessing 
   682	network resources.  I should also be able to provide services.  A simple 
   683	example is call forwarding -- I should be able to implement this locally.  
   684	One advantage of a local implementation is the ability to add policies.  
   685	These protocols should support queries about pricing and other service 
   686	aspects.
   687	
   688	* For data transmission I need to be able to connect to multiple services 
   689	using either a datagram capability or multiple virtual circuits.  This
   690	should 
   691	be a standard offering so that I can build software that takes advantage of
   692	
   693	it.
   694	
   695	* Addressing (phone number) issues should be cleaned up over the current 
   696	system so that I have a uniform way of addressing resources on the network.
   697	 
   698	I.e., no dial "9" for an outside line.  But this should be extended to 
   699	subaddressing as in specifying an extension number, a person or service.  
   700	This is similar to DID but universal without the high costs of a DID trunk.
   701	
   702	This is extending the view of what ISDN is.  For example, I should be able
   703	to 
   704	use standard ISDN protocols to pass the additional data bits to a pager. 
   705	(Of 
   706	course, the character set should be Unicode and not just digits).
   707	
   708	* Of course, pricing should be such that casual connection to network 
   709	services for many hours should be comparable to the price for an unmeasured
   710	
   711	service line.  The current message unit pricing assumes that the use of the
   712	
   713	phone is an unusual event.  If it is our connection to the communications 
   714	infrastructure then the default is to be connected and use of a modest size
   715	
   716	information pipe should be negligible  Perhaps a better price comparison 
   717	would be to the newspaper.  Getting the newspaper delivered via ISDN should
   718	
   719	not cost more than getting some ink laden woodpulp hand carried to my
   720	house.
   721	
   722	In reading the notes about the physical wiring for ISDN, I'm concerned
   723	about 
   724	ISDN being an MIS manager dream and an end user's Procrustean bed.

   802	It's overstated.  The time for instllation varies between one week to
   803	six months depending on the area, the availability of the digital
   804	exchanges.  And you have to pay an instllation fee of about $100 -
   805	$150.  Futermore, the monthly charge becomes twice of the analog
   806	telephone: ie, about $35.

   863	U.S. SAID TO PLAY FAVORITES IN PROMOTING NATIONWIDE COMPUTER NETWORK
   864	By John Markoff
   865	c.1991 N.Y. Times News Service
   866	
   867	   Just one week after President Bush signed legislation calling for the
   868	creation of a nationwide computer data "superhighway," a debate has erupted
   869	over whether the government gave an unfair advantage to a joint venture of
   870	IBM and MCI that built and manages a key part of the network.
   871	   The IBM-MCI venture, known as Advanced Network and Services, manages a
   872	network called NSFnet, which connects hundreds of research centers and
   873	universities. NSFnet also manages links to dozens of other countries. All
   874	these networks are collectively known as Internet.
   875	   Some private competitors say Advanced Network and Services uses its
   876	favored position to squeeze them out of the data-transmission market by
   877	establishing rules that make it difficult to connect to NSFnet.
   878	   NSFnet was founded by the National Science Foundation, a federal agency,
   879	and is composed of leased telephone lines that link special computers
   880	called routers, which transmit packages of data to three million users in
   881	33 countries. Data traffic over the NSFnet backbone has doubled in the last
   882	year.
   883	   The government wants to develop a national data highway for electronic
   884	commerce, digital video transmissions to homes and vast electronic
   885	libraries that could be drawn on by the nation's schools.
   886	   Advanced Network and Services, based in Elmsford, N.Y., was set up last
   887	year as a non-profit corporation with $10 million from International
   888	Business Machines Corp. and MCI Communications Corp.  Earlier this year it
   889	set up a for-profit subsidiary, called ANS CO+RE, to sell computer network
   890	services.  That led some competitors to complain that Advanced Network and
   891	Services would be able to compete unfairly because of its arrangement with
   892	the government.
   893	   People involved in planning for a national data network say it is
   894	essential to provide for fair competition, which will lead rival companies
   895	to offer creative and entrepreneurial services in the hope of building
   896	market share. Without competiton, they say, the government will have
   897	created a monopoly that has little incentive to innovate.
   898	   "This is the first major communication business to be born under the
   899	deregulation era," said David Farber, a computer scientist at the
   900	University of Pennsylvania and a pioneer in data networking. "This hasn't
   901	happened since the growth of the telephone industry. You want it to be a
   902	business that doesn't repeat the errors of the past."
   903	   In recent years, the National Science Foundation has tried to shift its
   904	operations and ownership of NSFnet to Advanced Network and Services. And it
   905	will try to establish competition through contracts for networks to compete
   906	with NSFnet next year.
   907	   But there is no level playing field, complained William L.  Schrader,
   908	president of Performance Systems International Inc., a Reston, Va., company
   909	that provides commercial data connections to Internet.
   910	   He made public two letters between officials of Advanced Network and
   911	Services and the National Science Foundation that he said gave the company
   912	unfair control over access to the network. The result, he added, was that
   913	the government turned over valuable public property to a private company.
   914	   "It's like taking a federal park and giving it to Kmart," Schrader said.
   915	"It's not right, and it isn't going to stand. As a taxpayer, I think it's
   916	disgusting."
   917	   Performance Systems and several other companies have set up an
   918	alternative to NSFnet, known as a CIX.
   919	   Schrader said his company and the venture of IBM and MCI were competing
   920	for the same customers but unlike his rival he lacked a federal subsidy. He
   921	said he might ask the Internal Revenue Service to look at the business
   922	relationship between Advanced Network's non-profit and for-profit
   923	operations.
   924	   Allan Weis, the president of Advanced Network, disputed that his company
   925	had an unfair advantage. "It's a very competitive environment right now,"
   926	he said. "We have lost quite a few bids to PSI and to other competitors as
   927	well."
   928	   At the National Science Foundation, Stephen Wolff, director of its
   929	networking division, said IBM and MCI had overbuilt the network and were
   930	selling commercial service based on the excess capacity that was available.
   931	   A number of organizations are working informally to settle the dispute.
   932	   "I think it's a mess," said Mitchell D. Kapor, the founder of Lotus
   933	Development Corp. and now head of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a
   934	public-interest group focusing on public policy issues surrounding data
   935	networks. "Nobody should have an unfair advantage. This is important
   936	because we're talking about something that is in its infancy but that one
   937	day could be on the order of the personal computer industry."
