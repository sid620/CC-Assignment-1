     1	BOSTON - Accton Technology Corporation will Introduce the EtherCombo-32 and
     2	the EtherCombo-16 at this year's NetWorld Boston exhibition, two new
     3	network interface card adapters that incorporate the company's new EN50903
     4	proprietary Ethernet chip. These two network adapters represent the first
     5	In a new generation of networking products that consolidate multiple
     6	cabling and adapter standards into the same network inter ace card, giving
     7	network installers more integration flexibility with a single adapter.
     8	
     9	Unlike other network adapters, the EtherCombo cards have three types of
    10	connectors to accommodate any Ethernet cabling environment. A BNC
    11	connector is provided for thin Ethernet connections, an AUI connector for
    12	thick Ethernet, and an RJ-45 connector to accommodate unshielded
    13	twisted-pair cabling. The EtherCombo-32 (Model No. EN1200) is Accton's new
    14	802.3, 32-bit EISA bus network adapter card. Accton's new EISA bus adapter
    15	has a data bus width of 32 bits, and has built-in bus mastering, buffering
    16	up to 33 Mbytes of data for transfer for faster performance. A socket is
    17	also provided for an optional 16-Kbyte boot ROM chip.
    18	
    19	The EtherCombo-16 (Model No. EN1640) is Accton's newest 16-bit Ethernet
    20	card with BNC, AUI, and RJ45 cable support built in. Designed for the
    21	PC/XT/AT workstation bus, this adapter is fully compatible with Novell's
    22	NE1000 and NE2000 adapters, and with the Western Digital WD8003 Ethernet
    23	adapter. The EtherCombo-16's architecture provides support for l/O port
    24	and memory share data transfer. The adapter has an 8/16 data bus width,
    25	and there is a socket for an optional 16-, 32-, of 64-Kbyte boot ROM
    26	chip.
    27	
    28	As with all of Accton's network adapters, the EtherCombo-32 and the
    29	EtherCombo-16 come with their own diagnostic software package, AccTest,
    30	which verifies the integrity of any network connection. The adapters also
    31	come with drivers to support NetWare 2 x and 3.x, IBM's OS/2 Extended
    32	Edition, IBM's LAN Server, NetBlOS, Microsoft's LAN Manager, 3Com's
    33	3+Open, SCO UNIX, Interactive's UNIX, TCP/IP software from FTP and NCSA,
    34	PC-NFS from Sun, DECnet's Pathworks, Banyan's VINES, and Accton's own
    35	network operating system, LanSoft.
    36	
    37	"Our customers have been looking for a single network adapter that can meet
    38	all of their installation needs," explained Marshall Behiing, Marketing
    39	Director for Accton. "These two EtherCombo cards are the first step in
    40	consolidating various network standards into a single adapter. Now VARs
    41	can stock just two cards, one for AT-type workstations and one for
    42	EISA-type workstations and servers, and still support any cable type their
    43	customers might have installed. With these cards, it becomes easy to
    44	preconfigure workstations, making it a simple matter to provide
    45	plus-and-play connectivity to customers.
    46	
    47	"Furthermore, these new network adapters are the first Accton cards to
    48	utilize our new EN50903 Ethernet controller," Behling added. "Because we
    49	have developed our own high-performance chip, we can offer our customers
    50	both higher quality and greater Integration flexibility. By using our own
    51	chip technology we can not only assure our customers a steady supply of
    52	adapters, but we can back the quality of these NICs with a lifetime
    53	warranty. In fact, with these two adapters, Accton Is Introducing a
    54	two-for-one warranty on all of our board products - if an Accton adapter
    55	falls, the customer gets two replacement adapters free of charge."
    56	
    57	Accton's EN50903 controller combines the bus Inter ace and network
    58	interface controller Into a single Ethernet chip, making it possible to
    59	create network adapters that can support multiple connectivity platforms.
    60	The EN50903 can support both 8- and 16-bit bus topologies, as well as
    61	offering software-selectable support for AUI, BNC, and RJ-45 connectors.
    62	it also features a 16-Kbyte memory buffer, and has an EEPROM interface so
    63	network adapter Interface can be stored to configure the adapter
    64	automatically.
    65	
    66	Both EtherCombo network adapters are scheduled to ship in March.

    70	BOSTON - Accton Technology Corporation is introducing its new line of
    71	EtherCombo network interface cards at this year's NetWorld Boston. What
    72	makes these new NICs faster and more versatile is a new, proprietary,
    73	Ethernet controller chip, the EN50903, which makes it possible to support
    74	different PC bus speeds and bus interface, as well as delivering
    75	software-selectable cable support for thin Ethernet, thick Ethernet, and
    76	10BASE-T cabling.
    77	
    78	Accton's EN50903 integrates the bus interface controller and the network
    79	interface controller into a single chip. This makes it possible to create
    80	an Inexpensive, versatile network interface card that supports multiple
    81	cable types, as well as multiple PC bus configurations. The EN50903
    82	Interface control can handle an 8/16-bit l/O stream (which Is compatible
    83	with Novell's NE1000/NE2000), an 8 bit data stream with zero wait states
    84	and shared memory (which Is compatible with the Western Digital WD8003EB),
    85	and an 8-bit parallel port Interface for an external network adapter, such
    86	as Accton's EtherPocket which delivers the network connection through the
    87	parallel port.
    88	
    89	The EN50903 currently supports either an 8- or 16-bit data bus, has 16
    90	Kbytes of memory for data buffering, and has a software-selectable
    91	Interface for AUI, BNC, of RJ45 cable connectors. It also Implements 256
    92	I/O address selections with 64 shared memory address selections, 32 boot
    93	ROM address selections, and 8 interrupt channel selections. It also
    94	supports an EEPROM Interface to automatically store and configure the
    95	adapter, Including l/O address, memory address, BIOS ROM address,
    96	interrupt channel, memory buffer size, LAN address, and adapter type.
    97	
    98	"The EtherCombo cards are just the first of a new generation of Accton
    99	connectivity products that will give our customers greater networking
   100	flexibility with fewer network components," said Marshall Behling,
   101	Marketing Director for Accton. "From the customer's perspective, the
   102	obvious benefits of creating our own Ethernet controller chip are that we
   103	can deliver support for multiple cabling and hardware platforms in a
   104	single adapter. It also means we can deliver higher performance and
   105	greater reliability because we can control manufacturing from the silicon
   106	on up. That's why we can extend a lifetime warranty on all of our board
   107	products. From a manufacturers' viewpoint, it also means we can control
   108	our own destiny guaranteeing a steady supply of chips to meet the
   109	manufacturing demand."
   110	
   111	Accton executives have indicated that future Accton connectivity products
   112	will Incorporate the EN50903 controller chip.
