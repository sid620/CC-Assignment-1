     5	If you are reading this, you probably have a modem.
     6	
     7	Your modem may be equipped with MNP error correction/compression protocols
     8	(probably MNP 4 or 5 - will be explained soon).
     9	
    10	MNP can help you work faster. In addition to its error-free connection, it has
    11	features that increase the effective modem speed beyond its rated value.
    12	
    13	If you do have MNP, chances are you are NOT using it correctly - you probably
    14	do not communicate as fast as you can. In other words, you are probably paying
    15	Bezeq more than you should.
    16	
    17	Using MNP correctly requires that you set various options in various locations
    18	(your modem, your communication program and your file transfer protocols).
    19	You must set ALL options correctly to make MNP work. Moreover, your
    20	communicating partner (the BBS) must also set all ITS options correctly. The
    21	defaults that come with your modem and your software do not help - they are
    22	usually wrong.
    23	
    24	This article is intended to help you determine these settings so that you can
    25	utilize your modem to its best.
    26	
    27	The basic idea is very simple. First, you must get your modem to work in its
    28	highest speed (in other words, setup MNP correctly); then you must make sure
    29	that your computer and software do not become a bottleneck and slow the modem
    30	down. This simple idea is not very easy to implement, however, so read
    31	carefully.
    32	 
    33	One last remark. There are many brands of MNP modems in the market, and even
    34	more communication programs and file transfer protocols. I cannot cover all
    35	of them. The modem discussion will be based mainly on the Everex EV-941,
    36	which I own and know the best. The software part will discuss Telix, Telemate,
    37	Puma, Bimodem and DSZ. I will mention some other modems and software packages,
    38	but your favorite one may not be among them. READ ANYHOW: if you understand
    39	the basic ideas, you will probably be able to implement them for other
    40	hardware or software items.

    43	=================
    44	SOME MODEM BASICS
    45	=================
    46	
    47	So that we can all understand each other, let me draw some basic facts. They
    48	are not necessarily exact, but they are good enough for this discussion. If
    49	you are familiar with these facts, you can skip this and the following
    50	section.
    51	
    52	Let's assume that YOUR computer wants to send some data to MY computer. Here
    53	is what happens:
    54	
    55	Your computer sends the data to its own "Serial Adapter" (or "RS232 card").
    56	It sends the data in parallel - one full byte at a time (all bits together),
    57	along with some control information.
    58	
    59	Your serial adapter converts the data from parallel to serial representation.
    60	In other words, the bits that form the byte (which entered your adapter at the
    61	computer side together) leave it at the connector side one after the other.
    62	The adapter is asynchronous, which means that it adds a "Start" bit, "Stop"
    63	bit(s) and perhaps a parity bit to each sequence of bits that form a byte (I
    64	will not discuss this any further).
    65	
    66	Your Serial adapter narrows the eight-bits-per-byte-plus-control computer data
    67	to a fewer number of lines, but is still creates digital data, which can be
    68	transmitted over special (and short) lines only. This is why your adapter is
    69	connected to a modem. The modem translates the digital data to voices that can
    70	be transmitted over a standard telephone line.
    71	 
    72	On the other side of the phone line, my modem listens to the incoming voices,
    73	translates them to serial bits and feeds the bits into my serial adapter. This
    74	adapter converts the sequence of bits into parallel bytes, which are read by
    75	my computer.
    76	 
    77	To summarize:
    78	 
    79	-     Your computer creates parallel bytes;
    80	-     Your serial adapter receives parallel bytes and creates serial bits;
    81	-     Your modem receives serial bits and creates voices;
    82	-     My modem receives voices and creates serial bits;
    83	-     My serial adapter receives serial bits and creates parallel bytes;
    84	-     My computer receives parallel bytes.
    85	
    86	(By the way, "internal" modems - such as the Everex EV-941 - combine the
    87	serial adapter and the modem into a single card: they receive parallel data
    88	and send voices, and vice versa. This is transparent to the software, since
    89	the single-card modem emulates a serial adapter connected to an external
    90	modem, and there is no difference on either the computer or the telephone line
    91	side).
    92	
    93	
    94	=======================
    95	SOME MORE MODEM DETAILS
    96	=======================
    97	
    98	Let's get closer and examine some points in higher detail.
    99	
   100	Your serial adapter is "Full Duplex", and so is probably your modem. This
   101	means that they can receive and transmit data at the same time (the serial
   102	adapter actually has two physical lines - one for outgoing bits, one for
   103	incoming - as well as some control lines; the modem usually uses two basic
   104	frequencies, one for transmitting and one for receiving).
   105	
   106	Your software, serial adapter and modem must be able to tell when each of them
   107	is ready to communicate. In other words, there must be a standard method of
   108	"Handshaking" between all parties. This is done in several methods. 
   109	
   110	First, there are several control lines between the serial adapter and the
   111	modem (these lines can also be set and/or sensed by the software on the
   112	computer side of the serial adapter). Of these control lines I will mention
   113	four:
   114	
   115	-     DSR (Data Set Ready) - Modem-to-computer: Used by the modem to tell the
   116	      serial adapter and the computer that the modem is ready (but not
   117	      necessarily able to receive new data).
   118	
   119	-     CTS (Clear To Send) - Modem-to-computer: Used by the modem to tell the
   120	      serial adapter and the computer that the modem is able to receive new
   121	      data.
   122	
   123	-     DTR (Data Terminal Ready) - Computer-to-modem: Used by the serial
   124	      adapter to tell the modem that the adapter (and computer) is ready (but
   125	      not necessarily able to receive new data).
   126	
   127	-     RTS (Request To Send) - Computer-to-modem: Used by the serial adapter 
   128	      to tell the modem that the adapter (and computer) is able to receive new
   129	      data. 
   130	
   131	Not all four lines are used by all modems, but MNP modems usually use all
   132	four, as I'll explain later.
   133	
   134	There is an alternate way of handshaking between the communicating parties.
   135	Instead of relying on extra hardware lines, this method uses special ASCII
   136	values that are sent as standard data but have a unique meaning. These values
   137	are usually XON (hex 11), which means "start", and XOFF (hex 13), which means
   138	"stop". Using XON/XOFF has several disadvantages: it slows down the
   139	transmission (because handshaking comes in sequence rather than in parallel
   140	with the data), and more important - the XON/XOFF characters, being used for
   141	handshaking, are "swallowed" and cannot be transmitted as part of the normal
   142	data.
   143	
   144	One more thing you should know about modems is that they usually work in two
   145	modes. In normal mode, everything you send to the modem is transmitted over
   146	the phone to the other partner. The modem may also operate in "Command" mode;
   147	in this case, the data you send to the modem is interpreted as modem commands
   148	(the switch between normal and command mode will not be explained here, since
   149	it is usually done for you by your communication program). Most modems use the
   150	Hayes command language, in which all commands start with the characters "AT".
   151	The Hayes language is not uniform - every manufacturer has its own implement-
   152	ation of the language, particularly for such exotic things as MNP control,
   153	which is what this document is all about. I cannot therefore give exact rules
   154	that match all modems, and you will have to figure out your own commands if
   155	your modem is different than mine.
   156	
   157	
   158	====================
   159	COMMUNICATION SPEEDS
   160	====================
   161	
   162	I said "communication speeds" and not "communication speed" on purpose. Each
   163	modem has a rated maximum speed. This is somewhat misleading, because there
   164	are several speeds involved, and the final communication speed depends on
   165	more than one factor.
   166	
   167	The modem speed itself is measured in Bits Per Second, or BPS. This is the
   168	number of bits per second sent or received by the modem over the telephone
   169	line. The most common speed today is 2400 BPS (1200 is used by older or
   170	cheaper modems, while 9600 is becoming quite common).
   171	
   172	(You may also hear the term "modem Baud rate". IGNORE IT. This measures the
   173	number of modem status changes per second. 2400 BPS modems have usually a
   174	Baud rate of only 600, and use special techniques such as frequency shifting
   175	to squeeze in more bits per change in status).
   176	
   177	The modem speed (BPS) refers to the PHONE side of the modem. The speed on the
   178	other side, between the modem and the computer, is not necessarily the same.
   179	MNP modems are usually capable of talking to the computer faster than they
   180	talk between themselves; we'll soon see why this is necessary.
   181	
   182	When the modem-to-computer and modem-to-modem speeds are different, some
   183	handshaking techniques (explained above) must be used to ensure that the
   184	computer does not "overrun" the modem beyond its actual capabilities and vice
   185	versa.
   186	
   187	To complicate things a little more, the BPS speed measures the actual number
   188	of bits that flow between modems. MNP effective transfer rate can be faster,
   189	because less bits are needed to transmit the same amount of data.
   190	
   191	There is one thing you must remember. THE ACTUAL TRANSMISSION SPEED IS THE
   192	SPEED OF THE SLOWEST COMMUNICATING PARTNER. If your modem can talk 2400 and
   193	my can talk 1200, the actual speed will be 1200: this is straightforward. What
   194	is less obvious is that if your modem can talk to my modem at an effective
   195	speed of 3000 (actually 2400 enhanced by MNP) but your (or my) computer-to-
   196	modem speed is fixed at 2400, the final speed will only be 2400 - and neither
   197	of us may be aware of it.
   198	
   199	Communication is a two-partners game. You may set all your speeds correctly
   200	on your side, but this is not good enough. I must set my speeds right as well.
   201	SYSOPS PAY ATTENTION: There is a whole world out there waiting for you to
   202	setup your communication parameters correctly!
   203	
   204	
   205	===============
   206	SOME MNP BASICS
   207	===============
   208	
   209	MNP, or Microcom Networking Protocol (today supported by many more brands
   210	beside Microcom), was originally intended to ensure error-free communication
   211	between modems regardless of phone line conditions. MNP is divided into
   212	classes. In the first (and earliest) classes, the error-free communication was
   213	obtained at a price of reducing the effective speed (which is quite obvious
   214	if you think about it). Newer classes use special techniques that result in
   215	error-free data transfer while actually INCREASING the communication speed
   216	(moderately to considerably).
   217	
   218	MNP classes 1 and 2 reduce the transfer speed, and are not worth discussing.
   219	
   220	MNP class 3 is the first class that resulted in an increased transfer rate.
   221	This was done by communicating between the modems using SYNCHRONOUS "packets"
   222	without start and stop bits, although the data transfer on the other side of
   223	the modems (between the modems and the computer) is still synchronous. There
   224	is still some overhead involved, so the effective transfer rate of MNP 3 is
   225	about 108%, or up to 260 bytes per second for an 2400 BPS modem, compared to
   226	240 bytes for non-MNP (assuming 1 start bit, 1 stop bit and no parity). These
   227	speeds, by the way, are ideal and are never reached because of other limiting
   228	factors, but you can get quite close.
   229	
   230	MNP class 4 uses synchronous packets as well, and optimizes these packets by
   231	eliminating unnecessary data and adjusting to line conditions. The effective
   232	transfer rate of MNP 4 is up to 120%, or about 260 bytes per second for 2400
   233	(assuming there are not too many errors - remember that the communication is
   234	supposed to be error-free as well as faster).
   235	
   236	MNP class 5 adds data compression to MNP 4. A real-time adaptive compression
   237	algorithm is used, which means that the modem adjust the algorithm all the
   238	time to match the data being transferred. Unlike the previous classes, which
   239	provide a constant speed factor, compression depends of course on the data
   240	being transmitted. MNP 5 is considered to have an effective rate of 200%,
   241	which makes a 2400 BPS modem behave like a 4800. 
   242	
   243	There is a catch, however. If your modem does mainly file transfers from a
   244	BBS, chances are that you will not gain much by compression (to put it in
   245	other words, if the already-compressed .ZIP or .ICE etc. files in the BBS can
   246	be squeezed any further, the file compression method should probably be
   247	changed!). Some publication suggest that you would be better off WITHOUT data
   248	compression in this case, since compression does have its price, which means
   249	that you should revoke MNP 5 and go back to using MNP 4. My own experience is
   250	that MNP 5 does not harm file transfers that much, and you should probably
   251	keep it on to take care of interactive BBS work, but your case might be
   252	different - feel free to experiment and let me know the results.
   253	
   254	This is as far as I will go. There are several further MNP classes (the latest
   255	one I heard of is MNP 10, which makes a 2400 BPS modem behave like 19200!),
   256	but the idea is the same, and modems above MNP 5 are still not that common.
   257	
   258	One thing I didn't say, but should be obvious, is that MNP is a two-way
   259	business - both communicating modems must use the same MNP level when they
   260	communicate (the modems may negotiate and agree upon a certain level when they
   261	make the first connection).
   262	
   263	
   264	====================================
   265	HOW TO SPEED THINGS UP - BASIC IDEAS
   266	====================================
   267	
   268	Enough with the theory - let's start doing something useful.
   269	
   270	The things you should do to make your communication faster can be summarized
   271	as follows:
   272	
   273	1.    PURCHASE AN MNP MODEM (at least MNP 4, probably 5).
   274	
   275	2.    PURCHASE A FAST-ENOUGH COMMUNICATION PROGRAM, that will not cause a
   276	      bottleneck on your computer (notice that I said "purchase", not "steal"
   277	      or "borrow"!).
   278	
   279	3.    MAKE YOUR MODEM USE MNP (4 or 5 - as I said, I don't have a good advise
   280	      here). This is rather easy, but remember that most MNP modems do NOT use
   281	      MNP as a default, so you have to do some manual work.
   282	
   283	4.    MAKE YOUR SERIAL ADAPTER TALK TO THE MODEM AT A HIGHER RATE THAN THE
   284	      MODEM'S NOMINAL RATE. The manuals suggest 4800 for a 2400 modem; I
   285	      myself am more optimistic and use 9600.
   286	
   287	5.    MAKE SURE YOUR MODEM STAYS AT THE HIGH MODEM-TO-ADAPTER SPEED and does
   288	      not revert to the modem-to-modem nominal speed when the connection is
   289	      made.
   290	
   291	6.    MAKE SURE YOUR COMMUNICATION PROGRAM STAYS AT THE HIGH SPEED and does
   292	      not revert to the modem nominal speed when the connection is made.
   293	
   294	7.    USE HARDWARE-LEVEL HANDSHAKING (CTS/RTS) between the modem and your
   295	      communication program. Do NOT use XON/XOFF handshaking.
   296	
   297	This is all you have to do, but you must make sure you do EVERYTHING specified
   298	here. If you do a partial job, you'll end up without any gain in speed (the
   299	better case) or with unreadable garbage on your screen (the worse case).
   300	
   301	
   302	============================================
   303	HOW TO SPEED THINGS UP - A PRACTICAL EXAMPLE
   304	============================================
   305	
   306	For the hardware part, let me assume that you have purchased an Everex EV941
   307	modem with MNP 5 (this is NOT a recommendation - there may be better bargains
   308	in the market). I'll also discuss some other modem setup possibilities.
   309	
   310	For the software part, you may use the communication program that comes
   311	bundled with your modem (Everex comes with something called "BitCom"), but
   312	there ARE much better bargains in the market, and some of them are shareware,
   313	so you can experiment and purchase the one you like. I'll mention two:
   314	
   315	-     Telix seems like a fairly good choice. It is FAST, not too large, has
   316	      built-in ZMODEM and a powerful script language, and is not too annoying
   317	      to use.
   318	
   319	-     Telemate is considered to be a good choice, since it allows a kind of
   320	      multitasking (you can browse a file while you download so you can decide
   321	      on-the-fly what to download next). If your computer is slow, Telemate
   322	      may not be fast enough and may become a bottleneck (something a
   323	      communication software should never be), and it also eats up too much
   324	      of your precious RAM, but it is still worth considering.
   325	
   326	I have also experimented with some other packages (including Procomm, Procomm
   327	Plus which is used at my work but is NOT shareware, Boyan, Qmodem and GT1500).
   328	Most of them can be used quite easily with MNP.
   329	
   330	A communication program is not complete without some external file transfer
   331	protocols. There are about a dozen of them around, but I'll discuss only
   332	three: Puma, which is fast and elegant; Bimodem, which is quite amazing (it
   333	is truly full-duplex - allows you to upload and download simultaneously at
   334	full speed, and even chat with your friend at the same time); and DSZ, which
   335	contains several protocols including ZMODEM and is preferred by many users.
   336	
   337	
   338	===========
   339	MODEM SETUP
   340	===========
   341	
   342	In the following lines I'll discuss only those modem settings that are
   343	important for proper MNP operation. There are more options that I will not
   344	mention.
   345	
   346	Commands that have an alphabetic character immediately following the AT code
   347	are usually common among all modems. Commands that start with AT& are less
   348	common, and there are some variations. Commands that start with AT\, AT% or
   349	AT* are unique, and probably have other codes in other modems.
   350	
   351	ATB1        (Mandatory, default). Selects the Bell 212A protocol.
   352	
   353	ATE1        (Mandatory, default). Echoes the commands to the screen; some
   354	            communication programs require it, for others it does no harm.
   355	
   356	ATQ0        (Mandatory, default). Suppresses "quiet" modes, and causes command
   357	            responses to be sent by the modem (most communication programs
   358	            require it to tell when a communication has been made, etc.).
   359	
   360	ATV1        (Recommended, default). Causes command responses to be displayed
   361	            in English words rather than in numeric codes.
   362	
   363	ATX4        (Recommended, default). Causes the modem to wait for dial tone
   364	            before dialing, and to detect BUSY and NO ANSWER conditions. some
   365	            modems may not support it.
   366	
   367	AT&C1       (Mandatory, default). Causes the modem to indicate Data Carrier
   368	            Detect (DCD) only when there is actually a modem on the other
   369	            side (DCD is not explained in this article).
   370	
   371	AT&D2       (Mandatory, default). Causes the modem to hang up when the DTR
   372	            line is down (DTR is explained above).
   373	
   374	AT&S1       (Mandatory, NOT default!). Causes the modem to keep the DSR line
   375	            up only when the modem is active (DSR is explained above). BE
   376	            CAREFUL: Other modems use AT&S for other things (Motorola 82240,
   377	            for example, uses it for front switch settings control).
   378	
   379	AT\C1       (Mandatory, NOT default!). Enables an internal modem buffer to be
   380	            used while the modems negotiate MNP. If not used, the first
   381	            characters in the transmission may be lost.
   382	
   383	AT\G0       (Mandatory, default). Disables XON/XOFF flow control between the
   384	            two modems. Setting AT\G1 will cause problems with some file
   385	            transfer protocols (such as Bimodem).
   386	
   387	AT\J0       (Mandatory, NOT default, VERY important!). Turns "baud adjust"
   388	            off. The default (AT\J1) causes your modem to adjust the speed by
   389	            which it communicates with your computer (the RS232 side) to the
   390	            nominal modem-to-modem speed at connect time, which eliminates all
   391	            MNP speed gains (your 2400 modem will talk "effective-4800" to the
   392	            second modem, but only 2400 to your computer!). Setting AT\J0
   393	            keeps the speed between the modem and the serial port constant
   394	            (how to set this speed initially is explained below). Other modems
   395	            use other commands for this, such as AT&I1.
   396	
   397	AT\K5       (Mandatory, default). Causes a Break signal to be sent and
   398	            received in sequence with the data, which is important for file
   399	            transfers. Other modems use other commands for this, such as
   400	            AT*Y2.
   401	
   402	AT\N3       (Mandatory, NOT default!). Causes the modem to work in "auto-
   403	            reliable" mode, which means that it will try to use MNP and fall
   404	            back to non-MNP if the other modem is not compatible. The default
   405	            (AT\N1) DISABLES MNP altogether. Other modems use other commands
   406	            for this, such as AT&E4 or AT&E6.
   407	
   408	AT\Q3       (Mandatory, NOT default, VERY important!). Causes hardware-level
   409	            handshaking (RTS/CTS) between your modem and your computer. If the
   410	            modem and the serial adapter speeds are different (such as when
   411	            AT\J0 is specified), handshaking MUST be enabled. DO NOT use
   412	            XON/XOFF handshaking (AT\Q1), because it will cause problems with
   413	            some file transfer protocols. Other modems use other commands for
   414	            this, such as AT&K2.
   415	
   416	AT\V1       (Recommended, NOT default!). Causes the modem replies to indicate
   417	            if a reliable (MNP) connection has been made - you should probably
   418	            want to know what kind of connection you have established.
   419	
   420	AT\X1       (Mandatory, NOT default!). Enables XON/XOFF characters to be sent
   421	            to the other modem as data. The default (AT\X0) will swallow
   422	            XON/XOFF and will cause problems with some file transfer
   423	            protocols.
   424	
   425	AT%C1       (Up to you - I use it; NOT default). Enables data compression
   426	            (uses MNP 5 rather than MNP 4). If you can prove that MNP 5 slows
   427	            down file transfers considerably, I'll be glad (?) to switch back
   428	            to AT%C0.
   429	
   430	ATDT        (Recommended). This has nothing to do with MNP, but you may be
   431	            able to use touch-tone (DTMF) dialing without being aware of it,
   432	            and it is a real time saver. Even if you can't, try to ask Bezeq -
   433	            you may be surprised.
   434	
   435	AT&W0       You probably do not want to type all those setup strings every
   436	            time, so save them once with AT&W0, and indicate to your
   437	            communication program that your modem initialization string is
   438	            simply ...
   439	
   440	ATZ         Which is easy to remember and use.
   441	
   442	AT&V        (View setting). Use this to check your non-MNP modem settings.
   443	
   444	ATI6        (Inquire modem). Use this to check your special MNP modem settings
   445	            (why use two different codes is beyond me).
   446	
   447	
   448	===========
   449	TELIX SETUP
   450	===========
   451	
   452	If you are using Telix as your favorite communication program, there are
   453	several things that you should do to make it work properly with MNP.
   454	
   455	First, bring up the Telix setup menu (Alt-O), and select "Terminal options".
   456	
   457	Within "Terminal options", select option A and set the default baud rate to
   458	9600 (!) if your modem is 2400 MNP. This will ensure that the serial-adapter-
   459	to-modem speed is high enough not to cause a bottleneck.
   460	
   461	Then select the appropriate options to turn XON/XOFF flow control OFF, CTS/RTS
   462	flow control ON, and DSR/DTR flow control OFF. Do not use any other
   463	combination of flow control!
   464	
   465	Now go back to the configuration menu and select "Modem and dialing". Set the
   466	modem initialization string to ATZ^M (provided that you have saved your
   467	setup!), and set Auto Baud detect to OFF.
   468	
   469	Finally, go to your dialing directory and define ALL entries to have a speed
   470	of 9600 (even if you know for sure they are only 1200 or 2400).
   471	
   472	Now start working. You should notice that the speed indication in the status
   473	line always says 9600, whether you are idle or communicating. If it is (and
   474	if you manage to work), you probably did everything right.
   475	
   476	(What happens is that Telix talks to your modem at a constant speed of 9600
   477	BPS and uses CTS/RTS flow control to avoid overruns; your modem talks to the
   478	other modem as fast as it can, taking advantage of MNP if available, and is
   479	not delayed by your computer's hardware or software).
   480	
   481	There is one small problem. If you upload or download with Telix's internal
   482	protocols, the estimated transfer time will be incorrect, because it will be
   483	based on the assumption that your modem is actually 9600 BPS. This is a small
   484	price to pay in order to be able to work faster.
   485	
   486	
   487	==============
   488	TELEMATE SETUP
   489	==============
   490	
   491	First of all, use Telemate only if your computer is fast enough and has enough
   492	free memory - writing programs in C using Vermont Views results in very good
   493	programs but does not contribute to their size and performance.
   494	
   495	Go to Telemate's options menu (use your mouse or Alt-O).
   496	
   497	Select "Dial setup", and turn "Auto Baud detect" OFF.
   498	
   499	Select "Terminal", and turn XON/XOFF flow control OFF and RTS/CTS flow control
   500	ON.
   501	
   502	Select "Communication", and set the modem initialization string to ATZ^M
   503	(provided that you have saved your setup!). In addition, set the "Baud rate"
   504	(which by now you know should say BPS, not Baud) to 9600 (!) if your modem is
   505	2400 MNP. This will ensure that the serial-adapter-to-modem speed is high
   506	enough not to cause a bottleneck.
   507	
   508	Do not forget to save your setup.
   509	
   510	Finally, switch to your dialing directory and define ALL entries to have a
   511	speed of 9600 (even if you know for sure they are only 1200 or 2400).
   512	
   513	Now start working. If you left your status line on, you should notice that the
   514	speed indication in the status line always indicates 9600, whether you are
   515	idle or communicating. If it is (and if you manage to work), you probably did
   516	everything right.
   517	
   518	Unlike Telix, Telemate adjusts its estimated upload/download times as it
   519	works. Therefore, only the initial estimated transfer time will be incorrect
   520	(because it will be based on the assumption that your modem is actually 9600
   521	BPS), but after a few blocks the estimate will be corrected.
   522	
   523	
   524	==========
   525	PUMA SETUP
   526	==========
   527	
   528	If you are using Puma as an external protocol, you can have MNP speed AND a
   529	correct estimate of the file transfer time.
   530	
   531	Run PUMASET to configure Puma, and choose "Change default options". In this
   532	menu, select the following:
   533	
   534	-     UART Baud - "current" (assuming you always call Puma when your
   535	      communication program is operating).
   536	
   537	-     Effective Baud - 2400 (assuming your modem is 2400). This figure is used
   538	      for estimating the file transfer time.
   539	
   540	-     CTS/RTS handshake - "fast".
   541	
   542	
   543	=============
   544	BIMODEM SETUP
   545	=============
   546	
   547	Bimodem is a protocol you cannot live without if you plan on being a honest
   548	person and upload at least once in a while.
   549	
   550	Like Puma, Bimodem can be configured to use MNP and estimate times correctly.
   551	
   552	To do this, run BICONFIG (either directly or from BIMENU). Select "Terminal
   553	options" and set the following:
   554	
   555	-     "Baud (yack!) rate to base estimate on" - type here your nominal modem
   556	      speed (e.g. 2400). This figure is used for estimating the file transfer
   557	      time. Note that if you use MNP, your effective BPS rate will be faster,
   558	      and the estimated time will be too long.
   559	
   560	-     "CTS/RTS hardware flow control" - set to "Y".
   561	
   562	The next time you are asked why you always download and never upload, do not
   563	use the "I don't have time" or "I don't have money" excuses - they do not work
   564	well with Bimodem.
   565	
   566	
   567	=========
   568	DSZ SETUP
   569	=========
   570	
   571	DSZ is a famous yet not-very-user-friendly file transfer package that supports
   572	several protocols, most importantly ZMODEM. It is a must if you use a
   573	communication program that does not have internal ZMODEM, and there are those
   574	out there who use it even with Telix or Telemate, because DSZ is supposed to
   575	be faster and better (you can try it and judge for yourself).
   576	
   577	The following comments are based on the DSZ version dated April 11, 1990
   578	(known as DSZ0411). They are probably relevant to other versions as well.
   579	
   580	DSZ is command-line oriented and does not have a separate setup mode. The DSZ
   581	documentation has the courtesy of stating that it has a "handshake XX"
   582	command-line option (which can be abbreviated to "ha"), but it does not
   583	indicate what values this mysterious XX can take (this is part of the
   584	package's user-friendliness). If you dig deep enough, you find that the value
   585	relevant to MNP is "handshake cts". The DSZ command for ZMODEM downloading
   586	should therefore look something like:
   587	
   588	      DSZ ha cts rz -rr <other options>
   589	
   590	note that there is no hyphen before "ha", and that you must use lowercase
   591	characters.
   592	
   593	DSX has another option that may be relevant, called "estimate". If you
   594	indicate the effective BPS rate to DSZ (such as 2400 when using non-MNP or
   595	2900 when using MNP), DSZ will show a correct estimated transfer time;
   596	otherwise the estimate will be based on the RS232 speed (9600) and will be
   597	incorrect. If your file transfer is long enough, you may have enough time to
   598	locate where exactly on the screen DSZ gives its estimate - somewhere towards
   599	the end of its numerous line-mode messages.

   603	A FINAL WORD FOR SYSOPS
   604	=======================
   605	
   606	As you have probably guessed by now, I am NOT a SYSOP and probably never will
   607	be (I am too old, too busy and too poor).
   608	
   609	I therefore have no idea what to do on your side of the game to make MNP work.
   610	
   611	We users can do everything we can, but if you do not setup your end correctly,
   612	we will never gain speed.
   613	
   614	If any of you out there knows what to do with all those Front Doors and Remote
   615	Accesses an QBBSes and FileDoors and other Buzzwords to make them utilize MNP,
   616	please share this information with other SYSOPs, so that you and us (who cares
   617	about you and us? - me!) can save some time and money.
   618	
   619	
   620	========================
   621	A FINAL WORD TO EVERYONE
   622	========================
   623	
   624	I don't want to have too many mistakes in this document. If you find one, or
   625	if you want to add your own comments, please let me know.
   626	
   627	You spent some money on your equipment - I hope this will help you use it
   628	cheeper and faster.
