     7	        Personal Computers were first available on the mass market in 
     8	        1977.  At that time there were basically three brands widely 
     9	        available, Apple, Tandy, and Commodore.  I bought a TRS-80 model 
    10	        I in the fall of that year and began computer consulting the 
    11	        next spring.  Things have changed a lot in the last 14 years.  
    12	        These are a few observations on some of the developments and 
    13	        trends.
    14	
    15	        In the early 1980s a man would come to me and say, "I have a 
    16	        problem in my business.  It concerns efficiency in office 
    17	        procedures.  I am covered up in writing, bookkeeping, billing, 
    18	        paying, keeping track of customers, etc.  They said you have 
    19	        been able to show other businesses how to use computers to solve 
    20	        these problems.  Please show me."
    21	
    22	        I would then analyse his business talking not only to him but 
    23	        primarily to his secretary and/or bookkeeper(s) to find just how 
    24	        his business ran, what the problems were, and what was unique 
    25	        about his business (something almost always was).  I would plan 
    26	        hardware and develop software designed to work efficiently to 
    27	        solve his problems and to grow with his business for the next 
    28	        five or (wistfully) ten years.  I would install the system, 
    29	        train his employees and support the system with further 
    30	        modifications, hardware and software maintenance, additional 
    31	        training, etc. as needed.  This worked well and was always 
    32	        successful. 
    33	
    34	        Now a man comes to me and says, "I have a problem in my 
    35	        business.  I heard computerizing would solve my problem, so I 
    36	        read the computer magazines, talked to the computer literacy 
    37	        instructor at the high school, talked to a number of computer 
    38	        salesmen, and asked a computer whiz I know who has three 
    39	        computers and unbelievable games on them (He has the highest 
    40	        score in town on "Shoot The Martians").  All these people told 
    41	        me that my problems would be solved if I got a 386 with 4 meg 
    42	        RAM, 40 meg. hard drive, VGA, laser printer, Windows, Lotus 123, 
    43	        Dbase and Wordperfect."
    44	
    45	        "I bought all these, spent months reading the manuals and 
    46	        installing it all, and got the computer whiz to come by when 
    47	        school was out and show my employees how to use it all.   And, 
    48	        you know, I still have the problem in my business.  As a matter 
    49	        of fact my employees spend so much time using and learning the 
    50	        new computer system that I've had to hire an additional employee 
    51	        to make sure we get the billing out each month.  Now, they say 
    52	        you have solved business problems for others with computers, so 
    53	        I am willing to pay you to show me how to use this stuff to 
    54	        solve my problems."
    55	
    56	        I explain to this man that I was able to solve other's problems 
    57	        by an analysis of their business and by developing or installing 
    58	        software specifically for that purpose, that this will not use 
    59	        all the memory, Windows, 123, and Dbase that he has already 
    60	        installed, that I use cheaper hardware and charge more for 
    61	        systems analysis and custom programming and that therefore 
    62	        solving his problems will require an additional investment of 
    63	        $2,000 or more and that probably $2,000 of his original 
    64	        investment will be useless to him.  He usually concludes at this 
    65	        point that I must not know much about computers.  He ends up 
    66	        using parts of whatever of his software he can and decides that 
    67	        computers can't really do as much as he had been led to believe 
    68	        after all. 
    69	         
    70	        This problem arises primarily because of the way the computer 
    71	        industry has marketed computers and software in the last 14 
    72	        years.  In the first stage the industry said, "Buy a computer!"  
    73	        John Q. Public said, "Why?" and the industry said, "Because they 
    74	        can do anything you tell them."  The problem was JQP didn't know 
    75	        what he wanted them to do and he didn't know how to tell them to 
    76	        do it anyway.  So a couple of real smart guys wrote Visicalc, 
    77	        the first spreadsheet program for microcomputers.  JQP found 
    78	        that for some things that he was already doing on paper 
    79	        spreadsheets, a computer with VC was much more efficient. If he 
    80	        knew how to design a spreadsheet on paper, he could do the same 
    81	        thing on the computer and increase productivity immensely.  He 
    82	        was programming a computer but he didn't know that.  
    83	
    84	        The industry marketing men saw what had happened and changed 
    85	        their tactic.  They now said, "Buy a computer so you can run 
    86	        VC."  And a number of accountants and other number crunchers did 
    87	        just that.  As a matter of fact some of the more savvy salesmen 
    88	        began giving away pirated copies of VC with each computer sale.  
    89	        Their profit was on hardware, not software.  Many salesmen who 
    90	        had never used a paper spreadsheet much less VC told people that 
    91	        to do anything now they just needed a computer and VC.  When 
    92	        asked what type of thing they might do the computer salesman 
    93	        replied that JQP could now balance his checkbook with a 
    94	        computer.  Never mind that if JQP didn't know how to balance a 
    95	        checkbook the computer wasn't going to help and if he did he 
    96	        certainly didn't need a computer for that.
    97	
    98	        The next development of interest was the discovery that if one 
    99	        knew how to type he could increase productivity immensely with a 
   100	        word processing program.  This then developed much the same way
   101	        as the VC phenomena.   
   102	
   103	        From the beginning the computer marketers and the media had 
   104	        envisioned a computer in every household.  Problem was that, so 
   105	        far, computers were selling primarily to accountants and 
   106	        typists.  Apple computer decided that the thing standing in the 
   107	        way of more computer sales was the fact that not enough people 
   108	        knew how to use a spreadsheet or to type.  Hence the GUI 
   109	        (Graphical Computer Interface) and the mouse.  Theoretically, we 
   110	        could throw away the keyboard now and everyone could own a 
   111	        computer.  Of course, since this didn't teach one to do 
   112	        accounting or use a spreadsheet and since you couldn't write a 
   113	        document with a mouse there was no reason to buy a computer, but 
   114	        Apple overlooked that.  As a matter of fact, after the 
   115	        introduction of the Macintosh, Apple probably would have gone 
   116	        out of business if not for one further development. 
   117	
   118	        Someone, (I don't know who but somebody does) came up with the 
   119	        idea of using the Macintosh for Desktop Publishing, a quantum 
   120	        extension of word processing which was ideally suited to a GUI 
   121	        and a mouse.  (Course, it also required a keyboard but that was 
   122	        OK.)  This sold so many Macs that Microsoft and IBM took notice 
   123	        and decided that a GUI must be the way to go.
   124	
   125	        Others decided that part of the problem with computer sales was 
   126	        that computers require programs and JQP could not or was afraid 
   127	        to program.  So they wrote applications that would help JQP to 
   128	        write his own programs but would not let him know that he was 
   129	        doing so.  These took the form of Dbase type programs and a 
   130	        tremendous increase in the size and complexity of VC which by 
   131	        now was owned by Lotus and was called 123.  The thing they 
   132	        didn't tell JQP was that by trying to force a computer to do 
   133	        something with such a general purpose tool as Dbase or 123, he 
   134	        was sacrificing efficiency and that if the application became 
   135	        very complex it could be programmed and would work much more 
   136	        efficiently and easily in a true programming language like 
   137	        pascal, or C, or compiled basic or whatever.  They also didn't 
   138	        tell JQP that a complex application would be just as hard to 
   139	        program in Dbase or 123 as in a true language even though it 
   140	        would not work nearly as well. I knew a hospital controller who 
   141	        tried to run a hospital billing and accounting system with 123.  
   142	        You can drill a hole with a hammer and nails too, but a drill is 
   143	        so much more efficient. 
   144	
   145	        From the very beginning the problem was that computers could 
   146	        perform miracles in efficiency but only the systems analysts and 
   147	        the programmers knew how.  The marketing planners and the 
   148	        salesmen didn't, so they misled JQP.  Those who most need 
   149	        computers, mostly businessmen, are not analysts or programmers 
   150	        and should not be.  There were never enough programmers and 
   151	        analysts to sell the number of computers the industry wanted to 
   152	        sell.  Therefore, efficiency was sacrificed by use of general 
   153	        purpose programs.  Although these usually did not do the job 
   154	        well (sometimes not at all), they were cheaper than efficient 
   155	        programs and they were available.  The hoax was that JQP was 
   156	        never told that use of these programs required a sacrifice of 
   157	        efficiency but was simply led to believe that the inadequacies 
   158	        of these programs was intrinsic to computers. 
   159	
   160	        Another hoax occurred as the price of computer hardware and 
   161	        software fell.  It is necessary to charge $3,000 to $5,000 for a 
   162	        computer system to justify enough profit to support the 
   163	        industry.  At first, the price could be maintained by simply 
   164	        selling more powerful and faster hardware and software to JQP 
   165	        for the same price that he was used to paying.  After a while 
   166	        though, it became evident that the hardware and software was 
   167	        already as fast as JQP could ever want to perform most 
   168	        applications.  The solution was to change the operating system 
   169	        to OS2 and to GUIs such as Windows that were inefficient in 
   170	        speed and in use of memory.  By convincing the public that these 
   171	        were necessary it became possible to sell even faster machines 
   172	        with increased memory, etc.
   173	
   174	        These are my nominations for most significant developments in 
   175	        microcomputers over the last 14 years with my designation of
