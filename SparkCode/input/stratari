    18	      Hello  again friends  and neighbors.    I just  had  a wierd  thought
    19	 (another  weird thought, actually).   Wouldn't it really  freak you out to
    20	 find  out that  I  was not  a  real person,  but an  interactive  computer
    21	 program  that could scan the  libraries here on  CompuServe and winnow out
    22	 the good  stuff for  you?   Well, it  might not  freak _you_  out, but  it
    23	 _would_ freak my fiancee out (although I think  she believes that I've had
    24	 some sort of electronic implants already anyway).
    25	
    26	      Well,  at any rate, Thanksgiving is this coming week and Christmas is
    27	 only a  month after that.   It looks like there  will be a  good supply of
    28	 Jaguars (at  least in New  York and San  Francisco) for the  holidays.  If
    29	 someone had told me last year that Atari  would have product available for
    30	 Christmas I would have told them that they were nuts.
    31	
    32	      Okay, enough  of this.   Let's get on with  the reason we're  here in
    33	 the first  place... the  great information  available every  week here  on
    34	 Compuserve.
    35	
    36	
    37	 From the Atari Productivity Forum
    38	 =================================
    39	
    40	
    41	 Myles Cohen, one of the regulars here on CompuServe, asks:
    42	
    43	 "Does anyone know how to diagnose and fix a cartridge port... It used
    44	 to work until I did something that involved my scanner... which caused
    45	 it to not work any more...
    46	
    47	 Now everything on the MEGASTE works normally...except the
    48	 fershlugginer cartridge port...
    49	
    50	 I've already asked this...but never got an answer...And no...I can't
    51	 take it to a repair shop...because I use it every day...and it works
    52	 beautifully except for the two progs that use the port...one of which
    53	 is Notator...even if I knew of a repair shop in my area...which I
    54	 don't..."
    55	
    56	 Sysop Bob Retelle tells Myles:
    57	
    58	 "What happened with the scanner when the cartridge port stopped
    59	 working..?
    60	
    61	 I'm not sure if the cartridge lines are buffered electrically or
    62	 not.. that would be a good place to start.
    63	
    64	 There's also the possibility that the actual cartridge connector has
    65	 been loosened from the motherboard traces.  It might be a good idea to
    66	 try resoldering the connections with a low-powered soldering pencil."
    67	
    68	 Myles fills Bob in:
    69	
    70	 "I don't know...but the scanner was the last thing I had plugged into
    71	 the port when it stopped working...
    72	
    73	 Not being a hardware person...I have no idea what that last sentence
    74	 means...nor how to go  about it..."
    75	
    76	 Bob counts off a couple of possibilities for Myles:
    77	
    78	 "If you remember the problems Brad has had with his ST, the trouble in
    79	 both cases turned out to be an IC chip that goes between the
    80	 sensitive internal cirtuitry of the computer and the "outside
    81	 world"...
    82	
    83	 The chip effectively "buffers" the computer from the static
    84	 electricity, random voltage spikes on the telephone line, and all
    85	 kinds of unfriendly influences like that.
    86	
    87	 In many cases, these "buffer chips" will give their "lives" to
    88	 protect the rest of the system from these things.  Replacing them is
    89	 generally a pretty easy operation, and the chips themselves are fairly
    90	 common and inexpensive.
    91	
    92	 It's almost like replacing a blown fuse.
    93	
    94	 Now the ones Brad had trouble with were on the MIDI port and the
    95	 RS-232 serial port..  I'm not sure if the cartridge port has similar
    96	 "buffers" or not... it would be good electrical design to have them,
    97	 but they do add to the cost of the computer.  (I'll see if I can trace
    98	 the lines on my 520 and try to tell if there's anything I can identify
    99	 as buffering on the cartridge port).
   100	
   101	 That's an electronic possibility... the other thing I mentioned is a
   102	 "mechanical" possibility.
   103	
   104	 In inserting and removing cartridges and other devices, there's a lot
   105	 of physical force applied to the joints where the actual cartridge
   106	 socket is soldered onto the computer's motherboard.  Over time, that
   107	 force can break the tiny solder bonds that make the electrical
   108	 connections.  Sometimes it will result in erratic operation as the
   109	 board flexes and causes the connections to open and close, and other
   110	 times it can just render the connector completely inoperative...
   111	 (this is a common problem with most motherboard mounted connectors
   112	 like joystick connectors and keyboard sockets).
   113	
   114	 As long as there isn't any serious damage to the motherboard itself,
   115	 the fix is to carefully re-solder the connections.
   116	
   117	 Either solution (assuming that's the problem) will require some
   118	 electronics expertise..  the buffer chips on the ST are all soldered
   119	 to the motherboard, so replacing one is not just a matter of unpluging
   120	 it from a socket.
   121	
   122	 If you know anyone who's done electronics repair, it would be fairly
   123	 simple for them to do for you... nothing is Atari specific, or
   124	 requiring any special info.  Any electronics repair shop could do the
   125	 re-soldering or chip replacement if it turns out that's the solution."
   126	
   127	 Myles gives us some more information about his predicament:
   128	
   129	 "There are new developments...
   130	
   131	 I've been on the phone with a distant...from me...electronix guru who
   132	 listened to my tale of woe and suggested that I should use a
   133	 multi-tester on the outside pins...first and last...of the cartridge
   134	 port on the MEGASTE to see if there was conductivity...my reading
   135	 showed zero...
   136	
   137	 He then told me that the MegaSTE's cartridge port is protected a 1/2
   138	 Amp microfuse narked F-121 and which can easily be found on the
   139	 motherboard very close to the port...that all I had to do was to test
   140	 it for conductivity...which if I got a zero reading needs to be
   141	 replaced...I got a zero reading...
   142	
   143	 Now all I have to do is find a 1/2 Amp microfuse to replace it...I
   144	 guess that Best Electonics is my best bet...
   145	
   146	 What a great diagnostician you turned out to be...Just look at the
   147	 line on the top of this message that I quote from your pevious note..."
   148	
   149	 Well Myles, good luck with your cartridge port problem... at one time or
   150	 another, every computer owner has to deal with problems like this.
   151	 Luckily, there are people like Bob Retelle to help the rest of us out.
   152	
   153	 Meanwhile, Elaine Eedson asks about a program to make using CompuServe
   154	 even easier:
   155	
   156	 "Could anyone give me any information about navigation programs for
   157	 Atari ST that are comparable to CIM.  I'm  looking for one that can be
   158	 used and act like CIM."
   159	
   160	 Jim Ness tells Elaine:
   161	
   162	 "There are no CIM equivalents for the ST.  CIM is a CompuServe
   163	 product, and CompuServe has only made PC and Mac versions available.
   164	
   165	 There also is no other similar program, in terms of navigating by
   166	 Point-and-Click methods.
   167	
   168	 There is QuickCIS, a true navigator program.  QuickCIS quickly
   169	 gathers all mail and messages for you, and then logs off.  You read it
   170	 all offline, and your replies can be posted on your next call.
   171	 QuickCIS can be found in Library 4 here."
   172	
   173	 Stefan Daystrom of Barefoot Software tells Elaine:
   174	
   175	 "CIM itself is only available in IBM/compatible and Mac versions.  If
   176	 you _really_ need something _just like_ CIM, the only way on the Atari
   177	 would be to run an IBM or Mac emulator (typically involving adding
   178	 hardware).
   179	
   180	 However, if you're paying for the use of your account, why spend time
   181	 online "live", with _whatever_ user interface, when you can use an
   182	 _automated_ navigator that'll log on, capture all the messages you're
   183	 interested in, log off, let you read them and reply to them at any
   184	 speed you want ("off the clock"), and then log on again for just a
   185	 minute or two to upload all your replies?  _That_ you can get for the
   186	 Atari with QuickCis.  (Also get QCMsg_II, an improved message reader
   187	 that works with QuickCis.  You _can_ you QuickCis by itself, but
   188	 you'll have a lot more flexibility in reading and replying to messages
   189	 if you use QCMsg_II with it.)
   190	
   191	 An automated navigator such as QuickCis will cut your connect time
   192	 with CompuServe _way_ down.  If you have enough (offline!) time, you
   193	 can then use that to expand to reading other areas of CompuServe that
   194	 you might not have been able to afford if always using it "live".
   195	 It'll also cut down the amount of time your phone line at home is tied
   196	 up with modem calls..."
   197	
   198	 Take it from me Elaine, QuickCis is the way to go!
   199	
   200	 Now for "something completely different" from Rob Rasmussen:
   201	
   202	 "My ST knows exactly what month/day/year and time it is even though I
   203	 no longer have my DeskCart or any other clock installed! At least
   204	 sometimes it does, right now for example. I have not set the clock in
   205	 the XCONTROL panel (I hardly ever do). I turned my computer and hard
   206	 drive on today (Megafile 60) and used the programs TouchUp, Prism
   207	 Paint, PicSwitch, QuickCIS, EdHAK, Hotwire, Maxifile and maybe a few
   208	 others. But nowhere did I set the time. When I noticed this the other
   209	 day I thought later I'd imagined it! DeskCart used to be my time
   210	 keeper, but I took it out a few months ago. The CALendar accessory
   211	 also displays the correct month, day and year. This is really odd! I
   212	 know some HD's have clocks - could it be retaining the time from when
   213	 I used to have DeskCart?  Somehow I don't think so but I have no other
   214	 ideas. How can this possibly be happening?!! <g>
   215	
   216	 Not that I'm complaining, I like not having to set the clock!"
   217	
   218	 Sysop Bob Retelle tells Rob:
   219	
   220	
   221	 "What kind of hard drive interface do you have..?
   222	
   223	 Some of them have clocks built-in as an additional feature.
   224	
   225	 The way these things work is that there has to be an external clock
   226	 of some kind that keeps regular daily time...  then when you boot up
   227	 your ST, some kind of AUTO folder program has to read the time of day
   228	 out of the external clock and put it into the ST's internal clock.
   229	
   230	 (For example, I have a clock chip that hides in an IC socket that's
   231	 installed under one of the TOS ROM chips in my ST... and an AUTO
   232	 folder program that reads the time into the ST's internal clock at
   233	 boot up..)
   234	
   235	 If you *don't* have anything in your AUTO folder that would read the
   236	 time out of something...  and you  *don't*  have anything that would
   237	 store the current time-of-day when your ST is turned off, maybe it's
   238	 time to take it in for its 50,000 mile exorcism..."
   239	
   240	 Rob tells Bob:
   241	
   242	 "I don't know about the hard drive interface - the Megafile just plugs
   243	 into the ST's hard drive port.
   244	
   245	 My auto programs are Shadow, Warp 9, Desk Manager, Spooler, Codekeys,
   246	 LGS, Hotwire and REGACC (for Lookit and Popit). Nothing I know of here
   247	 that would set the clock. I used to have Codehead's CLOCKSET in the
   248	 auto folder, but removed it when I took out DeskCart. Nowhere in the
   249	 Megafile manual did I see mention of a clock. Totally strange!"
   250	
   251	 Rob tells Bob about one interesting finding:
   252	
   253	 "I just did a cold boot and after all the auto programs loaded, I
   254	 checked the control panel, it was the wrong time (April, '89). I
   255	 loaded a few other programs to see where this odd (but rather nice)
   256	 time-keeping ability kicks in.  Using QuickCIS to call Compuserve is
   257	 what does it!!!!
   258	
   259	 I made a Normal call, captured an announcement, a few messages and lib
   260	 descriptions , then it logged off. The Xcontrol panel now displays
   261	 the correct date and time! 7:31 AM 11/16/93. Any files I save are
   262	 saved with the correct time. This is one bug that I consider a
   263	 feature, but who can explain it? I know Hotwire has a clock, but other
   264	 than calling CIS, nothing in my system could be retaining the time,
   265	 unless it's the ghost of DeskCart. It resented being replaced by the
   266	 scanner! Seriously, could CIS be setting my clock???"
   267	
   268	 Jon Sanford tells Rob:
   269	
   270	 "I think it is a feature of QuickCIS to set the system clock if it is
   271	 off by more than a certain ammount. Amazing what little bits of info
   272	 stick after reading a doc. 4 or 6 times...."
   273	
   274	 Rob re-reads the documentation and tells Jon:
   275	
   276	 "Well, you're right! There it is, kinda hidden in the docs  :^}. How
   277	 come I never knew about this? Maybe since I had the cartridge clock I
   278	 ignored this nifty feature."
   279	
   280	 Bob Retelle jumps in and adds:
   281	
   282	 "Wow..  I knew QuickCIS was a good program, but this is pretty
   283	 amazing..!
   284	
   285	 Er.. that is..  Of course.. just another special little advantage of
   286	 using CompuServe and QuickCIS.."
   287	
   288	 Jim Ness, the creator of of QuickCis, tells us:
   289	
   290	 "That was a feature requested by James Port.  He had a 520ST with no
   291	 clock, but wanted his .MSG files to have a real timestamp.  So, I
   292	 worked out a routine which compared the CIS time to the ST time, and
   293	 if it was off by more than 24 hours the clock would be set to CIS
   294	 time.
   295	
   296	 The 24 hour deadband was to account for someone calling in at approx.
   297	 midnight, or someone calling across a time zone or three."
   298	
   299	 While on the subject of calling up an on-line service, Stefan Daystrom
   300	 talks a bit about Alan Page's latest "baby", STORM:
   301	
   302	 "This isn't exactly a bug, but I thought I'd point out one other
   303	 problem with your 7-scanline med rez font besides readability (and it
   304	 bothers me _more_ than the readability <grin!>):
   305	
   306	 It makes Storm _slow_!!!!!
   307	
   308	 Well, what it does is it makes graphics accelerators like TurboST
   309	 which accelerate the stock fonts (in TurboST's case, 8x16, 8x8, and
   310	 6x6) unable to kick in, thus reducing Storm to standard GEM speeds
   311	 (which makes it seem real slow compared to Flash, which _does_ run at
   312	 TurboST speeds).
   313	
   314	 I recall reading a message where you said it you were planning to
   315	 handle this by a special emulation; does that mean it could not be
   316	 combined with other emulations?  (On the other hand, do I still need
   317	 to use Vidtex on CIS just to be able to download using CIS B
   318	 protocols, as I did in Flash, or can I just use the same TTY emulation
   319	 for CIS as I do for most BBSs I call?  If the latter, then I'm less
   320	 worried about it being a special TTY emulation that might use the 8X8
   321	 font in med rez...)"
   322	
   323	 Alan Page tells Stefan (and the rest of us):
   324	
   325	 "Actually, ALL my GEM text is done using custom code, no matter what
   326	 the font.  Much of the speed comes from trying to update large blocks,
   327	 rather than one character at a time. I thought it was rather fast,
   328	 actually.  CIS-B will work with any of the terminal emulations. I
   329	 normally log on to CIS with VT100. VIDTEX, however, does have an
   330	 option in the setup to switch to an 8 scanline font, with 21 lines in
   331	 medium rez. Select "Emulations" in the Settings menu, click on VIDTEX,
   332	 then click on Config. Warning: switching will erase the terminal
   333	 screen!  When I finally publish some source, people will be able to
   334	 customize the emulations extensively, including the ability to use
   335	 stock GEM text."
   336	
   337	 Stefan Daystrom tells Alan:
   338	
   339	 "Hm, I may have crossed circuits to jump to conclusions <grin / red
   340	 face>!
   341	
   342	 I don't have a 9600/14400 modem yet, so my sense of speed was not
   343	 based on _online_ speed (I've never seen it get behind relative to the
   344	 RD light on my modem, though it somehow _feels_ as if the pacing is
   345	 different than I'm used to!) as much as the speed with which the
   346	 window redraws when I flip between the capture buffer and terminal
   347	 windows.
   348	
   349	 But now that I look at it closer, the delay I see is probably just
   350	 the window drawing white behind the text, when it's topped, before the
   351	 text is drawn.
   352	
   353	 If I'm spoiled by even _greater_ speed, I realize now that's it's
   354	 from using QCMsg_II, which doesn't _need_ to redraw the window when I
   355	 flip between messages, _only_ the text.  So _obviously_ it's going to
   356	 be faster since it has less to do!
   357	
   358	 So you're right, the text is actually rather fast!  Sorry for making
   359	 assumptions..."
   360	
   361	
   362	 From the Atari ST Arts Forum
   363	 ============================
   364	
   365	 Shawn Laughnin asks:
   366	
   367	 "Does the Atari require a special (i.e. Atari) joystick? I remember a
   368	 time you could buy a host of generic joysticks in chain stores. Its
   369	 been a while since I've noticed them ."
   370	
   371	 Sysop Bob Retelle tells Shawn:
   372	
   373	 "Yup, the "Atari Joystick" is a thing of the past, just like most
   374	 things Atari..
   375	
   376	 Used to be any joystick had to be "Atari compatible"... now they're
   377	 all Nintendo..  I wonder why that is..."
   378	
   379	 Master Sysop Ron Luks adds his own thoughts:
   380	
   381	 "Yes, the Atari uses a special joystick.  There used to be scads of
   382	 different brands of joysticks that worked on your atari (anything that
   383	 used to be compatible with the former industry standard Atari 2600
   384	 game machine and 8-bit computers) but these are becoming hard to
   385	 find."
   386	
   387	 Rob Rasmussen asks about "doing" graphics with some of the whiz-bang
   388	 graphics packages out there:
   389	
   390	 "...The positioning of 16 colors/shades of gray in the palette - that's
   391	 what I don't get. I'm used to coming from the other direction, where I
   392	 create a picture in Prism Paint, starting on a blank screen with
   393	 default colors in the palette which I can change. But how does a
   394	 scanned picture, or the software TouchUp, decide which position in the
   395	 palette a gray, black or white will be?  Even if I can use the feature
   396	 in Degas Elite and PP that maps the colors gradually between any two,
   397	 I'm still stuck with maybe 2 objects on the screen that I want to be
   398	 different colors, but they can't be because they're in the same
   399	 palette position. If I scan a picture lighter, there may be more
   400	 shades of gray and maybe certain pixels would be in different pal
   401	 positions, but the picture looks undefined with not enough detail.
   402	
   403	 I saved some scans as GIFs, others as PC1. I only have a color
   404	 monitor. When I try to load a GIF, I get a dialog with a 'gray scale'
   405	 button (using this makes everything too dark) and the dimensions of
   406	 the GIF which I find will not fit on the screen. Other scans will all
   407	 fit on the screen. It looks like the GIF really is just the top of the
   408	 scan - there is no way to scroll or print it. Any comments anyone?
   409	 This really is all a puzzle I hope to understand one day!"
   410	
   411	 Lee Seiler of Lexicore Software tells Rob:
   412	
   413	 "First install EP10 so you have access to 4096 colors, Next use Prism
   414	 Paint for the whole job. Hold the Alt Key when booting to get the
   415	 Grey scale Select dialog.  Then, when you load the color pic it will
   416	 auto Grey scale, the machine pallet will also have the correct Grey
   417	 scales auto set. Now when you save out as a PI file it will be in 8
   418	 grey scales including the required desk top reserved pallet."
   419	
   420	 Rob asks for clarification:
   421	
   422	 "I have an ST, not an STE. I thought I was limited to 512 colors. What
   423	 is EP10 and where can I get it? If I can get 4096 colors then this is
   424	 incredible!"
   425	
   426	 Lee explains to Rob:
   427	
   428	 "Many, many ST owners have installed the video shifter from JRI but
   429	 never realized that the 4096 colors were not always there, this is
   430	 also the case with the STE, Mega STE, and TT.  Many programs which
   431	 could use the 4096 don't, due to a little tic in the OS, EP10 deals
   432	 with this problem and while no difference is apparent, things like GIF
   433	 and Spectrum Images are much richer and look better because you see
   434	 "Better or More correctly matched colors" and with software that does
   435	 access the full 4096 you see a slight increase in speed, or so I am
   436	 told.
   437	
   438	 You get EP10 Free with all Lexicor purchases, we put it on all
   439	 current Utilitiy and resource disk sold with Lexicor products."
   440	
   441	 Rob tells Lee:
   442	
   443	 "I looked for EP10 on my Lexicor disks, but those are older programs,
   444	 so I guess it wasn't included. You mentioned the JRI video shifter -
   445	 is this required for an older ST to get 4096 colors? I would LOVE to
   446	 have more screen colors than 512 to choose from. Often I want colors
   447	 that are between 2 available ones that are right next to each other.
   448	
   449	 The picture I'm starting out with is a mono IMG and PI3. Is this what
   450	 I could gray scale before converting to low rez PNT or PI1 ? If I can
   451	 do this on an ST with EP10, then I'll need to get that or something
   452	 similar."
   453	
   454	 Lee explains exactly what is needed:
   455	
   456	 "Yes and no.
   457	
   458	 You do need the JRI hardware first, if you have the STE, the 4096 are
   459	 there but unaccesable. EP10 fixes the bug for all 4096 systems no
   460	 matter how it happens.  If you are using the PI3 you should be able to
   461	 load it into a grey scale Prism paint mode of at least 16 shades of
   462	 grey.
   463	
   464	 This then is saved as a Gif which can then be reloaded into a color
   465	 Gif which you can then reset from grey to color and save as color.
   466	
   467	 EP10 is in all our libs as far as I know, knock on Ringo's door and
   468	 ask him to point you at it or E-Mail it to you."
   469	
   470	 Mike Myers asks Sysop Ron Luks about converting Atari files over to
   471	 DOS (I know, I know, I've mentioned this a lot... but the question
   472	 keeps getting asked, so I guess that not everyone reads this column
   473	 all the time [and you know who you are]):
   474	
   475	 "Is there a program available which will allow the conversion of ATARI
   476	 ST .lzh files to IBM .gif files / .jpg files and back?  I have an IBM
   477	 and a friend has a ST.  We have looked in the forums under viewers,
   478	 utilities, and anything else we could think of."
   479	
   480	 Before Ron can answer, Sysop Bob Retelle tells Mike:
   481	
   482	 "There should be a conversion program that will run on an ST and
   483	 convert DEGAS format pictures to GIF, which your friend could display
   484	 on his IBM..
   485	
   486	 It's been a looong time since I remember seeing it, but I think its
   487	 filename was something like  CNV2GIF.   There should also be something
   488	 similar that will convert Spectrum 512 pictures to GIF format too, but
   489	 the name of that one eludes me at this moment.
   490	
   491	 As for converting the other way, there shouldn't be a need to convert
   492	 GIFs and JPGs, since we have some pretty good viewer programs for the
   493	 ST for those graphics formats."
   494	
   495	 Ron Luks tells Mike:
   496	
   497	 "LZH is a compression method.  GIF is a picture file format.
   498	
   499	 There is an LZH utility for the PC.  (LZH files are created/processed
   500	 witha utility called LHARC).  Think of LZH as another type of ARC or
   501	 ZIP files. GIF is a graphics picture format like TIFF, or PCX, etc.
   502	 One has nothing to do with the other.
   503	
   504	 I dont know of any JPEG utilities for the Atari ST."
   505	
   506	 Boris Molodyi jumps in and adds:
   507	
   508	 "As I recall, GEMVIEW loads JPEG files (and so you can save them in
   509	 different format). Also, Studio Photo from Compo can load JPEG pics."
   510	
   511	 A column containing both the words "Atari" and "Graphics" wouldn't be
   512	 complete without mentioning the Jaguar, Atari's hot new video game
   513	 machine.  Bob Retelle posts:
   514	
   515	 "One thing I've been wondering though.. since Atari has said virtually
   516	 nothing concrete about the Jaguar beyond the official Press Releases,
   517	 and about the only other source of real information was the Press
   518	 conference they held recently in New York, just what exactly is all
   519	 the "Jaguar talk" you mentioned about..?
   520	
   521	 There's a "lot of Jaguar talk" on the InterNet newsgroups too... but
   522	 most of it is just rumors and unfounded speculation, along with the
   523	 "3DO vs Jaguar" flaming that never gets anywhere...
   524	
   525	 Jaguar developers are under NonDisclosure Agreements, so they can't
   526	 say anything, and the only other source of Jaguar "news" has been
   527	 leaks from some of the companies working on games.
   528	
   529	 It just seems that "a lot of Jaguar talk" would be pretty useless
   530	 until we actually get to see and use the machines themselves... once
   531	 that happens, I'm sure the areas here will pick up.."
   532	
   533	 John Brenner tells Bob:
   534	
   535	 "All the Jaguar talk on GEnie is trivial. Everone asking eachother if
   536	 they saw the commercial. How great it looks. How well it is being
   537	 marketed. Which store chain has confirmed if they are going to carry
   538	 it. There is also some people talking about having ordered one and
   539	 that some stores have already pre-sold hundreds of units. It's like a
   540	 bunch of sports fans rallying around a sports team. Talking about the
   541	 new uniforms, or the new stadium. No better, no worse. I have no
   542	 interest in such things, but I have not bothered Ignoring permanently
   543	 that CAT. Perhaps because I enjoy looking at so many happy people."
   544

   546	 From the Atari Vendor's Forum
   547	 =============================
   548	
   549	 Rafael Hermoso asks:
   550	
   551	 "Is Neodesk 4 out yet? If not, when? If so, where can I purchase it?"
   552	
   553	 Rick Flashman of Gribnif Software tells Rafael:
   554	
   555	 "No, NeoDesk 4 is not out yet.  We've been forced to delay its
   556	 shipping until early '94.  Part of this delay was that we wanted to
   557	 insure that Geneva was as bug-free as possible and that we had
   558	 resolved any minor issued that might have arisen as of its initial
   559	 release.  We now believe this strategy has paid off, as we've been
   560	 able to correct some minor problems with Geneva (that only showed up
   561	 after shipping) and therefore we now have a substancially more solid
   562	 package."
   563	
   564	 John Brenner tells us:
   565	
   566	 "After many years I am still using INTERLINK to do any BBS'ing
   567	 outside of GEnie. I have just D/L a file on this system and did
   568	 not remember how slow XMODEM transfer was. Are there any Interlink
   569	 TXF files in the libraries that support the other protocals available
   570	 on Compuserve. And which one is most recommended?"
   571	
   572	 Jim Ness nudges John about "getting with it":
   573	
   574	 "Geez, John, with all the terrific ST terminal programs out there, you
   575	 are still using good old Interlink?  There's Flash II, STalker, and
   576	 now the shareware gem STorm...
   577	
   578	 All three of those support CIS B and ymodem-g, the two fastest
   579	 protocols."
   580	
   581	 John tells Jim:
   582	
   583	 "I used to have Flash before I got Interlink many years ago. I never
   584	 looked at Flash II since I never liked Flash to begin with. I D/L
   585	 STorm last week. I also dont' like very much the way it is set up.
   586	 I have a friend who uses STalker. He has to buy another program to
   587	 do on-line editing. So, I just don't see the need to change. I have
   588	 a capture buffer, I can edit, save paste...everything I need.
   589	 I use Alladin, you know where, and now it looks like I will use
   590	 QuickCIS to log on here. So I really don't see why I should change.
   591	 I only upgrade software that no longer suits my needs.
   592	
   593	 I was starting to think I might need something for here since I
   594	 couldn't get QuickCIS to dial, but all has now fallen into place
   595	 and I think I'll be very happy with it. Thanks for writting it.
   596	 I'll have to read the doc....there must be a fee for something
   597	 that will save me so much money! <Grin>"

   600	 From the Palmtop Forum
   601	 ======================
   602	
   603	 Kent Peterson pats the Compuserve Sysops' proficiency at getting new
   604	 files (like Kent's new programming language) "up and ready":
   605	
   606	 "You guys are a lot faster than the sysops of some other forums. BTW,
   607	 the HP folks seem to be going into a download frenzy on this little
   608	 bit of Port technology, I decided to cast their way. Did you ever post
   609	 PBASIC over there?"
   610	
   611	 We're still waiting for and answer from BJ... that kind of negates
   612	 the compliment in the first place, doesn't it?...
   613	
   614	 Don Thomas of Atari Corp posts:
   615	
   616	 "Every once in a while I am beginning to see messages in langauages
   617	 other than English... German, for instance. It sure would be cool if
   618	 CIS had some sort of translation process built-in... either on demand
   619	 or automatically."
   620	
   621	 Sysop BJ Gleason tells Don:
   622	
   623	 "As a person who has done a lot of work with Natural Language
   624	 Processing and such, it is a very tough, if not impossible task.  One
   625	 of the best jokes about it is:
   626	
   627	        A program translates from russian to english and back.  The
   628	        program puts in the phrase:
   629	
   630	                "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
   631	
   632	        It is translated to russian, and then the russian is fed back
   633	        and the translation comes back as:
   634	
   635	                "The wine is good but the meat is spoiled."
   636	
   637	 Back on the subject of the Jaguar again, Don Thomas tells us:
   638	
   639	 "I stopped by an Electronics Boutique this past weekend in Pleasanton,
   640	 CA (40-50 miles East of San Francisco). I pretended to be Joe Blow
   641	 consumer and observed two 3DO systems on a shelf. The salesman said
   642	 they are not selling well, BUT he would love to take my pre-order for
   643	 the Jaguar. He said he didn't know what game came with it or how many
   644	 controllers, but that he couldn't find an end to the waiting list the
   645	 store had established for the Jaguar. It felt good.
   646	
   647	 My son even said this past Friday without me asking that all the kids
   648	 at school were talking about the Jaguar (he's ten). He told me that he
   649	 felt good telling his friends that his Dad worked at Atari."
   650	
   651	
   652	      Well folks,  I intended to  use use information on  other palmtops in
   653	 this column but, as usual, I've run out of room.
   654	
   655	      So  c'mon back next week and see  what else I can shoe-horn into this
   656	 column.  Just think of it  as some little sports bar somewhere  in Boston.
   657	 A place  where... oh  heck, I've gone  this far.   I'd  might as well  say
   658	 it... A place where  everybody knows your name.   It's easy to  just leave
   659	 your troubles at  the door for a while and absorb some of the hints, tips,
   660	 and information available  on CompuServe.  But  if you don't  subscribe to
   661	 CompuServe, this column is the next-best thing.   Just make sure that  you
   662	 remember to listen to what they are saying
   663	 when...
